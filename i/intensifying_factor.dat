40|$|Teachers {{are facing}} an {{increasing}} number of changes in their job context, many of which signicantly affect their work lives. This study offers a theoretical understanding of the changes in teachers’ working conditions, starting from the intensification thesis. The case study of a Flemish (Belgian) elementary school shows the existence of various and mutually reinforcing sources of intensification. Those sources emerge not only from outside school (e. g. policy-makers and society), but also as teachers impose their own standards on their work. The case study exemplifies the compelling (and thus intensifying) character of a collective norm of willingness to innovate. However, this norm seems to act paradoxically: both as a support in dealing with external pressure and as an <b>intensifying</b> <b>factor,</b> increasing the workload. The possibly intensifying impact of changes on teachers’ working conditions is mediated by the school organization as well as the personal interpretative framework (sense-making) of individual teachers. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a newmethod for direct measure-ment of Mode-I stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor</b> of cracks using Ba 0. 64 Sr 0. 36 TiO 3 flexoelectric strain gradient sensors. Firstly, strain gradient field around the opening mode crack tip was analyzed, {{followed by the}} derivation of induced flexoelectric polarization in the strain gradient sensors attached {{in the vicinity of}} a crack tip. It was found that the constant stress termmakes no contribution to the strain gradient, thus the flexoelectric output directly reflects the singular effect. This unique property elimi-nates the special requirement for sensor placement coordinates and improves the accuracy of the stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor</b> predica-tion. A specimen with Mode-I crack was then prepared with two strain gradient sensors (4. 7 mm× 0. 9 mm× 0. 3 mm) attached close to the crack tip to verify the analytical model for measure-ments of stress intensity factor. The experimental results matched well with the empirical estimation confirming that flexoelectric strain gradient sensing can be a convenient and accurate avenue for measuring the stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R

A {{theoretical}} {{discussion has}} been presented for the ductile chip formation in grinding of brittle materials. The single abrasive grit was dealt with a top-rounded cutter removing material of varying undeformed chip thickness. The force model in the chip formation zone was established. The stress analysis showed that larger compressive stress and shear stress can be generated in the chip formation zone, which shields the growth of pre-existing flaws in the material by suppressing the stress intensity factor. When the stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor</b> is smaller than fracture toughness and the resolved shear stress exceeds the critical flow stress of the material, the ductile chip is formed.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} 2 D LEFM crack propagation simulation is presented. This uses a Lepp–Delaunay based mesh refinement algorithm for triangular meshes which allows both {{the generation of}} the initial mesh and the local modification of the current mesh as the crack propagates. For any triangle t, Lepp(t) (Longest Edge Propagation Path of t) is a finite, ordered list of increasing longest edge neighbor triangles, that allows to find a pair of triangles over which mesh refinement operations are easily and locally performed. This is particularly useful for fracture mechanics analysis, where high gradients of element size are needed. The crack propagation is simulated by using a finite element model for each crack propagation step, then the mesh near the crack tip is modified {{to take into account}} the crack advance. Stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated using the displacement extrapolation technique while the crack propagation angle is calculated using the maximum circumferential stress method. Empirical testing shows that the behavior of the method is in complete agreement with experimental results reported in the literature.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} polyvinyl butyral (PVB) sig-nificantly influences crashworthiness and energy miti-gation abilities of windshields in terms of pedestrian safety. In this article, mechanical characteristics of PVB are experimentally studied. First, tension and compression experiments on PVB specimen are car-ried out under various quasi-static loading rates. Fun-damental mechanism of rate-dependent behavior is investigated. Besides, dynamic tension and compres-sion experimental data are compared to investigate the mechanical behavior of PVB in a whole strain rate region and {{it is found that}} PVB behaves as a visco-elastic material under compressive loadings in both quasi-static and dynamic situations; however, in ten-sion experiments, stress–strain curves of PVB under dynamic loadings are elasto-plastic while those under quasi-static loadings are visco-elastic. Considering all the unique characteristics of PVB’s behavior, constitu-tive models are then established based on Zhu-Wang-Tang model mathematically. Further, unit volume energy absorption of every experiment in quasi-static tension and compression are calculated as well as the stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor.</b> In addition, visco-elasticity part in the constitutive model is employed. Results may offer useful experiment data and important constitutive characteristics of PVB material to further studies of automotive crashworthiness and pedestrian protec...|$|R

The present study is based on Muzaffarabad, which lies in the lesser Himalayas. Geologically, the Kashmir Himalaya is the young and most dynamic system in the world. In Muzaffarabad, mostly, people live on the fragile mountain slopes, and therefore, they are highly vulnerable {{to the risk of}} landslides. To achieve the objectives of the study, data were collected both from primary and secondary sources. Primary data were obtained through intensive field work and human perception survey, while secondary data were obtained from the related line agencies. The analysis reveals that in the study area, immature geology, active seismic zone, wide range of temperature and seasonal rain are the major physical factors, whereas human interventions on the fragile slopes are <b>intensifying</b> <b>factors</b> which in effect contribute to the landslide incidence. As a result, the adverse impacts on housing, sources of livelihood earnings and human casualties are escalating day-by-day.

Conventional methods of oil recovery and stimulation of well productivity applied on heavy oil fields are often ineffective, in this regard, the increase in the efficiency of geological and technical measures at such objects is becoming increasingly dependent on the concentration of <b>intensifying</b> <b>factors</b> of influence on the reservoir and the proper choice of technology in accordance with geological and geophysical conditions. The authors have developed and introduced into production the resource-saving technology of complex stimulation on the productive layer, which includes a combination of physical, chemical, thermal and hydrodynamic factors of stimulation. A rational combination of these factors made it possible to increase the efficiency of developing a heavy oil deposit – to stabilize the decline and increase oil production. Technologically, the implemented development method consists in injecting hot water into the injection wells with a calculated content of surfactants. Associated gas of this section of the field, previously burned on the flare, is used as fuel for heating water.

40|$|AbstractThe {{advantage}} of the new compressed natural gas (CNG) marine transportation technology is less investment in infrastructure and greater flexibility. It is highly competitive as compared to pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport for distances of up to 2, 500 – 3, 000 nautical miles. Due to the high pressure inside CNG containers, its safety is the first important factor to be considered. Leak-before-break (LBB) is an important methodology of maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels. However, the Joule-Thomson (JT) cooling effect occurred during a leak may impact {{the validity of the}} LBB approach. In this paper, a looping model based on MATLAB software is developed starting with the gas at room temperature and 250 bar at the entrance of the crack. From this, the pressure and JT temperature drop is calculated initially, which in turn affects the gas properties, such as viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients. Heat transfer and FEA analysis using a 3 D model of the plate with a central through-thickness crack are carried out. Under the internal pressure of 250 bar, the temperature drop and the stress intensity factor {{in the vicinity of the}} crack is 59. 7 °C and 120 MPa· m 1 / 2, respectively. The stress <b>intensify</b> <b>factor</b> obtained is higher than the fracture toughness of the material at the same low temperature. However, the structure may not experience a catastrophic failure.

Thus {{it is crucial to}} investigate these <b>intensifying</b> <b>factors.</b> These factors emphasise increasing sugar beet cultivation profitability and efficiency. 	The aim of this thesis was to tackle the challenge of autumn and spring tillage, fertilizer application depth, and to evaluate the impact of specific applications with nitrogen phosporus fertilizers Ammophos and Lovostart on yield and quality of sugar beet. 	Pilot experiments were established for assessing the impact of tillage and mineral fertilizers application depth in the growing year 2014 / 2015 on grounds of agricultural company Sloveč Inc. These pilot experiments were established in eight variants The first pilot: Check variant: no fertilizers The second pilot: application of Ammophos 150 kg. ha- 1 at 10 cm depth, and Lovostart 150 kg. ha- 1 to 30 cm depth. The third pilot: surface application and incorporation of Ammophos 150 kg. ha- 1. The fourth pilot: application of Ammophos 150 kg. ha- 1 at 10 cm depth. The fifth pilot: application of Ammophos 150 kg. ha- 1 at 20 cm depth. The sixth pilot: application of Ammophos 150 kg. ha- 1 at 30 cm depth. The seventh pilot: application of Lovostart 150 kg. ha- 1 at 20 cm depth. The eight pilot: application of Lovostart 150 kg. ha- 1 at 30 cm depth. 	At harvest, bulb samples were taken from each pilot areas for a technological analysis. To include: determination of the sugar content, the content of alfa amino nitrogen, potassium, and sodium. Based on these indicators was calculated the yield of white sugar. 	The comparison shows the depot application of Lovostart 150 kg. ha- 1 at 20 cm depth variant proved to be the most optimal solution for achieving the highest yields. 	 	Based on the beet sugar content achieved, in relation with the nitrogen phosporus fertilizer application depth appeared as the best variant the variant with Ammophos in dose of 150 kg. ha- 1 at 20 cm depth. These variant was the best option for achieving the highest sugar content. The sugar content There reached 20, 84 %.

40|$|Foragers occupying Dzombo Shelter, eastern Botswana, and {{producing}} a Later Stone Age technology {{came into contact}} with incoming Iron Age food-producers at approximately AD 350. From the onset of their interactions the Later Stone Age record began to change. One such change was in stone tool preference; over much of southern Africa scraper frequencies increased whereas backed tools declined. However, between c. AD 900 and 1200 at Dzombo, backed tools inexplicably dominate the formal tool assemblage. This paper seeks to understand the role of backed tools at Dzombo from before the arrival of farmers until the establishment of the Mapungubwe state, c.

By performing a macro-fracture analysis it was possible to demonstrate an increased occurrence of fractures consistent with impact-related damage between approximately AD 350 and 1200, and it is suggested here that during this time hunting activities were <b>intensified.</b> The <b>factors</b> possibly driving this intensification are discussed and could relate to forager-farmer interactions or a shift in the site’s function.
