In width of mouth I have found a great difference in two Swallows. In Fantails of first-rate merit I have seen some birds with much longer and thinner necks than in others. Other analogous facts could be given. We have seen that the oil-gland is aborted in all Fantails (with the exception of the sub-race from Java), and, I may add, so hereditary is this tendency to abortion, that some, although not all, of the mongrels which I reared from the Fantail and Pouter had no oil-gland; in one Swallow out of many which I have examined, and in two Nuns, there was no oil-gland.|$|E

50|$|Isolation is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> from an {{unwanted}} signal detected {{at the port}} of interest. Isolation becomes more important at higher frequencies. High isolation reduces the influence of signals from other channels, sustains the integrity of the measured signal, and reduces system measurement uncertainties. For instance, a switch matrix may need to route a signal to a spectrum analyzer for measurement at -70 dBm and to simultaneously route another signal at +20 dBm. In this case, switches with high isolation, 90 dB or more, will keep the measurement integrity of the low-power signal.|$|E

50|$|As the {{wavefront}} of {{the ground}} wave travels along the Earth's surface it is attenuated. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> is dependent upon a variety of factors. Frequency of the radio signal {{is one of the}} major determining factor as losses rise with increasing frequency. As a result, it makes this form of propagation impracticable above the bottom end of the HF portion of the spectrum (3 MHz). Typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB more than one at 0.5 MHz dependent upon a variety of factors in the signal path including the distance. In view of this it can be seen why even high power HF radio broadcast stations may only be audible for a few miles from the transmitting site via the ground wave.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: With the {{expansion}} of whole-genome studies, there is rapid evolution of genotyping platforms. This leads to practical issues such as upgrading of genotyping equipment which often results in research groups having data from different platforms for the same samples. While having more data can potentially yield more accurate copy-number estimates, combining such data is not straightforward as different platforms show different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the true copy-number or different noise characteristics and marker panels. Currently, {{there is still a}} relative lack of procedures for combining information from different platforms. Results: We develop a method – called MPSS – based on a correlated random-effect model for the unobserved patterns and extend the robust smooth segmentation approach (Huang et al., 2007) to the multiple-platform scenario. We also propose an objective criterion for discrete segmentation required for downstream analyses. For each identified segment, the software reports a p-value to indicate the likelihood of the segment being a true CNV.

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} {{aimed to develop}} a {{technique}} for calculating the magnetic characteristics of uncompensated traction electric motors (TEM) at any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> of excitation based on the approximating expression for improved universal magnetic characteristics (UMC). It is also necessary to conduct an analysis of expressions for improved UMC {{with the aim of}} finding an expression that most fully satisfies the requirements for developing a technique for determining the inductive parameters of TEM. Methodology. It is necessary to determine the saturation coefficient for each <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> of the excitation for building the characteristics with the improved UMC. This can only be done analytically. To simplify the analytical finding of the saturation coefficient, the method based on solving a system of two equations is proposed, one of which is UMC itself, and the second one is a straight line whose angular coefficient is proportional to the saturation coefficient. Resulting values of the saturation coefficient for the excitation degrees β < 1 are essentially the coefficients of the shape of the magnetic characteristic. To get rid of the need to determine the coefficients of approximation each time in the calculation of characteristics a form of improved UMC is proposed, in which the magnetomotive force (MMF) of the excitation winding serves as the argument's role. Findings. Using the improved UMC it is possible to calculate the characteristics of uncompensated TEMs for any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> of excitation. The accuracy of the calculation at β = 1 does not differ from that in the calculation for UMC, proposed by Prof. M. D. Nakhodkin. The same accuracy is preserved at excitation degrees that are different from unity. Originality. An analytical technique for calculating the magnetic (speed) characteristics of uncompensated TEM for any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> {{with the help of an}} improved UMC is proposed. The analytical technique for determining the saturation coefficient for an improved UMC at any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> of excitation is also proposed.

40|$|Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 {{and type}} 2 are {{responsible}} for recurrent orolabial and genital infections. The standard therapy {{for the management of}} HSV infections includes acyclovir (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV) with their respective prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir. These compounds are phosphorylated by the viral thymidine kinase (TK) and then by cellular kinases. The triphosphate forms selectively inhibit the viral DNA polymerase (DNA pol) activity. Drug-resistant HSV isolates are frequently recovered from immunocompromised patients but rarely found in immunocompetent subjects. The gold standard phenotypic method for evaluating the susceptibility of HSV isolates to antiviral drugs is the plaque reduction assay. Plaque autoradiography allows the associated phenotype to be distinguished (TK-wild-type, TK-negative, TK-low-producer, or TK-altered viruses or mixtures of wild-type and mutant viruses). Genotypic characterization of drug-resistant isolates can reveal mutations located in the viral TK and/or in the DNA pol genes. Recombinant HSV mutants can be generated to analyze the contribution of each specific mutation with regard to the drug resistance phenotype. Most ACV-resistant mutants exhibit some reduction in their capacity to establish latency and to reactivate, as well as in their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> neurovirulence in animal models of HSV infection. For instance, TK-negative HSV mutants establish latency with a lower efficiency than wild-type strains and reactivate poorly.

40|$|The present neuroimaging study {{examines}} how repetition-related neural attenuation effects differ {{as a function}} of the perceptual similarity of the repetition and subsequent memory. One previous study (Turk-Browne et al., 2006) reported greater attenuation effects for subsequent hits than for misses. Another study (Wagner et al., 2000) found that neural attenuation is negatively correlated with subsequent memory. These opposing results suggest that repetition-related neural attenuation for subsequent hits and misses may be driven by different factors. In order to investigate the factors that affect the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> neural <b>attenuation,</b> we varied perceptual similarity between repetitions in a scanned encoding phase that was followed by a subsequent memory test outside the scanner. We demonstrated that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> neural <b>attenuation</b> in the object processing regions depends on the interaction between perceptual similarity across repeated presentations and the quality their encodings. Specifically, the same areas that decreased neural signal for repetitions of same exemplars that were subsequently recognized with confidence that the repetitions were identical showed a decrease in neural signal for different-exemplar misses but not for the corresponding subsequently recognized hits. Our results imply that repetition-related neural attenuation should be related to the more efficient processing of perceptual properties of the stimuli only if subjects are able to subsequently remember the stimuli. Otherwise, the cause <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> may be in the failure to encode the stimuli on the second presentation as shown by the pattern <b>of</b> neural <b>attenuation</b> for the different-exemplar misses...|$|R
