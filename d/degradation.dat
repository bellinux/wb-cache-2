5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein <b>degradation</b> in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein <b>degradation</b> in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular <b>degradation</b> mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic <b>degradation,</b> known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein <b>degradation</b> was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E

In general, it is preferred to keep the radiation dose as low as possible during the CT examinations to prevent patients as well as operators from the dangerous side effects of these radiations, which in an extreme case may lead to cancer. However, reducing the radiation dose leads to undesirable <b>degradations</b> which not only reduce the visual quality of CT images, but also make such images difficult to interpret in clinical routines. The most common <b>degradations</b> in low-dose CT images include blur, noise and low-contrast.
