50|$|The {{preferred}} {{scenario for}} <b>good</b> <b>tilth</b> is {{as the result}} of natural soil-building processes, provided by the activity of plant roots, microorganisms, earthworms and other beneficial organisms. Such stable aggregates break apart during tillage/planting and readily provide <b>good</b> <b>tilth.</b> Stable aggregates are held together by organic bonds that resist breakdown during soil saturation. These organic materials are themselves subject to biological degradation, requiring active amendments with organic material, and minimal mechanical tillage.|$|E

Many surface management techniques can be adopted which affect soil structure through formation as well as stabilization of aggregates. The changes brought about in the soil shuctural features are reflected in soil physical properties such as porosity. bulk density, aggregate slabity, sorptivity, hydraulic conductivity, steady-state flow rate, man pore size etc. Soil shucture is not a static property and changes with water content and other agencies of stress. The formation of aggregates and pores and their stabilization is very ilnportant to maintain a good soil structure and to increase productivity of the soils.

50|$|In the {{granular}} structure, {{the structural}} units are approximately spherical or polyhedral and are bounded by curved or very irregular faces {{that are not}} casts of adjoining peds. In other words, they look like cookie crumbs. Granular structure is common in the surface soils of rich grasslands and highly amended garden soils with high organic matter content. Soil mineral particles are both separated and bridged by organic matter breakdown products, and soil biota exudates, making the soil easy to work. Cultivation, earthworms, frost action and rodents mix the soil and decreases {{the size of the}} peds. This structure allows for good porosity and easy movement of air and water. This combination of ease in tillage, good moisture and air handling capabilities, and good structure for planting and germination, are definitive of the phrase <b>good</b> <b>tilth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a <b>good</b> <b>tilth</b> or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems of soil management is the formation and conservation of good soil tilth. A soil may be considered to be in <b>good</b> <b>tilth</b> when the draft required for pulling a plow or other tillage implement is low; thus, the soil is easily worked down into a good seed bed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure by the determination of some physical properties, how soil tilth is influenced by subsurface tillage compared to plowing, under field conditions. From the studies made, no differences in soil tilth were found between subsurface tillage and plowing as measured by volume weight, specific gravity, total porosity and compaction. A highly significant difference was found in the effect of sub-tilling as compared with plowing on increasing the stability of soil aggregates to water drops in the zero to one inch layer and a significant difference at the 5 % lever in the one to three inch layer.

40|$|Corn is king in Iowa. But corn {{should not}} be grown continuously. It should be rotated with small grains, clover or alfalfa. Such a {{rotation}} insures a good nitrogen level in the soil, cuts down on erosion, and helps keep the soil in <b>good</b> <b>tilth.</b> These factors in turn result in higher corn yields. Too often we neglect or omit our small grains and seedings because they don’t give us the high cash return of corn. One way {{to make them more}} profitable is to increase their yields. You can give the yields a real boost with fertilizers. There are two ways to use fertilizers on small grains and forages— the,right and the wrong. Among other things, the right way involves using the correct kind and amount of fertilizer, applying it effectively to the soil and at the best time. You must know how to do these things. They will determine the returns you will get from your fertilizer. To give you the best possible information on these points, the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station has conducted several hundred experiments on the fields over the state during the past few years. It is the purpose of this bulletin to give you the information gathered from these experiments along with other pointers to help you in your fertilizer program...|$|E
40|$|Garden symphylans (Scutiger-ella immaculata Newport) are small, white, “centipede-like ” soil arthropods, {{common in}} many {{agricultural}} production systems in Oregon, Washing-ton, and California (Berry and Robinson, 1974; Michelbacher, 1935). They feed on roots and other subter-ranean plant parts, causing significant crop losses in some cases. Control {{can be extremely}} difficult due to symphylans’ vertical movement in the soil, the com-lexity of sampling, {{and the lack of}} sim-ple, effective control methods (Umble and Fisher, 2003 a). With the recent spread of organic agri-culture and better soil management tech-niques, crop damage associated with sym-phylans has become more commonplace. It is ironic that these pests are such a problem on farms that practice good soil management — maintaining soil with <b>good</b> <b>tilth,</b> high organic matter, and low compaction. Damage Diagnosing a garden symphylan prob-lem is sometimes difficult, since damage may be exhibited in a number of forms and garden symphylans are not always easy to find, even when their damage is obvious. Economic damage may result from direct feeding on root and tuber crops and reduced stands of direct-seeded or transplanted crops (Umble and Fisher, 2003 a). However, most commonly, root feed-ing reduces the crop’s ability to take up water and nutrients, which leads to gen-eral stunting. Root damage may also render plants A garden symphylan {{is about the size of}} this letter ”l. ” Soils with high organic matter, good structure, and reduced disturbance, as in these hand-dug garden beds, are ideal habitat for garden symphylans...|$|E
40|$|Citation: Meyer Jr., Richard. Comparative {{study of}} soils. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: All soils may be {{compared}} in two very distinct ways, one {{with respect to}} the chemical composition and the other the physical condition of the soil, the first dealing mainly with the amount and quality of plant food, while the latter deals with the texture of the soil and its relation to plant development. The physical condition of a soil is to a large extent due to the treatment it receives in the way of cultivation. And the fact that a soil is in <b>good</b> <b>tilth</b> can easily be recognized by the increased vigor of the plants grown upon that soil. A good physical condition of the soil is obtained largely by the work of the different implements of tillage and the various ways and times of the year these implements are used, and is therefore largely under the control of man. By changing the physical condition of the soil is the best and about the only way the agriculturist has of regulating and controlling the movements of water and air in the soil, two of the most important factors which aid in the upbuilding and maintaining of a soil. It has been found that different soils act differently toward the movements of water and air and {{it is for this reason}} the following comparisons are made. Since the water is held in the soil primarily by a farce known as surface tension, the object should be to have a given volume of soil contain as much of the soil grain surface as possible, and in view of the fact that the extent of this surface will vary inversely as the diameter of the soil grains it is evident why a soil with small grains should hold the most water. The total soil grain surface also varies with the amount of compacting the soil has received...|$|E
