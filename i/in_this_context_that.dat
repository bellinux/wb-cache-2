5|$|It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Abu Taghlib {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 964, {{when his father}} had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E
5|$|While Marguerite Louise's {{behaviour}} was tolerated by {{the previous}} Abbess of Montmartre, the new Abbess, Madame d'Harcourt, frequently complained about her to the Grand Duke and the King. In retaliation, Marguerite Louise threatened to kill the Abbess with a hatchet and a pistol, and formed a clique against her. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Cosimo III consented, in line with her wishes, to Marguerite Louise's departure for a new convent, at Saint-Mandé on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, on the condition she go out only with the King Louis XIV's explicit permission and be attended by a chamberlain of his choice. Since she would not agree, her pension was suspended, only to be resumed when Louis XIV compelled her to yield.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It is worth noting <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E

30|$|Secondly, a point I {{would like}} to raise <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context,</b> is <b>that</b> the focus on {{practical}} purpose reduces the term technoscience to just another term for engineering and shifts the discussion towards the nexus of science, theory and engineering.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse {{engineering}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> means, <b>that</b> the UML tool reads program {{source code}} as input and derives model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as {{opposed to the}} somewhat broader meaning described in the article [...] "Reverse engineering").|$|R
25|$|However, the {{prospect}} of a conflict with the house of Austria offended a great part of the Catholics of France, notably the court.

25|$|The Secular Franciscan charism is {{not given}} to an {{individual}} person but {{to a group of}} brothers and sisters.

25|$|It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the 1987 America's Cup {{was seen}} as the best {{opportunity}} yet for a successful challenge, as the event was now outside the control of the NYYC and held in a location with strong but variable breezes, unlike the predictable and placid winds off Rhode Island. The regatta therefore attracted enormous additional interest over previous series.|$|E

25|$|It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} heir found himself nurtured in London, {{where he was}} to lead a miserable existence.

In 1593, he wrote in pathetic terms to the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, but the government really only had one use for him.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related to}} this, {{is the idea}} that art has The spiritual {{dimension}} and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The Theosophical Society popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China {{in the early years of}} the century. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.|$|E

The village progressively imposed its importance in the territory it belonged, which included diverse resources, a prolifieration of small agglomerations and agricultural parcels. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> in 1277, King Afonso III issued a charter to allow a fair in Ansiães.|$|E

The central government however reserves the first right to call on these battalions as and when required for deployment outside the state. The personnel of the battalion are engaged in both operational as well as law and order duties.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Malachi {{was written}} {{to correct the}} lax {{religious}} and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, {{it was not long}} after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{challenge to the}} department and its detectives during Seedman's tenure as chief was the Black Liberation Army (BLA). An offshoot of the Black Panthers who espoused a more militant and radical philosophy, they staged deadly ambushes on police officers in cities across the country. In New York their three attacks left four officers dead and two seriously wounded; in one, no suspects have ever been identified. After one of the attacks the BLA claimed responsibility, saying it was avenging the deaths of 19 prisoners in the Attica prison riots the previous year. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the incident that ended Seedman's police career occurred.|$|E
50|$|Gerard K. O'Neill {{proposed}} {{the use of}} storage rings as building blocks for a collider in 1956.

25|$|The Indian National Congress had conditionally {{supported}} the Allied war effort, and the Indian expatriate nationalists were concerned during this early phase {{that they might}} be seen as Quislings. This was particularly strong amongst members of the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge, which together with the IIL formed what was called the Indian National Council. Swami Satyananda Puri, a prominent member of the Lodge reportedly mentioned before the Tokyo conference that Nehru had forbidden Indians residing outside India from interfering in her internal politics. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> in a meeting in Singapore in March 1942, a unanimous decisions were taken to seek approval of the Indian National Congress for taking Japanese assistance, and to press for Subhash Chandra Bose to assume leadership of the movement.|$|E
25|$|He alternated {{between the}} Liberal (PNL) and Conservative (PC) parties in a vain {{search for the}} right {{conditions}} within which to achieve his democratic ideals. Along with other radicals of the period, his alternation was not due primarily to opportunism, but because the king recognized only the two main parties as legitimately able to form a government, and smaller parties were denied an effective role in public life. Although he frequently clashed with their leadership and despised their way of doing business, he hoped that by working from within, {{he would be able}} to secure at least some of his objectives. It is <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the militant of the 1880s moved to the Conservatives in the 1890s while preserving his core convictions. Additionally, he was unable to join the Liberals at that point because he believed they were too compromised by their long years in power, and had himself helped to overthrow them.|$|E
25|$|The Old English term Kent first {{appears in}} the Anglo-Saxon period, and {{was based on the}} earlier Celtic-language name Cantii. Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, {{by the end of the}} sixth century it also {{referred}} to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the Mill Hill cemetery was in use.|$|E
