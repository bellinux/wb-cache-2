5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its <b>first</b> <b>night</b> because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
