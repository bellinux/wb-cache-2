40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> Cacopsylla pyri (L.) (Homoptera: Psyllidae) – one of {{the main}} pest insects in pear {{production}} – is commonly controlled by spraying broad-spectrum insecticides, which may have serious side-effects on beneficial arthropods. Recently, a new approach to fruit pest management has arisen in the form of processed-kaolin particle film technology (product name Surround® WP). The white kaolin particle film repels insects without killing them. Therefore, side effects on beneficial arthropods are expected to be low. This new approach triggered the present study to control C. pyri. In spring 2003 a small-plot field trial was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} pre-flowering kaolin treatments on the first generation of C. pyri. Multiple applications of kaolin after the beginning of the flying period of C. pyri were compared with an untreated control and the standard organic insecticide rotenone. Kaolin significantly reduced the number of nymphs compared to the untreated control and showed a higher efficacy than rotenone, with the triple application of kaolin the most effective. Due to the high mobility of the adult C. pyri the effects on the summer population could not be assessed in this small-plot trial. Therefore, a large-plot trial was conducted in 2004. Again, kaolin showed a very high efficacy. At the end of June 2004 few C. pyri were noticed in the kaolin treated plot but, the population density tended to be lower than in the plot treated by a standard IPM strategy (Envidor®, Evisect® S). C. pyri was kept under the economic threshold until harvest. Since kaolin repels insects, its effect on beneficials are low, and therefore might be an alternative control strategy for C. pyri in organic and IPM orchards...|$|E

Rotenone, the only admitted product in Swiss organic agriculture, showed good effects. But, since Rotenone is toxic for non-target insects we looked for an alternative. The application of spinosad (Audienz) in combination with rape oil (Telmion) as well as the application of pyrethrum showed similar efficacy as rotenone. Neem had no or a very low impact on the <b>pear</b> <b>sucker</b> populations. The repellent kaolin (Surround® WP) showed the best efficacy against the <b>European</b> <b>pear</b> sucker: triple application of kaolin before blossom was most efficient. Since kaolin is not toxic for beneficials this product might be an alternative to rotenone...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pear</b> <b>suckers</b> (Cacopsylla sp. or pear psylla) {{are widely}} {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} pest in pear orchards. Sustainable control of pear psylla relies on their natural suppression by beneficial arthropods and a well-tuned integration of crop protection treatments. Predatory bugs (Anthocoris sp.) are efficient predators of <b>pear</b> <b>suckers,</b> playing a crucial role in the control of pear psylla summer generations. However, their poor presence early and late in the season and their high mobility makes it difficult for growers to build up persistent predatory bug populations in their orchards to efficiently control pear psylla the whole season. Therefore, we investigated alternative natural enemies which potentially play an important role in the suppression of pear psylla, especially during early spring and autumn. To this end, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in fourteen pear orchards, and comparing psylla as well as beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM pear orchards. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower pear psylla pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, in particularly velvet mite (Trombidiidae) and spider (Araneae) populations. In addition, predation of C. pyri was verified by PCR-based gut content analysis. The outcome was analyzed in light of different treatment schedules, providing insights in potential side-effects of crop protection treatments on the composition of beneficial fauna in pear orchards...|$|R

The study evaluated the graft compatibility for combinations of european Abbè Fetel, Rocha and Williams pear cultivars grafted onto the EMC quince rootstock. The experiment was performed in a commercial <b>european</b> <b>pear</b> orchard in the Urupema municipality, in State of Santa Catarina, during the 2011 / 12, 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14 growing seasons. The plant growth variables comprised the section increment (mm) in the trunk diameter in the graft union region of cultivars and rootstocks; difference in the diameter of the graft for cultivars and rootstocks; “translocated” incompatibility; “located” incompatibility and the vascular connection in the graft union region, which was assessed by immersing the bases of the plants in a 0. 08 % succinic acid solution. There were “located” and “translocated” incompatibility between the <b>european</b> Williams <b>pear</b> cultivar and the EMC rootstock based on the vascular discontinuity in the graft union region, which prevented the translocation of succinic acid stain.

40|$|Due to the gametophytic {{self-incompatibility}} of <b>European</b> <b>pear</b> (Pyrus communis), S-compatible cultivars that flower synchronically {{are required}} in commercial pear orchards to ensure effective pollination and fruit production.

40|$|We {{present a}} draft {{assembly}} of the genome of <b>European</b> <b>pear</b> (Pyrus communis) `Bartlett'. Our assembly was developed employing second generation sequencing technology (Roche 454), from single-end, 2 kb, and 7 kb insert paired-end reads using Newbler (version 2. 7). It contains 142, 083 scaffolds greater than 499 bases (maximum scaffold length of 1. 2 Mb) and covers a total of 577. 3 Mb, representing most of the expected 600 Mb Pyrus genome. A total of 829, 823 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected using re-sequencing of `Louise Bonne de Jersey' and `Old Home'. A total of 2, 279 genetically mapped SNP markers anchor 171 Mb of the assembled genome. Ab initio gene prediction combined with prediction based on homology searching detected 43, 419 putative gene models.
