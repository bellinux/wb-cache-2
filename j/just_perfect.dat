500|$|After two false {{starts from}} other skaters, Ohno won {{gold in the}} 500m {{when he took the}} lead with an {{explosive}} start and held it until the finish. [...] Despite criticism that he appeared to move before the start, a violation of the rules, the race start was validated by the officials. [...] Afterward, Ohno said, [...] "I was in the moment at the time. I thought I timed the start <b>just</b> <b>perfect.</b> The starter had been pretty quick all day, so that's why there were so many false starts at the beginning. But that was really good for me." ...|$|E

Hutton said that the pair was the most hostile that he faced during his career. Alan Davidson, a bowling all rounder who supported Lindwall and Miller for New South Wales and Australia, said that [...] "Ray Lindwall was the best bowler I ever saw of any type; his control was <b>just</b> <b>perfect.</b> At the other end you had Miller, who was unpredictable...It really was a perfect team." [...] He was an acrobatic slips fielder, who would take freakish catches with nonchalant ease, often immediately returning to his discussion with those around him as if nothing was unusual.|$|E

500|$|Bruce Campbell {{went through}} five {{audition}}s {{for the role}} of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, Campbell said, [...] "It's every actor's dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, where do I sign?" [...] He added that working on Brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell [...] "was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was <b>just</b> <b>perfect...</b> I can't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him." [...] Writing in Auxiliary Magazine, Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell's [...] "last great" [...] role before the actor fell into [...] "a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of Burn Notice".|$|E
500|$|St Hill {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{successful}} black batsmen in West Indies. As a batsmen, St Hill's performances reached their highest standards on the biggest occasions and against the best bowlers. Although not possessing quick footwork, he was capable of quickly judging where the ball would land. This enabled him to get into position quickly gave him extra time to play shots, which he often delayed until the ball was very close to him. Many of his runs were hit behind point and square leg. St Hill's favourite stroke was the leg glance; the shot carried the risk of falling leg before wicket (lbw) if he missed but his placement was very precise. He also played a range of cut shots. If a bowler restricted his scoring, St Hill improvised attacking shots to break free. Learie Constantine wrote a description of an innings he saw St Hill play as a young man. Facing the fast bowling of George John, St Hill [...] "flicked his wrists and the ball flew to the boundary faster than sound. The next went the same way. The boy batted from his wrists; he never seemed to use any force. I don't believe he had the strength even if he so desired. His was <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> timing." [...] However, he always insisted on playing his own style of game, whether he was in form or not. The result was often his dismissal without scoring many runs. This was the case in England in 1928. After 1926, St Hill was never the same batsman and according to James was as likely to get out cheaply as he was to make a big score.|$|E
2500|$|A {{great deal}} of the songs on the album were written over a two-year period by Love, Erlandson, and Schemel, in both Los Angeles as well as in a {{makeshift}} studio Love had set up at her and Cobain's secluded home in Carnation, Washington. Love also stated that [...] "half the fucking songs were written in the studio." [...] According to Love, the songwriting process for the album was [...] "really easy": [...] "We started at [...] Jabberjaw. I wrote [...] "Violet" [...] there. Then we moved to Seattle in the middle of that. [...] "Miss World" [...] was written in Seattle, if I remember correctly... We had this great rehearsal space : It was <b>just</b> <b>perfect,</b> up on Capitol Hill, near the Urban Outfitters. Everyone got really close. There was just a great flow." [...] Love also stated that she had been listening to The Breeders, Pixies, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Joy Division while recording the album, and that their work had acted as primary influences on her at the time.|$|E

Robin Williams was {{interested}} for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the [...] "all-British and Irish cast" [...] policy. Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start, responding [...] "RobbieColtraneforHagrid" [...] all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices. Coltrane was already a fan of the books and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was [...] "a fantastic thing." [...] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role. She also stated that [...] "Robbie is <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have – you really do have to sense – a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the harsh}} {{extremes}} in temperature on the Indian Subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role {{as well as}} a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the clothing of choice of air hostesses on Air India. This led to a professional style of draping a sari which is referred to [...] "Air-Hostess style sari". An air hostess style sari is tied in just the same way as a normal sari except that the pleats are held together quite nicely with the help of pins. A bordered sari will be <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> for an Air-Hostess style drape where the pallu is heavily pleated and pinned on the shoulder. Even the vertical pleats that are tucked at the navel are severely pleated and pressed. Same goes for the pallu pleats that are pinned at the shoulder. To get the perfect [...] "Air-hostess" [...] a complimentary U-shaped blouse that covers the upper body completely is worn which gives a very elegant and formal look. Mastering the [...] "Air-hostess" [...] style drape helps to create the desired impact in a formal setting like an interview or a conference.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky had befriended two {{linguists}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, {{the latter}} of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project, {{and the other half}} teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. He later described MIT as [...] "a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work." [...] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor. That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born, and he published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris–Bloomfield trend in the field. The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused [...] "significant upheaval" [...] in the discipline. Linguist John Lyons later asserted that it [...] "revolutionized the scientific study of language". From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we did the job. Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re {{going to try to}} do the same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> and was able to push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, so I think the strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by glancing at his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{suspected}} {{ulterior motives}} in the media's reaction, expressing, [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>perfect</b> timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, {{and it happened}} to me." [...] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, [...] "Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling {{to do anything about}} the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids." [...] Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, [...] "Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a [...] "sound bite attempt" [...] by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. [...] "When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be [...] "inappropriate" [...] that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. [...] "What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit. The Boston Legal episode [...] "Let Sales Ring" [...] likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, [...] "For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, [...] "It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant [...] "news", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else." ...|$|E
