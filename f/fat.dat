She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for <b>Fat</b> Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits <b>Fat</b> Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and <b>Fat</b> Tony spent together, seeing that <b>Fat</b> Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit <b>Fat</b> Tony and then simply <b>Fat</b> Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E

40|$|Saturated <b>fats</b> {{have been}} {{in the line of fire}} for more than three decades. The major mistake in {{understanding}} <b>fats</b> was to equate all saturated fatty acids as one. The oversimplification of the relationship of saturated <b>fats</b> with cardiovascular disease (CVD) led to unwarranted removal of some valuable <b>fats</b> from our diets. Recently, the relationship of dietary saturated <b>fats</b> and that of individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to CVD risk has been reevaluated. All saturated <b>fats</b> are not equal and these <b>fats</b> are not as bad as they are made out to be. Thus, not all SFAs in natural <b>fats</b> are atherogenic (formation of fatty deposits in arteries). Butter, clarified butter (desi ghee), coconut oil, and palm oil as a part of a healthy diet are not contraindicated. The review of literature clearly suggests a relook at saturated <b>fats</b> with respect to atherogenicity and over health...|$|R
