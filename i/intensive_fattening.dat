40|$|Fattening {{of cattle}} based on high-grain diets {{is the most}} {{intensive}} form of beef production. Although cattle are ruminants specialised in fodder utilisation, such effective systems of young cattle nutrition exist that resemble – by a high grain pro-portion – the fattening of non-ruminant animals. They are used most frequently for the fattening of lower slaughter weight categories of cattle (250 to 450 kg), i. e. {{for the production of}} so called baby beef. Many authors dealt with cattle fattening by the baby beef method, with 80 % grain proportion of dry matter in the diet (Krása et al., 1995; Chládek et al., 1998; Pinďák and Vrchlabský, 2000).

The system boundaries were set from the calves' birth to their sale to the slaughterhouse, including the herd management, on- and off-farm feed production and materials used on the farms. One kilogram of body weight (BW) sold {{was used as the}} functional unit. The study involved 73 Charolais batches (i. e., a group of animals homogenous for age, finishing period and fattening farm), kept at 14 Italian farms. Data from 40 farms originating from the Charolais Network database (INRA) were used to characterize the French farm types, which were matched to the fattening batches according to the results of a cluster analysis. The impact categories assessed were as follows (mean +/- SD per kg BW) : global warming potential (GWP, 13. 0 +/- 0. 7 kg CO 2 -eq, reduced to 9. 9 +/- 0. 7 kg CO 2 -eq when considering the carbon sequestration due to French suckler cow-calf system permanent grassland), acidification potential (AP, 193 +/- 13 g SO 2 -eq), eutrophication potential (EP, 57 +/- 4 g PO 4 -eq), cumulative energy demand (CED, 36 +/- 5 MJ), and land occupation (LO, 18. 7 +/- 0. 8 m(2) /year). The on-farm impacts outweighed those of the off-farm activities, except in the case of CED. On average, 41 MJ and 16. 7 kg of dietary feed gross energy and protein were required to provide 1 MJ or 1 kg of protein of raw boneless beef, respectively, but nearly 85 % and 80 %, respectively, were derived from feedstuffs not suitable for human consumption. Emission-related (GWP, AP, EP) and resource utilization categories (CED, LO) were positively correlated. Food-related indicators showed positive correlations with emission-related indicators when the overall feedstuffs of the diet were considered but negative correlations when only the potentially human-edible portions of the beef diets were considered. In conclusion, the integration of the pasture-based France suckler cow-calf system with the cereal-based Italian fattening farms allows for the exploitation of the resources available, increasing the share of non-human-edible feedstuffs while maintaining good livestock productive efficiency. Combining indicators of impact categories with indicators of feed net supply may improve the assessment of the environmental footprint of livestock systems...|$|R

The measured parameters were temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), air speed, airflow, total dust, noxious gases (NH 3, CO 2, CH 4, H 2 S), airborne bacteria and fungi. In relation to environmental parameters, T, RH and airflow were subjected to wide and rapid fluctuations during summer, autumn and spring. The highest levels of RH were measured under summer conditions, due to the evaporative cooling system activation. The highest NH 3 and CO 2 concentrations occurred in concurrence with minimum airflow rates (i. e. cold season, night-time, early hours). CH 4 concentrations were highest in summer, whereas H 2 S concentrations showed some peaks when manure scrapers were in operation. Total dust levels were higher during autumn and winter, when minimum ventilation levels occurred. As regards hygienic parameters, P. multocida seemed influenced by seasonal conditions, probably due to wide and rapid fluctuations in T, RH and airflow {{as well as to}} high RH levels, showing an increasing trend from spring to autumn. The dermatophyte M. canis showed the highest concentrations in correspondence with minimum airflow rates (i. e. winter).

The methodology was descriptive method with trend analysis in accordance with competitiveness, technical and financial aspects. The data were collected from local feedlotter, related and supporting industries, as well as central, province and district governments and related institutions in Balikpapan and East Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara, South Sulawesi, DKI Jakarta and Bogor. In competitiveness aspects, the diamond diagram in the Complete System (Porter, 1990) were used to analyze the data. The domestic demand of live cows was very big such as 36 cows/day in Balikpapan and 279 cows/day in East Kalimantan compared with supply of 24 cows/day only three competitors existed; mean while the cow fatteninglproduction factors, related and supporting industries as well as government factors were able to achieve and to increase business chances /opportunities concurrently; therefore the competitiveness aspects were feasible. In technical aspects, the calf, feeding and watering procurement management as well as cow fattening management cumulatively and synergically were cow fattening/productions factors, that were able to be performed with simple technology by available local workers in East Kalimantan; therefore the technical aspects were feasible.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, ewes of “Merinolandschaf”, a breed {{widespread}} in southern Germany, were crossed with rams of five meat breed types (Ile de France, Charollais, German black-headed mutton sheep (Deutsches Schwarzköpfiges Fleischschaf), Suffolk, Texel) and Merinolandschaf rams. The resulting lambs (179 individu-als) were fattened intensively from 55. 3 days and body weight of 20. 4 kg until 121. 7 days and a weight of 40. 9 kg. While fattening, feed intake was recorded and lambs were weighed weekly. Ile de France×Merinolandschaf and Texel×Merinolandschaf {{seem to be}} of greatest economic interest for <b>intensive</b> <b>fattening</b> because they showed the best feed conversion rate and energetic feed conversion rate. Only these crosses were significantly superior compared to purebred Merinolandschaf in feed conversion rate and also in daily body weight gain during the fattening period. Except Charollais×Merinolandschaf, all crosses showed at least a tendency of improvement in all three traits compared to Merinolandschaf, although {{this is not always}} significant. This underlines the ad-vantage of one-way cross-breeding for efficiently producing lamb meat. The growth was modelled with a linear model and the Gompertz model. The results showed that both models fit the data well, although the average R 2 was slightly higher and the average mean square error was slightly lower for the Gompertz model. In addition, the use of the Gompertz model provided some interesting biological insights concerning the growth of lambs and differences between the crosses, even though the lambs were slaughtered before reaching their mature body weight. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>intensive</b> <b>fattening</b> of bulls with a high-grain diet on selected health parameters. Metabolic indicators under study were compared with those in bulls receiving a traditional diet based on maize silage. The trial included 18 Czech pied bulls that were fed a diet containing from 75. 0 % to 83. 6 % concentrate on dry matter basis. As a control, 18 Czech pied bulls were used, given total mixed ration based on maize silage. The experiment was started after weaning when the treated group averaged 114 days of age and the control group 115 days of age. Bulls were slaughtered at an average age of 473 days in the treated group and 474 days in the control group. The experiment lasted 359 days. In the fattening period, blood and rumen fluid samples were withdrawn to evaluate rumen fermentation, acid-base balance and selected biochemical indicators. After the slaughter, samples of tuber coxae cancellous tissue were collected for the bone metabolism assessment. Among indicators under study, the rumen fermentation ones were the most affected by feeding the high-grain diet. Bulls fed the high-grain diet showed (P ≤ 0. 05) lower rumen fluid pH and a higher total titration activity, a higher (P ≤ 0. 01) total level of VFA and propionate proportion, and a lower (P ≤ 0. 01) acetate proportion than the control bulls. Counts of infusoria were also lower (P ≤ 0. 01). Acid-base balance was no...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} {{of the impact of}} selected measures of government reforms in the beef market in the Czech Republic. The selected measures of government reforms are defined and specified on the base of available resources in the introduction. Subsequently, these measures are simulated by the model of partial equilibrium of defined market in the practical part. The impacts of the measures on both supply and demand of selected market are then commented, based on formal econometric quantification and verification of model outputs. The analyzed government measures are included {{in the form of an}} expected increase in VAT, the movement of the Czech crown, the development of consumer income and the price expectancy in vertical of beef. The results predict negative consequences on domestic market, in particular on the supply side, in the form of a relatively significant reduction in the number of pieces of cattle. These can result in reducing the number of enterprises with <b>intensive</b> <b>fattening</b> or in shifting their focus to other commodities of vegetable nature. On the demand side, the analyzed measures are likely to bring short-term price reductions. However, the steep growth accompanied by a reduction in quality of meat products can be reasonable expected in the long run.

The examination was done in a production farm for <b>intensive</b> <b>fattening</b> of broilers in R. Macedonia. Broilers from genotype Hubbard Classic and Cobb 500, 2400 one-day chickens all together sorted out in 16 separated and marked boxes have been used as a material. In each box were put 150 chickens, which contained four different treatments (two different hybrids x two diets) and four repetitions in one turns. Starter mixture was used during I-II weeks, grower for III weeks, then finisher 1 from IV-VI week, and finisher 2 for VII weeks of broilers fattening. Chemical structure of the first mixture (diet 1) had higher level of energy and proportion E:P, while the second mixture had higher level of proteins and lower values of proportion E:P. During the fattening the production parameters of the examining chickens: body mass, daily gain, feed consumption, and conversions were regularly observed. All data have been processed by computer subprogram Basic Statistic and Anova. Chickens, which were fed with the first mixture 1, had higher body mass between the period of II-VII week than the chickens fed with the second mixture and these differences were statistically significant. Total feed consumption and mostly per week was insignificantly bigger at the chickens from the genotype Hubbard in the proportion with the feed consumption of the chickens Cobb. The effect of the various substances (energetic-protein) was insignificant at the feed consumption, but significant (p< 0, 05) at the feed conversion...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on suckler cows breeding. Literary review and further details {{are focused on the}} development and application of four selected beef breeds of British origin in terms of cattle breeding in the Czech Republic. 	In the introduction I would like to describe mainly the origin and domestication of cattle. Much of the work is also devoted to meat production, its control and eventually classification and monetising the final product according to a single system SEUROP applicable in countries European Union. In this chapter were simultaneously described factors of the most important facts affecting meat performance that affects the overall results of the breed, including its profitability. 	 The second half of the thesis summarizes the basics of cattle breeding, organization during the calendar year and grazing. There is an idea of reproduction, calving and basic measures during rearing and weaning calves. In other chapters, are explained the circumstances of the development of animal husbandry and the current status of beef breeds in the country. Also described are two basic systems of breeding beef cattle, it is a system of <b>intensive</b> <b>fattening</b> and breeding no milked cattle under extensive conditions, which are characterized in detail in a separate chapter. 	In the last chapters are presented in detail four selected meat breeds originating from the British Isles, which are in our conditions most frequently raised and used for extensive breeding system no milked cattle. There is also magnified view of history. It contains breeding these selected breeds, including the identification numbers of the development from the beginning to the present. 	Besides to the detailed characteristics of these selected meat breeds and their descriptions are shown and summarized like the results of performance within the CHECKS performance of beef cattle. For each breed they are processed mainly results concerning the weight of calves in individual sections and their rearing till 365 days of age, in addition, depending on gender. 	At the end, there are mentioned criteria of selection program, breeding goals and standard of these four selected meat breeds of British origin...|$|E
