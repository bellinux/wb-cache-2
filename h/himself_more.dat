5|$|Starting with Rashomon, Kurosawa's {{productions}} {{had become}} increasingly large {{in scope and}} so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as majority shareholder.|$|E
5|$|The natives' {{resistance}} to conversion bothered Lapsley more than Sheppard, as Sheppard viewed <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> as an explorer than a missionary. While Lapsley {{was on a}} trip to visit fellow missionary–explorer George Grenfell, Sheppard became familiar with the natives' hunting techniques and language. He even helped to avert a famine by slaying thirty-six hippos. Sheppard contracted malaria 22 times in his first 2 years in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 is on {{the north}} side of StructureA-3. It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, {{although}} his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek' of Motul. Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also the patrons of Palenque. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> closely with the city he came to rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|Using his wealth, Lilly {{engaged in}} {{numerous}} philanthropic pursuits. He {{turned over the}} management of the company to his son, Josiah K. Lilly, Sr., around 1890 to allow <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> time to continue his involvement in charitable organizations and civic advancement. Colonel Lilly helped found the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and became the primary patron of Indiana's branch of the Charity Organization Society. He personally funded a children's hospital in Indianapolis, known as Eleanor Hospital (closed in 1909). Lilly continued his active involvement with many other organizations until his death from cancer in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Aston {{was born}} on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys. He {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at Oldbury Grammar School attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it. His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes playing truant to do so. The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the University of Birmingham, albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967. He taught <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> about archaeology by enrolling in various excavations, and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, {{as well as the}} geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists Philip Rahtz and Philip Barker. His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West Penwith peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Bell was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} opening match of the 1904–05 season, a 1–4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield, but was dropped for the trip to Bolton Wanderers in favour of youngster William Hutchinson, a summer signing from non-League club Alston. He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904, deputising for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane, but then spent more than two months out of the team. Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season, playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905. He found <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> involved in the first-team during the 1905–06 campaign, making 19 league appearances. On 13 January 1906, he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round. Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906, netting the opening goal in the 2–2 draw against Burslem Port Vale. During March 1906, he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed {{to make a good}} recovery, and he felt up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E
5|$|In August, Khánh gave <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> powers, {{provoking}} widespread {{riots and}} demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns {{at a time when}} many teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The season {{came down}} to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> apt than his peers {{to bring in a}} relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox {{the rest of the way}} as the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.|$|E

5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on his own. In 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing, which he considered the artistic process, while the inking was more of a craft.|$|E
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resumption, Crapp {{began to}} accelerate, hitting a six—which flew {{directly}} {{back over the}} bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was {{a stark contrast to}} Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow <b>himself</b> <b>more</b> time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.|$|E
