50|$|Dead Ends {{had several}} line-up changes but {{brothers}} Al (on vocals and guitar) and Jay (on bass) remained as {{the nucleus of}} <b>the</b> <b>band</b> through <b>the</b> years. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> had three drummers: Rouen Pascual (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> first two albums, Complaints and Second Coming), Harley Alarcon (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> third album Damned Nation) and Bong Montojo (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> fourth album Mamatay sa Ingay with guitarist Lourd de Veyra).|$|R

5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background information <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> {{was that they}} signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States {{because he had a}} criminal record in his home country.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|Although all but Jonny {{had left}} Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, On a Friday {{continued}} to rehearse {{on weekends and}} holidays.

5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would {{want them to}} carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.|$|E
5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
50|$|Kris McCaddon was <b>the</b> {{original}} guitarist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> metalcore <b>band,</b> Society's Finest {{and lead}} guitarist for Demon Hunter. He was also <b>the</b> vocalist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bands</b> Embodyment and <b>The</b> Famine.|$|R

5|$|Dave Finnegan {{was cast}} as Mickah Wallace, a belligerent and hot-tempered bouncer {{who becomes a}} drummer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> Parker's first meeting with Finnegan began civilly before their exchanges grew more and more heated. They soon became {{verbally}} abusive, threatening each other with disturbing acts of violence. Parker cast Finnegan immediately, explaining that he simply wanted to test the limits of Finnegan's aggression, as he wanted the truculence of the character to be convincing. Colm Meaney first learned of the film adaptation while working with Parker on Come See the Paradise. After Parker held auditions for the younger cast members, Meaney secured the role of Jimmy's father Jimmy Rabbitte, Sr. The audition scene in the film, in which various musicians audition at Jimmy Rabbitte's home, required more than 100 band members. Peter Rowen, brother of Irish artist Guggi, appears as a young skateboarding boy who asks to audition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> At {{the time of the}} film's production, Rowen had appeared on the cover art of U2's albums Boy (1980) and War (1983), and was a national skating champion.|$|E

5|$|Following the lukewarm {{response}} to the band's previous album, 2013's Super Collider, Dystopia received largely favorable reaction from critics, being considered a return to form <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> The album holds a Metacritic score of 69/100 as of August 2016. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, making Dystopia the band's second highest charting album in the U.S. after Countdown to Extinction, which peaked at number two in 1992.

5|$|In April 2001, Rise Against {{released}} {{their debut}} studio album The Unraveling through Fat Wreck Chords. Although the album {{failed to reach}} any major music charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, and helped establish a steady fanbase <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> After the release of The Unraveling, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal differences with lead vocalist Tim McIlrath; he was eventually replaced by Todd Mohney, McIlrath's roommate and former bandmate.|$|E
5|$|In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn {{formed a}} country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later {{a member of}} The Bottle Rockets). Henneman {{impressed}} Uncle Tupelo, and {{he was invited to}} be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn {{began their}} musical {{careers in the}} 1980s playing in a garage band, The Plebes. After a few gigs, {{creative}} differences between the members {{led to the development}} of a punk rock sound <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> As punk rock was unpopular in the St. Louis region, the band changed their style to blues-rock and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this point, they stopped performing covers and began to write their own songs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>band</b> {{was founded}} in 2004 as Cabincrew by two former members of <b>the</b> <b>band</b> Killer - Timo Huhtala and Teijo Jämsä - and Samuli Relander who used to play guitar <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bands</b> <b>The</b> Winyls and Personal Aspect.|$|R

Gretz announced his return to drumming <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> Zao, {{and is a member}} of Emanuel and the Fear.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was a chance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover {{a wide array of}} topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, {{originally}} directly <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Coasters. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> recerded it in at the same recordinmg session as [...] "Little Egypt".
