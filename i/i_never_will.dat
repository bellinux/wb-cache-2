500|$|Filmmakers, {{crew members}} and co-stars {{tend to agree}} that Pfeiffer is {{extremely}} [...] "committed" [...] to her work, developing a [...] "reputation for competence, control, and hyper-preparation". At times Pfeiffer {{has been described as}} difficult to work with, particularly by Robert Towne, who directed her in Tequila Sunrise; Towne famously dubbed Pfeiffer [...] "the most difficult actress in Hollywood". On this designation, Pfeiffer admitted that she can seem difficult at times but it mostly [...] "depends on whom you talk to." [...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that {{there was a time when}} attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>will</b> – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to scrunch her face and narrow her eyes before responding to questions. Pfeiffer always discards old scripts in which she has written extensive notes about her characters, nor does she retain film reviews, magazine clippings or covers about her work or performances.|$|E

Soon afterwards, however, Emilia brings Iago's treachery to light, and Iago kills {{her in a}} fit of rage before being arrested. He remains famously reticent when pressed for an explanation of his actions before he is arrested: [...] "Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.
