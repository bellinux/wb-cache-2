500|$|Cameron {{moved from}} Winnipeg to Edmonton in 1881 by ox-cart, {{travelling}} through Carlton and Battleford, bringing with him [...] of freight {{on a journey}} that took three months. Once in Edmonton, he used this freight as the <b>initial</b> <b>inventory</b> of a store, the A. McDonald Company, where he entered into a partnership. In 1891, he would purchase the store from its original owner, A. McDonald. He {{moved into a new}} building in 1893, designed by architect William S. Edmiston and constructed by contractor Kenneth McLeod. The building, located on Jasper Avenue, included a cellar, main floor for merchandise and storage, and an upper storey, heated in its entirety by a furnace. He would operate until 1896. After the sale of the store, he entered into the real estate and coal business. In 1914, Cameron was serving as managing director and treasurer of Gainford Colleries Ltd. and as chairman of the provisional directors of the Canada Northwest Loan and Mortgage Company.|$|E

Capitalized at only $3,000 including its <b>initial</b> <b>inventory,</b> the prototype economy store operated with only a manager, and without fancy fixtures. Within two months, weekly sales increased to $800 and the store achieved a 30% annual return on investment. A quickly expanded the concept; by 1915 the chain operated 1,600 stores. A's tremendous growth created problems with suppliers. Cream of Wheat was the largest breakfast food manufacturer; it demanded that all retailers adhere to the cereal's pricing per box. A purchased the product at wholesale, 11 cents per box (3 cents less), and decided that a 1-cent mark-up was appropriate for its economy store format. Cream of Wheat cut off supplies and A sued. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Hough ruled against A, saying that a manufacturer can establish retail prices. As a result, A and other large chains significantly expanded manufacturing private brands.|$|E

Neiman, then employees of Sanger Brothers competitor A. Harris and Co. In 1907 the trio found themselves with $25,000 from the successful sales-promotion firm they had built in Atlanta, Georgia, and two potential investments into which to invest the funds. [...] Rather than {{take a chance on}} an unknown [...] "sugary soda pop business", the three entrepreneurs rejected the fledgling Coca-Cola company and chose instead to return to Dallas to found a retail business. [...] For this reason, early company CEO Peb Atera was quoted in 1957 as saying in jest that Neiman Marcus was [...] "founded on bad business judgment". The store, established on September 10, 1907, was lavishly furnished and stocked with clothing of a quality not commonly found in Texas. Within a few weeks, the store's <b>initial</b> <b>inventory,</b> mostly acquired on a buying trip to New York made by Carrie, was completely sold out. Oil-rich Texans, welcoming the opportunity to flaunt their wealth in more sophisticated fashion than was previously possible, flocked to the new store. In spite of the Panic of 1907 set off only a few weeks after its opening, Neiman Marcus was instantly successful, and its first several years of operation were quite profitable.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A good {{initiative}} {{for creating a}} national database of inland wetlands is identifying possible locations for these water bodies. Four procedures in the detection of water bodies were tested using Landsat TM Imagery and were evaluated to determine which procedure best serves the purpose of efficiently creating an <b>initial</b> wetland <b>inventory</b> for the Philippines. The procedures are namely: classification using Perceptron Model, supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood, unsupervised classification using Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), and classification by thresholding. All four procedures detected major wetlands including lakes and dams, and they also detected areas that are considerably wet such as swamps, fishponds, and agricultural areas. Due to the limited resolution of Landsat TM, small and narrow wetlands {{were not included in}} the <b>initial</b> wetland <b>inventory.</b> Considering speed and visual accuracy, classification by thresholding was chosen as the best method to use in creating the <b>initial</b> wetland <b>inventory.</b> The procedure also requires minor supervision from user and therefore minimizes errors coming from the user. As an accuracy check, wetland point locations obtained from the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) were used as reference to validate the created wetland inventory. Out of the 27 wetlands in the database of BMB that lie on the study area, at least 24 wetlands were delineated in the inventory. Upon creating the <b>initial</b> wetland <b>inventory,</b> this will be used to evaluate identified areas for a detailed delineation of wetlands using an established method using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) ...|$|R

We develop a mixed integer program for this situation. Two case studies based on Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey are developed and solved in CPLEX.

40|$|Abstract. Oligopolistic {{retailers}} {{decide on}} the <b>initial</b> <b>inventories</b> of an undifferentiated limited-lifetime product offered to strategic consumers. A manufacturer sets the first-period (full) price, while the second-period (clearance) price is determined by a market clearing process. The resulting symmetric pure-strategy equilibria may lead to no sales in {{the first or second}} period (Cournot outcome versus collusion), and sales in both periods with the clearance price above or at the salvage value. The equilibria possess a comprehensive set of monotonic properties. In particular, increasing strategic behavior can benefit retailers, hurt consumers, push a high-cost retailer out of the market, and lead to increasing inventory of a low-cost retailer. Increasing competition may harm the local economy, and high levels of strategic behavior may insure against oversupply that leads to clearance sales at the salvage value. The welfare-optimal number of retailers can lead to the above-cost clearance price...|$|R

40|$|We study a multi-item capacitated lot-sizing {{problem with}} setup times and pricing (CLSTP) over a finite and {{discrete}} planning horizon. In {{this class of}} problems, the demand for each independent item in each time period is affected by pricing decisions. The corresponding demands are then satisfied through production in a single capacitated facility or from inventory, and {{the goal is to}} set prices and determine a production plan that maximizes total profit. In contrast with many traditional lot-sizing problems with fixed demands, we cannot, without loss of generality, restrict ourselves to instances without <b>initial</b> <b>inventories,</b> which greatly complicates the analysis of the CLSTP. We develop two alternative Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition formulations of the problem, and propose to solve their relaxations using column generation and the overall problem using branch-and-price.
