5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared {{far worse}} than <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below the}} 1% mark. However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming out ahead of his closest rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%. In a head-to-head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day, Tancredo finished with 31% to 48% for Obama.|$|E

30|$|Wheat straw is an {{agricultural}} waste {{which can be}} used as a cost effective animal feed. However, high hemicellulose and phytic acid content <b>in</b> wheat <b>straw</b> prevents it as a primary feed choice. Utilization of wheat <b>straw</b> <b>in</b> solid-state fermentation may result <b>in</b> wheat <b>straw</b> valorization and enzyme production. In this study, phytase production in solid-state fermentation of wheat straw using Aspergillus ficuum and valorization of wheat straw were evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Samples {{of straw}} from two {{varieties}} of rice, namely MR 211 and MR 219 which were grown at five levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 120, 160, 200 and 240 kg N ha - 1) were collected at harvesting time (MR 211 at 105 DAS; MR 219 at 115 DAS). The straws were separated into leaf (including blade and sheath) and stem fractions and were analyzed for chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. Increases {{in the level}} of nitrogen fertilization were found to increase the Crude Protein (CP) <b>in</b> whole <b>straw</b> (p 0. 05) by the nitrogen fertilization level. There were varietal differences <b>in</b> the <b>straw</b> chemical composition, where variety MR 219 had higher NDF, hemicellulose and cellulose (p< 0. 05) concentration where as variety MR 211 had higher amount of ADL (p< 0. 01) and silica (p< 0. 05) <b>in</b> the <b>straw.</b> There were no differences between the varieties <b>in</b> the <b>straw</b> CP, ADF, ash and digestibility. Between the two varieties, MR 219 variety is superior to MR 211 in view of the higher grain production and grain: straw ratio. The result from correlation between agronomic characteristics and straw nutritive quality implies that rice varieties with good agronomic characteristics have potential <b>in</b> yielding <b>straws</b> with better nutritive quality. The result showed that increasing nitrogen fertilization rate could overcome the problem of low protein <b>in</b> rice <b>straw</b> for animal feed...|$|R
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{beginning in}} the Precucuteni III period (circa 4800-4600 BC), special communal sanctuary buildings {{began to appear in}} Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. They continued to exist during the Cucuteni A and Cucuteni A/B (corresponding to Trypillia B) periods (circa 4600-3800 BC), but then for some reason these sanctuaries began to disappear, until in the Cucuteni B (Trypillia C) period (circa 3800-3500 BC) only a few examples have been discovered from archaeological exploration. These sanctuaries were constructed in a monumental style architecture, and included stelae, statues, shrines, and numerous other ceremonial and religious artifacts, sometimes packed <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> inside pottery.|$|E

About 1750, he married Shirley Stirling, daughter of the Presbyterian minister from Walworth, Ballykelly. They had a daughter Mary, called Polly, born about 1752. Shirley most likely died in childbirth, as Polly was raised by her uncle, Samuel Haslet and followed her father to America in 1765.|$|E

2500|$|Another theme {{exhibited}} in this hall is autosacrifice, a ritual that {{was conducted in}} private as a personal act of communication with the gods. Widespread throughout the entire population, this practice was performed by perforating certain fleshy parts of the body—such as the earlobes, lips, tongue, chest, calves, et cetera—with obsidian blades, agave needles or bone perforators. Once the implement was covered with blood, it was inserted <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> balls called Zacatapayoli. The entirety was probably placed in ceremonial boxes—tepetlacalli—as an offering to the gods. Objects associated with human sacrifice are the [...] "face blades" [...] or knives decorated with eyes and teeth, as well as skull [...] masks.

2500|$|Frame {{structures}} were built on piers {{to keep the}} air circulating across the area's damp soil, while brick structures had a root cellar with a drainage tunnel. Inside, Harmonists built fireplaces {{to the left or}} right of center to allow for a long center beam, adding strength to support the structure and its heavy, shingled roof. [...] "Dutch biscuits" [...] (wood laths wrapped <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> and mud) provided insulation and soundproofing between the ceiling and floors. The exterior was insulated with bricks between the exterior's unpainted weatherboards and the interior's lath and plaster walls. Structures had standard parts and pre-cut, pre-measured timbers, which were assembled on the ground, adjusted to fit on site, raised in place, and locked into place with pegs and mortise and tenon joints. Two-story floor plans for homes included a large living room, kitchen, and entrance hall, with stairs to the second floor and attic. In Indiana, Harmonists did their baking in communal ovens, so stoves could be substituted for fireplaces.|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, 2012, {{he was a}} {{guest on}} the Opie and Anthony radio show.

2500|$|In 1941 {{during the}} run-up to American {{involvement}} in World WarII, President Roosevelt appointed La Guardia first {{director of the new}} Office of Civilian Defense (OCD). Roosevelt was an admirer of La Guardia; after meeting Winston Churchill {{for the first time he}} described him as [...] "an English Mayor La Guardia". The OCD was the national agency responsible for preparing for blackouts, air raid wardens, sirens, and shelters in case of German air raids. The government knew that such air raids were impossible but the goal was to psychologically mobilize many thousands of middle class volunteers to make them feel part of the war effort. La Guardia remained Mayor of New York, shuttling back and forth with three days in Washington and four in the city in an effort to do justice to two herculean jobs. On top of this, he still performed other gestures, such as arranging police protection with his personal assurances for local artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, when they were threatened by Nazi supporters for their new patriotic comic book superhero, Captain America. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, his role was turned over to full-time director of OCD, James M. Landis. La Guardia's popularity slipped away and he ran so poorly <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> polls in 1945 that he did not run for a fourth term.|$|E
