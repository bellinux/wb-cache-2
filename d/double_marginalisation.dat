40|$|Building upon a multiple-product channel structure, {{this paper}} {{develops}} {{a model to}} test channel price leadership {{on the basis of}} time series observations on retail and wholesale prices and using absence of <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> as a criterion for channel price leadership. The model studies strategic pricing decisions in a two-stage (suppliers–retailers) channel, dealing with several products. Possible long-run relationships between wholesale and retail prices are investigated in relation to three cases. Case 1 : suppliers have sufficient power vis-à-vis retailers to enforce double marginalisation; Case 2 : retailers do not allow suppliers to enforce double marginalisation; and Case 3 : one retailer not only keeps its suppliers from <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> but is also the horizontal price leader vis-à-vis competing retailers. We explicitly take the time series properties into account to derive the testable implications of strategic price interactions in marketing channels. An attractive feature of our methodology is that price leadership can be tested on the basis of time series on retail prices and wholesale prices only. The procedure for testing the long-run causality implications of the model uses the definition of long-run causality as formulated by Bruneau and Jondeau [Oxf. Bull. Econ. Stat. 61 (4) (1999) 545], but does not use their Wald statistic, which suffers from the undesirable properties of the Wald test when there are nonlinear parameter restrictions. To interpret restrictions on the common stochastic trends of retail and wholesale prices, we show that the common stochastic trends and the deviations from the long-run equilibriums must explicitly be assigned to variables in the channel model. If a common stochastic trend consists of both the retail price and the wholesale price of a product, then the suppliers are able to enforce <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> vis-à-vis the retailers (Case 1). If a common stochastic trend consists solely of a product's wholesale price, then the retailers do not allow suppliers to enforce <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> (Case 2). The opposite situation is a common stochastic trend consisting solely of a product's retail price. In this situation, one of the retailers not only keeps its suppliers from <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> but is also the horizontal price leader in the retail market for the product (Case 3). The model is applied to a typical multiple product channel allowing various vertical and horizontal interactions between the channel members to co-occur...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the welfare}} effects of vertical {{integration of networks}} and trade in energy markets. Vertical integration reduces the effect of <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> thus increasing welfare. On the other hand, vertical integration hinders equal competition, rendering the vertically integrated supplier a competitive advantage. We find that {{the net effect of}} vertical integration is beneficial to welfare if firms are symmetric, but the effect is ambiguous in the probably more relevant situation where the non-network firm has a cost advantage. ...|$|E

By means of expert interviews, we verify whether the counter-logics of platform ecosystems and the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> effect of double platform markets pertain to the Flemish audiovisual media industry.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility for}} two vertically related firms to at least partially collude on the wholesale price over an infinite horizon to mitigate or eliminate the effects of <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> thereby avoiding contracts which might not be enforceable. We characterise alternative scenarios envisaging different deviations by the upstream firm and different punishments. This allows us {{to show that the}} most efficient case is that in which the upstream firm deviates along its best reply function and the punishment prescribes the disruption of the vertical relation for good after a deviation from the collusive path...|$|E
40|$|It is {{believed}} that market power of the input supplier, charging a linear price, is detrimental for the consumers since it creates the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> problem. We show that this view {{may not be true}} if the final goods producers can adopt strategies to reduce rent extraction by the input supplier. Market power of the input supplier may encourage a final goods producer either to license its technology to a competitor or to adopt a less distortionary technology licensing contract. Both these effects may create higher consumer welfare under market power of the input supplier compared to a competitive input market...|$|E
40|$|This paper first {{studies the}} {{determination}} of final consumer price when two successive monopolists bargain over the intermediate goods price. Unlike the conventional <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> result which rests on the (implicit) assumption that the upstream firm has all the bargaining power, it is shown that, as the bargaining power shifts from downstream firm to upstream firm, the equilibrium quantity (price) decreases (increases) continuously from the vertically integrated outcome to the conventional double marginalization outcome. This paper next studies {{the determination of}} retail and wholesale prices in successive Cournot oligopolies and generalizes the results of Bresnahan and Reiss (1985) on the ratio of retail to wholesale margins in successive monopolies.

The particuarity of these migrations, based on usage of ethnic origin and dual citizenship is demonstrated. The author discusses the outcomes of these migrations both for the migrants as well as the sending communities. She draws attention to the phenomenon of <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation,</b> taking place in the sending region as well as the receiving one. In the analysis, a number of complementary theoretical perspectives are applied: dual labour market theory, transnational social spaces theory, the theory of globalisation of migration and the periferies. A typology of migration, based on the strategies most often used by the migrants, is also drawn...|$|E
40|$|Prior to digitalisation, the {{vertical}} {{structure of the}} market for recorded music could be described as a large number of artists [composers, lyricists and musicians] supplying creative expressions to a small number of larger record labels and publishers who funded, produced, and marketed the resulting recorded music to subsequently sell these works to consumers through a fragmented retail sector. We argue that digitalisation has led to a new structure in which the retail segment has also become concentrated. Such a structure, with successive oligopolistic segments, can lead to higher consumer prices through <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation.</b> We further question whether a combination of disintermediation of the record labels function combined with “self-publishing” by artists, will lead to the demise of powerful firms in the record label segment, thus shifting market power from the record label and publisher segment to the retail segment, rather than increasing the number of segments with market power...|$|E
40|$|Patent {{pools of}} {{complementary}} technologies {{are known to}} contribute to social welfare by reducing the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> problem. However, when there are vertically integrated firms that engage in both R&D and production and research laboratories that engage only in R&D, the latter have less incentives to join the patent pool. Using a simple three-stage, three-firm model including the investment stage of an industry where production requires technologies of all the firms, this paper shows that requiring the research laboratory to join the pool may increase total surplus by allowing the vertically-integrated firms to invest more in R&D even though the research laboratory’s incentives are reduced. When the function relating the investment and the probability of successful invention is common among the three firms, the above requirement raises total surplus, {{in contrast to the}} previous literature which emphasises the adverse impact on the research laboratories ’ incentives to invest...|$|E

In sub-Saharan Africa, where opportunities for higher education are especially limited, women are unlikely to continue their education. This research investigates women in Tanzanian higher education with the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> of being a woman and having disabilities. The women were interviewed on what factors enabled access and participation for their educational success. A thematic analysis of qualitative data was applied. All of the women interviewed were motivated to complete their degrees. Key enabling factors were encouragement from their families and previous teachers, full participation in student life and sufficient financial support. Student life integration, especially peer study groups, and university staff training were emphasised along with structural modifications needed for campus facility access. They understood the importance of education, especially as women with disabilities, and the impact educated women with disabilities have as role models for young women, those with disabilities and without...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the incentives}} to upgrade input quality in vertically related (network) industries. Upstream investments have a biased {{effect on the}} downstream companies and lead to vertical product differentiation. Different vertical structures such as vertical integration, ownership and legal unbundling lead to different investments. We find that, without regulation, vertical integration and legal unbundling regimes provide highest investment incentives and lead to highest welfare. However, we also find foreclosure in the downstream market if the potential degree of horizontal product differentiation of the entrant is low. Under ownership unbundling, investment incentives are lower but there is never foreclosure of the entrant since this would worsen <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation.</b> When the network operator is subject to a break-even regulation, the investment incentives are crowded out under legal and ownership unbundling whereas they remain nearly unchanged under vertical integration. Welfare and co umer surplus decrease under legal unbundling, but increase under the two other regimes. Vertical Integration, Investment, Foreclosure, Regulation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{theoretically}} {{evaluates the}} drug pricing policy in Japan and suggest an alternative more efficient policy. The Japanese current pricing rule “R 2 rule” causes high drug price and social inefficiency {{that is similar}} to the well-known <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> problem. To solve this problem, we derive an alternative pricing rule that we name “margin rate rule”. We show that the margin rate rule improves Pareto efficiency: the rule leads to both lower drug price and higher profit of the firms. There are three notable advantages in the margin rate rule. First, the government does not have to estimate the demand function, though it has the target price. The pharmaceutical firms, not the government, estimate drug efficacy, competition, and other demand information in pricing drugs. In this sense, the margin rate rule is a decentralised rule, and easy to manage. Second, the government can control the profit share between the firms and pharmacies in order to encourage pharmaceutical innovation. Third, the government can also control the drug-price margins so that meditations are not biased...|$|E
40|$|Resale Price Maintenance is a {{vertical}} contract {{in which a}} manufacturer sets the retail price. Traditional motivations for RPM are that it can avoid <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> and provide incentives for complementary service provision. This paper explores a new and complementary role for Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) {{as part of a}} price skimming strategy. RPM fixes the price path in dynamic markets. I argue that fixing the price path can improve upon price skimming strategies by providing commitment to future prices. Using a legislation change that deemed RPM illegal as a natural experiment, the effect of RPM as a commitment device is analysed empirically in two steps. First, using detailed and comprehensive retail sales data from the Norwegian book market, I show that in the absence of RPM, price skimming falters. Prices fall faster over the lifecycle and demand shifts from consumers buying early at high prices to later at lower prices. I then turn to quantify the dynamic effects of RPM. A distinction is made between two effects of RPM: it both eliminates price competition between retailers and coordinates prices over time. To separate out the price discrimination effect, I estimate a dynamic demand model and evaluate the returns to counterfactual vertical contracts in a dynamic oligopoly equilibrium model at the estimated parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|Segregation is {{studied as}} a multidimensional {{characteristic}} of individual behaviour in social space. It {{is argued that}} in a globalising world, homology among residential, territorial (forms of regionalising daily life) and interactive (forms of developing social networks) segregations cannot be taken for granted. The study shows {{that even in the}} highly segregated case of Arabs resident in Jaffa, the different dimensions of segregation only partially correlate, and they are explained by different mechanisms of exclusion. The results of the study suggest that structural constraints impact on ghettoisation of Arabs in Jaffa, {{but at the same time}} it is shown that Arabs respond differentially to these constraints. Four types of segregation are noted: (i) the majority, who are segregated in all three dimensions (residential, territorial and interactive); (ii) a small minority who succeeded in forming desegregated daily activity spaces and interethnic social networks regardless of their levels of residential segregation; (iii) those who failed to transform their desegregated daily activity spaces into interethnic social networks and (iv) those who succeeded in developing interethnic networks within the residential space of the ghetto. The analysis highlights the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> of Arab females, who are restricted to poor residential spaces by state and municipal renewal policies and to segregation in everyday life activity spaces by Arab males.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the nature of}} competition between national brands and store brands (otherwise known as private label or own label goods). We expound an analytical framework that allows for both price and non-price (quality) competition and use this to see how these different forms of rivalry interact in a setting where a leading retailer offering a store brand acts as both a customer and competitor to a national brand producer. This relationship thus entails both vertical and horizontal competition. We show that generally the retailer will seek to position its store brand {{as closely as possible}} to the national brand, by seeking to minimise the quality gap, but price the two goods very differently, with a wide price gap, as a means to segment consumers. Store brand introduction can lead to overall higher prices, so be against consumers’ interest, unless there is intense head-to-head rivalry for value-conscious consumers. Intense rivalry is more likely to happen if the national brand producer can exercise some control over its own product’s retail price (e. g. by being allowed to use maximum resale price maintenance) and has protection against copycat (lookalike) store brands ensuring a degree of differentiation between the competing products. Accordingly, we suggest that there are horizontal competition benefits on top of the usual vertical (alleviating <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation)</b> and intellectual property (to encourage brand investments) reasons to support respectively a more lenient policy stance towards RPM and a tougher stance against parasitic copycatting. The mix of horizontal and vertical aspects has important implications for undertaking market definition analysis in CPG markets, and specifically testing whether store brands and national brands are in the same product market. We highlight the considerable care needed in applying and interpreting the usual price and demand elasticity analysis used in market definition tests because of how segmentation and item-by-item retail pricing can distort demand and sales patterns...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative (AuSSI) is a {{partnership}} of the Australian Government {{and the states}} and territories that seeks to support primary and secondary schools and their communities to become sustainable. To date, the early childhood education sector has not been included within the AuSSI system and {{despite the efforts of}} early childhood researchers, advocates and educators who affirm that educatiion for sustinability in the early years is ‘essential not optional’ (Elliott, 2010), there are very few examples of what this may look like within the early childhood education sector and the pedagogy of teaching such content with young children. This paper identifies that one of the many inhibiting factors of early childhood education for sustainability is the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> effect. The early childhood sector is marginalised and sustainability is still marginalised in education, failing to become part of mainstream curriculum or {{an integral part of the}} education system. This is problematic because early childhood education for sustainability has been slow to take off, and has not been assisted by governments, funding or received the recognition to progress the systems that are needed to ensure its viability. This paper emerges from a research study that examined the progress of four children's services in Melbourne, as they implemented an early chidhood version of the AuSSI. It is hoped that the findings will open doors for the inclusion of the early childhood education sector in the AuSSI across Australia, and developments are already underway to progress this goal. As environmental degradation intensifies, there is a greater need for our youngest citizens to engage knowledgably, authentically and ethically with education for sustainability. It is essential that this commence in the earliest years of life and must therefore permeate the whole education establishment...|$|E
40|$|In {{an age of}} {{globalisation}} and internationalisation, {{how women}} learn to represent themselves {{in terms of their}} cultural, social and gender identities in the wider world is significant. A group of 17 Japanese women studying in postgraduate courses in three Australian universities were interviewed for part of this longitudinal project, and their case studies are presented in this paper to portray the women 2 ̆ 7 s lived experiences and interpret how higher education overseas affects their reconstruction of their 2 ̆ 7 selves 2 ̆ 7 and traditional Japanese femininity. I set my analytic framework through a discussion of the forceful globalisation of higher education and discourses of identity and 2 ̆ 7 self 2 ̆ 7, and then analyse the present status of Japanese women in contemporary Japan. I then provide excerpts of the women 2 ̆ 7 s narratives which indicate ambivalent 2 ̆ 7 selves 2 ̆ 7 in transition. Two possibilities have arisen from their narratives to illuminate this ambivalence - one possibility is that women 2 ̆ 7 s positive experiences in Australia and their increased and diverse exposure to and experience of other cultures may influence cultural change such as the transformation of constructs of women at home, and challenge existing identity and femininity discourses in Japan. The second possibility is that negative aspects of their 2 ̆ 7 diasporic experiences 2 ̆ 7 can also articulate other complex identity politics, such as Japanese women 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> 2 ̆ 7 which means being both a woman and a member of an ethnic minority group, conflicts between the homogenisation of 2 ̆ 7 Asian women 2 ̆ 7 and representations of 2 ̆ 7 new Japanese women 2 ̆ 7, and their sense of belongingness to their original culture. These contradictory phenomena of identity formations within Japanese women have the potential to shift the debate and challenge current essentialist views of hegemonic homogenisation of regional identities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to the growing historiography which questions the theory that feminism was diminished in the interwar years following the partial enfranchisement of women in 1918. It highlights that a diverse range of women’s organisations were thriving in interwar Scotland. This includes the outwardly feminist Glasgow Society for Equal Citizenship (GSEC) and Edinburgh Women Citizens Association (EWCA); the Scottish Cooperative Women’s Guild (the Guild), which was a largely based in urban working-class areas; and finally the Scottish Women’s Rural Institutes (the Rurals), which provides a rural comparison. Therefore a range of geographical and political contexts within Scotland are considered. 	This work explores the differing ways in which these organisations could be termed ‘feminist’, which involves questioning the way that feminism and feminist activism was defined in the interwar period. Each organisation had its own political concerns and demands, which highlight both differences and similarities between the organisations under consideration. However, all of these organisations were ultimately concerned with improving the lives of its members and empowering them. The attempts made by each organisation to achieve these aims are considered in relation to a working definition of feminism {{in order to determine the}} extent to which each organisation was ‘feminist’ in its activities. 	In addition, this thesis also addresses the <b>double</b> <b>marginalisation</b> of Scottish women in the established historiography. Scottish women are overwhelmingly neglected in accounts of British feminism in the interwar years. Research has tended to focus on developments in the national feminist movement, as represented by national organisations and prominent English feminists. Within such work ‘British’ can often translate as ‘English’. Recent contributions to the historiography of interwar feminism have, with few exceptions, continued this trend, although such research perhaps more explicitly focuses on England. Women are also marginalised within the discipline of Scottish history, which largely neglects women’s experiences of, and contributions to, Scottish society. While there are exceptions, the extent of attempts to include women in the narrative of Scottish history in published research often amounts to case studies or chapters on ‘gender’, rather than systematic and comprehensive inclusion of the female experience. 	This thesis therefore provides an in depth account of the diversity of interwar women’s organisations in Scotland, which builds upon recent studies of women’s political experiences in interwar Scotland, and also contributes to the wider historiography of interwar feminism. It also places women’s political experience in this period within the broader Scottish historiography, thereby including women in accounts of interwar political culture, as well as challenging the neglect of women in the historiography relating to interwar Scotland...|$|E
