5|$|When the Hugo awards were {{begun in}} 1953, each Worldcon {{organizing}} committee <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> awards they would give. Several awards were presented {{over the next}} few years which were not repeated in later conventions, unlike the primary categories which are still presented—such as Best Novel. These awards were the Best Cover Artist, Best Interior Illustrator, Excellence in Fact Articles, Best New SF Author or Artist, and #1 Fan Personality Hugos at the initial 1953 awards ceremony, the Best Feature Writer, Best Book Reviewer, and Most Promising New Author awards in 1956, the Outstanding Actifan award in 1958, and the Best New Author of 1958 award in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E
5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> to do with them. In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in the new government, but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the growing}} scale of the project, talks about {{changing}} Versus XIII into the next numbered entry in the series were appearing as early as 2007. When Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was renamed, and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were presented to Square Enix in 2011, {{it was decided to}} shift the game onto those consoles. For a time, a PlayStation 3 version continued development, but after a title change announcement could not be made in 2012, the shortening lifespan of the console caused concern for the company and team. After some trial and error, the PlayStation 3 was abandoned as lead platform in favor of a DirectX 11-based development structure that allowed for easy porting to the next-generation systems. Another presumed reason for the shift was due to the game's protracted development and escalating budget. The game was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and began development in this form in July 2012. At the beginning of development, the new team reviewed the content of Versus XIII and <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> could be sensibly carried over to the new project. While many design elements were retained, some needed to be changed or removed. Tabata's new position as co-director and eventually as director was related to this change. Intentions to turn the game into a musical after Nomura had seen the 2012 film adaptation of Les Misérables were vetoed by the higher-ups at Square Enix.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E

25|$|The two monks were {{assisted}} by an ex-monk {{and a senior}} minister at the court, Maha Dhamma Thingyan, who also checked the two main chronicles for historical sources, and <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> to accept and what to reject. U Yauk and U Chein scrutinized twelve volumes of old eigyin poems, and nine minor chronicles (yazawins) and five biographic chronicles (ayedawbons).

25|$|On November 1, 2007, {{the land}} swap deal with {{developer}} Kingston Gould III (first signed in January 2005) was finally approved. Although the City Council had {{signed off on}} the deal in June 2005, the city took another 25 months to change local zoning regulations so that Gould was exempted from building housing on his new site (as required by the agreement). Gould said he still had not <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> should be built there. The approval meant Gould could not begin considering what project to place on his land.|$|E

The 2012 vote was ultimately deferred. At an ITU/BIPM-sponsored workshop on the leap second, Dr. Han expressed his personal view in favor of abolishing the leap second, and similar support for the redefinition was again expressed by Dr. Han, along with other Chinese timekeeping scientists, at the URSI General Assembly in 2014.|$|E

In 1944, an order was given by the Haganah to create its own military police in the Jewish Brigade, and the task was given to a captain therein, named Daniel Lifshitz (later Danny Magen). Lifshitz and three sergeants from the brigade who served at a base near Cairo, Egypt were the initial nucleus of the organization, and recruited soldiers mainly from within the brigade itself.|$|E
25|$|Under the Treaties of Utrecht (11 April 1713), the European powers <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> {{the fate}} of Spain would be, {{in terms of the}} {{continental}} balance of power. The French prince Philippe of Anjou, grandchild of Louis XIV of France, became the new Bourbon king Philip V. He retained the Spanish overseas empire, but ceded the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and parts of Milan to the Duchy of Savoy; and Gibraltar and Menorca to the Kingdom of Great Britain. Moreover, Philip V granted the British the exclusive right to slave trading in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called asiento, as well as licensed voyages to ports in Spanish colonial dominions, openings, as Fernand Braudel remarked, for both licit and illicit smuggling.|$|E

The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done.
