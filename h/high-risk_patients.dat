In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of clinical complications associated with thrombophilia in three <b>high-risk</b> <b>patient</b> groups: women using oral oestrogen preparations, women during pregnancy and patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic treatments in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with thrombophilia during pregnancy and VTE in patients with thrombophilia, undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.

25|$|Endovascular repair {{first became}} {{practical}} in the 1990s {{and although it}} is now an established alternative to open repair, its role {{is yet to be}} clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients</b> or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in intensive care, less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

2500|$|For decades β-blockers {{have been}} used in {{cardiovascular}} medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. [...] A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for <b>high-risk</b> <b>patients.</b> [...] All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension.
