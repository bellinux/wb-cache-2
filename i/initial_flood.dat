50|$|The Cordilleran {{ice sheet}} also blocked the Clark Fork River and created Glacial Lake Missoula, rising behind a 2000 ft high ice dam in flooded valleys of western Montana. Over 2000 years the ice dam {{periodically}} failed, releasing approximately 40 high-volume Missoula Floods of water down the Columbia River drainage, passing through glacial Lake Columbia. The largest flood {{is estimated to}} be the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> at 2,500 km3 (600 mi3), with subsequent floods occurring at roughly 20 to 80 year intervals. Since Lake Columbia was impounded behind the Okanogan lobe, which rose to 1300 m, this lobe effectively blocked the normal course of the Columbia River, blocking the Missoula Floods and diverting water to flow across much of eastern Washington state. The erosion from the floods created the Grand Coulee as well as the Dry Falls, Palouse Falls, and the Channeled Scablands features of eastern Washington state.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Prediction of {{sedimentary}} architecture for {{modeling of}} flu-id flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers is accomplished mainly using stochastic, structure-imitating models, because {{these can be}} con-ditioned to data from wells, seismic profiles, and outcrop analogs. Con-ditioning implies that modeled architecture fits all available observa-tions. However, the sedimentary architecture simulated by such models is commonly unrealistic. Process-based (forward) models potentially provide more realistic prediction and understanding of sedimentary architecture, but these models are not widely used because conditioning to well, seismic, or outcrop data {{is considered to be}} very difficult. We show here that conditioning of process-based models to well data is possible in principle, using a 3 D alluvial-architecture model as an ex-ample. This model considers the formation of alluvial deposits as a predominantly deterministic process, with a single channel belt moving by avulsion over an aggrading floodplain. However, the <b>initial</b> <b>flood...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flood {{management}} planning by the Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) on Pajaro River and Correlitos Creek changes {{from the first}} levee design in 1945 {{to the most recent}} planning actions in 2004 as reflected in flow calculation and project design. The scope of project objectives expanded from the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> control project to the more recent whole watershed management study. The Pajaro River experience reflects the trend in flood management from 1945 to current day from single objective engineering methods to regulate flood flows in specific reaches of the river to a more holistic watershed management approach with multiple objectives. The European Union’s Water Framework Directive and Flood Directive are models for multi objective planning, which work together to improve rivers and streams to good ecological status. By looking to the previous channel restoration occurring in the European Union, and the influence of the good ecological status requirement of the WFD and FD, Pajaro River can incorporate some of the multiple objective planning measures currently being implemented in the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The {{object is}} to trace a single flood crest through the Maja outflow system and to {{evaluate}} the effects of topography on ponding and multiple channel routing. Maja Valles provides a good model {{because it has a}} single source and a well defined channel system. The 1500 km long Maja Valles originates in Juventae Chasma. The outflow system stretches 1100 km northward along the Lunae Planum/Xanthe Terra boundary, then eastward across the Xanthe Terra highlands. It descends to Chryse Planitia where it extends northeastward toward the middle of the basin. It is concluded that flood routing through multiple channels and retardation in local impoundments are responsible for breakup of the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> crest and the formation of multiple flood crests. Recombined flow near the mouths of these canyons results in an extended flow regime and multiple flood surges. As a result of ponding along the flood course, depositional sites are localized and renewed erosion downstream (from ponded sites) results in sediment source areas not greatly removed from depositional sites...|$|E

30|$|Since {{the surface}} {{coverage}} of AgNPs {{is directly related}} to the Ag deposition time [22, 34, 35], the lateral pitting for low deposition times can be attributed to a sparse Ag network [18, 34, 36] with some isolated AgNPs moving in random < 100 > directions due to their irregular shape [37]. The SiNW etch rate at the base is expected to increase with Ag deposition time due to the increase in the amount of Ag catalyst, which provides more surface area for hole injection by H 2 O 2. Moreover, a higher amount of Ag also means more oxidized Ag by H 2 O 2 [15, 17], resulting in a higher concentration of Ag+ ions that can contribute to Si dissolution via a galvanic displacement reaction [31]. On the other hand, the relatively high etch rates at the tips for Ag deposition times ≤ 1  min can be explained by an <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> lateral etching caused by irregularly shaped AgNPs from the sparse Ag network. The subsequent increases in tip etch rate with increasing Ag deposition time can be attributed to increasing rates of metal re-nucleation [17, 38] at the tips and, to a lesser extent, hole diffusion [31, 39].|$|E
40|$|As corals grow, they {{incorporate}} chemical {{indicators of}} seawater conditions into their aragonite skeleton {{after they have}} traversed an outer living tissue layer. Long-lived, massive coral skeletons can record decade-and century-long time series of seawater status. One such environmental clue is luminescence intensity which can correspond to river flow patterns and {{has been attributed to}} humic acid incorporation. Seawater humic acid levels are linked to river flow as rainfall extracts them from catchment soils to then flow into rivers and coastal seas. However, discrepancies exist when validating coral luminescence records against river flow data with intense luminescence sometimes occurring in the absence of increased flows. This contributes to uncertainty when reconstructing pre-instrumental river flows and rainfall from coral luminescence. Here we demonstrate that a major portion of coral core luminescence time series can be explained using a single-compartment, pharmacokinetic model that incorporates river flow measurements as the equivalent of drug dose. The model was robust for luminescence series in corals from near-shore reefs regularly influenced by river flow. The model implies that after floods, a proportion of subsequent luminescence peaks can be derived from the <b>initial</b> <b>flood.</b> This explains why some luminescence peaks after floods often do not correspond to additional significant river flows. This provides the first mechanism-based explanation for temporal changes in coral skeleton luminescence that incorporates a mathematical link between two independent time series making this proxy even more robust for reconstructing river flow and rainfall...|$|E
40|$|The rapidity {{at which}} global landscapes are being {{transformed}} by environmental change has revived {{the importance of}} biological monitoring. Protected areas harbour {{some of the most}} biodiverse assemblages on the planet, typically show the least historical impacts from humans and likely represent areas showing natural patterns, process dynamics and fluctuations that can be compared with areas more directly impacted by humans, especially as the human population grows. This paper provides examples of different biomonitoring programmes in three protected areas in Switzerland, ranging from a large experimental flow program and recent land annex in the Swiss National Park, to a historical analysis of a designated floodplain of national importance. The data (1999 – present) from the experimental flood study have documented substantial changes in biota that have occurred 7 – 10 years after the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> results as the system enters new ecological states. Monitoring of the land annex in the national park since 2000 has allowed documentation of temporal shifts in physico-chemistry and diatoms that were related to environmental changes in Alpine landscapes. The analysis of historical photo’s of the protected floodplain showed the effects of earlier impacts on floodplain structure and function that are evident today. The results demonstrate the kinds of data that can be generated from biomonitoring programmes with different objectives and goals and how these data can be used to understand eco-evolutionary and ecosystem processes better in the face of rapid landscape transformation...|$|E

40|$|The {{geologic}} mapping compiled at 1 : 500, 000 {{scale of}} the northern Kasei Valles area of Mars (MTMs 25062 and 25067) indicates (1) at least three periods of Kasei Valles channeling, (2) the development of Sacra Fossae (linear depressions on Tempe Terra and Lunae Planum) in relation to Kasei channeling episodes, and (3) the nature of ridged plains material dissected by Kasei Valles on northern Lunae Planum. (The three channeling periods consists of two flood events and a later, sapping related event). These findings suggest hydrologic conditions and processes that formed Kasei Valles and associated features and terrains.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeologyAllen W. ArcherTurnagain Arm is the hypertidal (commonly {{exceeding}} 9 m) west-east trending {{extension of}} Cook Inlet in south-central Alaska. The inlet formed from a drowned glacial valley that was subsequently filled with tidal deposits of silt and fine sand. The tidal system is semidiurnal with a prominent diurnal inequality. There are also variations due to spring and neap tides. Turnagain Arm {{is home to}} a tidal bore generated during spring tides that can reach heights of up to 2 m and travel at speeds of up to 5 m/s. Current reversals can be dramatic with ebb tidal velocities of 6 m/s changing to flood velocities of 10 m/s over a period of a few minutes. During the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> tide, highly turbid water can rise as fast as 10 cm/min. This combination of elements results in a highly dynamic depositional setting. Measurements taken in the inner estuary during several neap-spring cycles in the summers of 2007 - 08 documented deposition upon mud bars of as much as 8. 9 cm per tidal event. Conversely, erosion of up to 13. 5 cm per tidal event has been measured. The highest rates of deposition and erosion occurred during the spring tides while much lower rates occur during the neap tides. Some portions of the inner estuary are only submerged during the extreme high tides. The magnitude of the high tide needed to cover each site increases with increasing distance into the upper estuary. Even if submerged, deposition does not always occur. Such a high percentage of non-depositional events has real implications when interpreting tidal cyclicity of the rhythmites found at these sites...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of the geologic record offshore of small mountainous rivers is event-driven and, more so than many other environments, can result in relatively complete sequences. One such river, the Waipaoa in New Zealand, has been studied from its terrestrial source to its oceanic sink over timescales spanning storms, seasons, and the Holocene. This study focused on the {{formation of}} riverine deposits on the Waipaoa Shelf during episodic flood and wave events, contrasting deposition during short-lived events to accumulation patterns created over thirteen months. Sediment fluxes and fate were estimated using the numerical hydrodynamic and sediment transport model ROMS, the Regional Ocean Modeling System, using CSTMS, the Community Sediment Transport Modeling System. During the study period (January 2010 –February 2011), the model indicated that <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> deposition generally occurred near the river mouth and along the coast in water shallower than 40 m, and that deposition during any one event was sensitive to variations in shelf currents and wave energy. Also, the sedimentation due to plume settling and suspended transport during these relatively short flood and wave events were not aligned with longer time-scale accumulation patterns (months or greater) previously reported for the Waipaoa shelf. In the days to months following a flood pulse, waves episodically reworked this initial deposit, resuspending centimeter-scale layers of sediment during energetic periods. Frequent and intense resuspension occurred in shallow areas where bed stresses were high. This encouraged redistribution of material toward deeper areas having lower near-bed wave stresses, including continental shelf depocenters and offshore areas. While fast settling material was preferentially retained near the river mouth, currents dispersed slower settling sediment farther before deposition. Overall, accumulation depended on characteristics of oceanographic transport (wave energy, current velocities), not just source characteristics (flood size, sediment size distribution) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} and suspended sediment transport processes in response to sequential reclamations over the intertidal flat, Jiangsu coast, {{which used to be}} one of the widest intertidal flats in China. Investigations into the sediment transport patterns reveal that net suspended sediment fluxes increased from 102 kg m? 1 on the upper intertidal flat to 103 – 4 kg m? 1 on the lower intertidal flat, per tidal cycle. This variation was caused mainly by the phases of the current velocity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), local bed geomorphology, inundation patterns, and extreme weather conditions. The longshore component of tidal currents intensifies seaward over the intertidal flat. Extreme weather conditions (e. g. storms) and strong winds were important factors affecting the current velocity structures, the intensity of residual currents, and the SSCs. The SSCs were characterized by several peaks throughout the tidal cycle. These peaks were associated with strong currents, combined wave-current interactions and intense turbulences due to the <b>initial</b> <b>flood</b> surge. Furthermore, the suspended sediment was finer and contained more clay materials during the flood phase of the tidal cycle, than during the ebb. Fine particles were transported within the upper water column by landward residual currents, but coarse particles were transported within the lower water column by seaward residual currents. Overall, residual currents were apt to transport fine-grained sediment landward and coarse-grained sediment seaward. This pattern indicates that the suspended sediment fluxes are highly variable in the water column, even for very shallow tidal environments. The cross-shore component accounted only for a small percentage of the total sediment flux. However, this part of sediment supply dominated accretion over the intertidal flat. The intertidal flat has become narrower and steeper, following sequential reclamations. A negative feedback process existed to maintain the convex profile shape, although the human activities (i. e. reclamation) could have modified the natural process. The surficial sediment tended to become finer on the mid-upper intertidal flat but coarser on the lower intertidal flat following reclamations, in response to a reduction in the tidal currents over the intertidal zone and enhancement of wave action over the lower intertidal flat. Accretion, with high rates, was maintained by landward transport of sediment. In such an accretional system with influences of reclamation, the width or slope of the intertidal flat is adjusted continuously. Before the cease of reclamation, the intertidal flat is unable to achieve an equilibrium shape...|$|E

40|$|Abundant {{evidence}} exists for lakes on Mars both from orbital observations [e. g., 1 - 3] and in situ exploration [e. g., 4 - 5]. These lakes {{can be divided}} into two classes: those that were hydrologically closed, so their source valley(s) terminated at the basin [3], and those that were hydrologically open, where there was sufficient flow from inlet valley(s) to cause the lake to breach and form an outlet valley [2]. It is easier to be confident from orbital data alone that a standing body of water must have existed in open basins, because {{there is no other way}} for their perched outlet valleys to form. The majority of basins fed by valley networks, rather than by isolated inlet valleys, are open [6], with some important exceptions (e. g., Gale Crater). Jezero crater (Fig. 1) is one of the most well-studied open basin paleolakes on Mars, with a breach that re-mains well above the lowest part of the crater floor, and two sedimentary fans at its northwestern margin that are likely deltaic in origin [7 - 9]. CRISM observations of these sediments indicate they host a variety of alteration minerals [9 - 11], including smectite and carbonate, and both the mineralogy of the sediments and their settings suggest they have a strong potential for preserving organic materials [10]. As a result, Jezero is a strong candidate landing site for the Mars 2020 rover. Approximate formative discharges have been estimated for its well-preserved western fan (Q approximately 500 m 3 /s) [7], but to our knowledge, no estimates for the dis-charges associated with formation and incision of its outlet valley have been presented. Indeed, only a few studies [e. g., 12 - 14] have attempted to reconstruct the formation of outlet breaches broadly similar to Jezero anywhere on Mars, despite the apparent commonality of basins with large outlets [e. g., 2]. The outlet valley formed as a dam breach when the lake overflowed. In such an event, the growth and incision of the breach is directly coupled to flood discharge. In the case of Jezero, the discharge through the breach eventually lacked the energy needed to erode through the dam further, preventing complete drainage of the lake. After the <b>initial</b> <b>flood,</b> further incision can take place if additional water flows into, and thus out of, the hydrologically open lake, though the rate of this erosion occurs under more typical fluvial conditions. Despite this qualitative understanding of the process, it is useful to explore numerically what range of model parameters are potentially consistent with obser-vations of the outlet. We ultimately seek to address questions that include: (1) What was the flood hydro-graph?, (2) What sediment transport processes were involved and what can we infer about the erosion process? (3) Can most or all of the Jezero outlet's morphology be explained as a consequence of catastrophic formation, or is additional longer-term erosion required...|$|E
