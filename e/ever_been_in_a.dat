5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
500|$|September 10, {{the day of}} the hurricane, is also a {{national}} holiday for British Honduras, on which many locals gather in the streets to celebrate the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798. It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hurricane and didn't know exactly how bad it was going to be." [...] Additionally, there was also belief among residents of Belize City that the reefs would provide a barrier against large tidal waves.|$|E

[...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was the last song {{recorded}} for New Again. According to Lazzara, the lyrics were [...] "the most blatant that I've <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> song". The demo for the song was originally acoustic with an organ, mostly instrumental, and ran for 6–7 minutes. Fazzi praised the track, as did Rubano. The song subsequently went through various arrangement changes. The riff for [...] "Cut Me Up Jenny" [...] came from Lazzara: [...] "I was so bored and so lazy, I picked up the guitar and then the [...] That's where it came from and we made a song out of it." [...] Lazzara described it as [...] "a little choppy" [...] with [...] "a nice groove to it". Fazzi said the track has a [...] "crazy 80s vibe, it's a very different song for Taking Back Sunday", while Rubano said it contained hints of Phoenix and Bloc Party. When [...] "Catholic Knees" [...] existed as a rough idea, Fazzi suggested that the group change the time signature to 7/4. Lazzara cited it as an example of Fazzi's influence on the band: [...] "Cause none of us would have thought to [...]" [...] Reyes compared the track to Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters.|$|E

[...] "The Anarchists" [...] (referring to the Spanish CNT and FAI) were [...] "in control", tipping was prohibited by workers themselves, and servile forms of speech, such as [...] "Señor" [...] or [...] "Don", were abandoned.

They dispelled tabloid-fueled rumors, including suggestions that Fawcett had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coma, had ever reached 86 pounds, and had ever given up her fight against the disease or lost the will to live. Jackson decried such fabrications, saying they [...] "really do hurt {{a human being and}} a person like Farrah." [...] Piro recalled when it became necessary for Fawcett to undergo treatments that would cause her to lose her hair, acknowledging [...] "Farrah probably has the most famous hair in the world", but also {{that it is not a}} trivial matter for any cancer patient, whose hair [...] "affects [...] whole sense of who [...] are". Of the documentary, Jackson averred Fawcett [...] "didn't do this to show that 'she' is unique, she did it to show that we are all unique...

2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
