40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>mills</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the mining, cement and minerals processing industries. Numerous failures of drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> have occurred in recent years. The components are not meeting their required design lives leaving mill owners concerned about the expensive repair costs and lost profits associated with the mill downtime during repairs. There {{is a need to}} research the design methodology of the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> and the analysis of fatigue failures in mills and similar equipment e. g. kilns in order to develop a comprehensive and improved picture of how to design and operate these mills. As with numerous other engineered items, the critical issue is that a thorough understanding of the type, magnitude, direction, and duration of all loads that the components will experience while in operation is required in order to design them correctly. A literature survey was performed to research advanced design methods and identify sources of loading data <b>for</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Many interesting references were identified but no specific examples were found where strain gauge measurements were used to quantify the loads experienced by the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Strain gauge measurements were conducted on the drivetrains of 30 <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> The measured data was processed and analysed to determine the key operating loads experienced by the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> drivetrain components.

40|$|A <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit forms {{a crucial}} part in the {{energy-intensive}} comminution process of extracting valuable metals and minerals from mined ore. The ability to control the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is of primary importance to achieve the desired product specification with regards to quality and production rate. In order to achieve control objectives an accurate dynamic model of the milling circuit is required. Phenomenological models are preferred over linear-time-invariant models since the latter cannot describe the non-linear behaviour of the process. However, the available phenomenological models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits are usually complex, use large parameter sets and are mostly aimed towards steady-state design of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits. This study investigates simplified non-linear dynamic models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits suitable <b>for</b> process controller design. In {{the first part of}} this study, the number of size classes in a cumulative rates model of a <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is reduced to determine the minimum number required to provide a reasonably accurate model of the circuit for process control. Each reduced size class set is used to create a non-linear cumulative rates model which is linearized to design a linear model predictive controller. The accuracy of a model is determined by the ability of the corresponding model predictive controller to control important process variables in the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit as represented by the full non-linear cumulative rates model. The second part of the study validates a simple and novel non-linear model of a run-of-mine <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit developed <b>for</b> process control and estimation purposes. This model is named the Hulbert-model and makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate. It consists of separate feeder, mill, sump and hydrocyclone modules that can be connected to model different circuit configurations. The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The Hulbert-model parameters are fitted to an existing plant’s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Laboratory <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> {{operated}} <b>for</b> a {{given time}} interval do not consider the effect of circulating load (CL), thus generating excessively wide cement particle size distribution (PSD) curves that are not representative of what is normally obtained from real-scale mills. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a locked-cycle protocol that takes CL into account and mimics the clinker grinding operations encountered in closed-circuit industrial ball mills. The protocol consisted of screening the laboratory mill content after each grinding run to remove undersize, which is then replenished with an equal mass of new clinker until CL becomes constant. For given Blaine fineness, test results have shown that cement ground in the laboratory for a fixed time interval possesses wide PSD curves characterized by spread factor n less than 0. 96. Conversely, the locked-cycled protocol led to narrower PSD, with n varying from 1. 025 to 1. 175. Cement ground using the lockedcycle protocol was found to require increased water demand as compared to that ground for afixed time interval. Also, this protocol was found to generate a reducedfraction of particles finer than 1 μ/m, which led to relatively delayed setting times and reduced 1 -day compressive strength. The locked-cycle approach led to higher 28 -day compressive strength, given the reduced fraction of particles larger than 50 μ/m. PublishedN/...|$|R
