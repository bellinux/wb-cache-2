In this paper, the basic principle and application of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> technology were briefly introduced first. Then {{the structure of the}} innovative hybrid brake with double disc was put forward. It employed an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> to reduce brake pad wear and braking system thermal recession. Based on the design requirements, the friction brake and the {{electromagnetic brake}} were designed respectively. Finally, in order to verify that whether the designed hybrid brake meets the design requirements, a bench test was carried out. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> torque characteristic was tested. The results showed that the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> torque could approach 198 N·m.

Magnetic track brake is a {{new kind}} of rail transit vehicle braking mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of magnetic track brake The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} laboratory based {{experimental study of}} a controllable <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system utilising eddy current. The main focus was to study parameters related to the eddy current <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system and to apply the system on a test study application. This study explored potential benefits over conventional braking systems, including in the reduction of brake pad wear and wear debris contamination due to hazardous materials such as copper. The objective was {{to design and fabricate}} a test rig in order to investigate the relationship between variable parameters that affect the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system response and to implement the controllable system on an undertaken test case. Two test rigs were constructed for the study on the interactions of variable parameters and on the test case application. Laboratory experiments were carried out to examine the correlation between parameters such as the coil current, air gap widths, types of disc brakes, disc thickness, and number of turns of the electromagnetic coil. Two different materials, Al 6061 and Al 7075 were also compared in this response experiment. In the validation part of the experiment, related optimum parameters found from the response part were used in implementing the eddy current <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system on a stationary exercise bicycle. From the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} parameters have some effect on certain braking behaviour. Braking force increased as the coil current increased, as also with the use of a smaller air gap, larger number of coil turns and thicker disc. Three types of disc material were tested: aluminium, zinc and copper; subsequently, aluminium was found to be the best among the three. It was also found that Al 6061 performed better than Al 7075. The eddy current electromagnetic brake was tested for exercise purposes, taking the coil current as the controllable parameter. Increasing the coil current caused the cycling resistance to increase, and hence the intensity of the exercise also increased. From this research, it was shown that the eddy current electromagnetic brake could be successfully implemented as a controllable braking system on a test static exercise bicycle. Thus, this system has great potential to be explored as an alternative to present-day conventional braking system...|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{superfluid}} core of a neutron star super-rotates relative to the crust, because stratification prevents the core from responding to the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>braking</b> torque, until the relevant dissipative (viscous or Eddington-Sweet) time-scale, which can exceed ~ 10 ^ 3 yr and is much longer than the Ekman timescale, has elapsed.

Persistent core super-rotation alters our picture of neutron stars in several ways, allowing for magnetic field generation by ongoing dynamo action and enhanced gravitational wave emission from hydrodynamic instabilities.
