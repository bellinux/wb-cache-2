5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>beads</b> for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} Hermann Hesse’s novel, The <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game, in {{the light}} of Paulo Freire’s educational philosophy. The <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game is set in Castalia, a “pedagogical province” of the 23 rd century. It is argued that the central character in the book, Joseph Knecht, undergoes a complex process of conscientisation. Knecht develops an increasingly critical understanding of Castalian society, questioning some of its most cherished assumptions while nonetheless deepening his appreciation of the beauty of the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game. He becomes less certain of his certainties as he grows older, and eventually decides to give away his prestigious post as Magister Ludi (Master of the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game) to pursue a quiet life as a tutor. Dialogue {{plays a key role in}} the development of Knecht’s critical consciousness. Freirean theory is seen to provide a robust framework for the analysis of key themes in Hesse’s text. At the same time, The <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game is helpful in demonstrating the meaning and significance of conscientisation and dialogue for educational lives...|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere between 100 and 200 {{million years}} after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar crust began to flood the low-lying areas. These lava flows were often {{accompanied}} by fire fountains that blanketed the surrounding area with tiny <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> These beads were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at Shorty crater. Most of these beads, however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of the Serenitatis basin from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely {{that it was one of}} his subjects who developed the craft.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} technology, utopia and scholarly life in Hermann Hesse’s novel, The <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game. In {{the first part of}} Hesse’s book, the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game and the society of which it is a part, Castalia, are portrayed in idealistic terms. The second part of the novel chronicles the educational life of Joseph Knecht, who progresses through Castalia’s elite schooling system, learns to play the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bead</b> Game, and is eventually appointed to the supreme position of Magister Ludi (Master of the Game). Knecht’s words, thoughts, relationships, and deeds pose a challenge to the narrator’s idealistic portrait, with important implications for scholars and educationists.

5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E

In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt.

5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang.

5|$|A {{maritime}} route {{opened up}} with the Chinese-controlled port of Rinan in Jiaozhi (centred in modern Vietnam) and the Khmer kingdom of Funan by the 2nd century AD, if not earlier. Jiaozhi was proposed by Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877 {{to have been the}} port known to the Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy as Cattigara, situated near modern Hanoi. Ptolemy wrote that Cattigara lay beyond the Golden Chersonese (the Malay Peninsula) and was visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander, most likely a merchant. Richthofen's identification of Cattigara as Hanoi was widely accepted until archaeological discoveries at Óc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City) in the Mekong Delta during the mid-20th century suggested this may have been its location. Granville Allen Mawer states that Ptolemy's Cattigara seems to correspond with the latitude of modern Óc Eo, where Roman goods and native jewellery imitating Antonine Roman coins have been found. At Óc Eo, which was once located along the coastline, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his successor Marcus Aurelius. Ancient Roman <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and bracelets were also found at the site.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveReliable {{platelet}} function monitoring is desirable in patients treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors. The {{aim of the}} present laboratory-based study was to assess {{platelet function}} after administration of clinically relevant doses of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist tirofiban with or without heparin by using Sonoclot (Sienco Inc) and platelet aggregometry. MethodsTirofiban (0 - 100 ng·mL− 1) and heparin (0 or 1 U·mL− 1) were added to blood samples obtained from 20 healthy volunteers. Coagulation analysis was performed on citrated whole blood by using the Sonoclot analyzer. The glass bead–activated test and the new <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase were used. The results were compared with adenosine- 5 ′-diphosphate–activated platelet aggregometry. ResultsAdministration of tirofiban showed a similar increase of platelet inhibition detected with the Sonoclot glass bead–activated test and <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase, {{as well as by}} means of aggregometry. Bias between the different techniques was comparable; Spearman rank correlation was strong (glass bead–activated test vs aggregometry: ρ = 0. 823, P <. 001; <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase vs aggregometry: ρ = 0. 856, P <. 001). After additional administration of heparin, platelet inhibition was only comparable for the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase and aggregometry, and the correlation coefficient remained unchanged for the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase versus aggregometry (ρ = 0. 878, P <. 001). By contrast, the glass bead–activated test showed a nearly complete platelet inhibition with a significant bias compared with the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase and aggregometry. Correlation was weak for the glass bead–activated test versus aggregometry (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 407, P =. 004). ConclusionsWhen compared with platelet aggregometry, the glass bead–activated test from Sonoclot reliably detects glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition with tirofiban in unheparinized whole blood. However, in heparinized blood the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> test with heparinase is essential to accurately assess platelet function...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E
