A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of [...] "what isn't there, can't go wrong". [...] Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. [...] Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. [...] Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.|$|E

With {{consideration}} of the viscosity of semi-solid aluminum alloy slurry and the mold filling characteristics in die casting, the <b>die-casting</b> <b>mould</b> for semi-solid aluminum alloy has been designed and manufactured {{on the basis of}} the standard samples. The process of mold filling and solidification of semi-solid aluminum alloy in die casting was simulated by using ProCAST software. With combination of simulation results with die casting experimental data, the results indicate that the influence of heating system of the mould and cross section of ingate for the mould on flowing of semi-solid aluminum alloy in mould cavity is important in this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that the main failure {{mechanisms}} in <b>die-casting</b> <b>mould</b> are heat checking due to thermal fatigue and melt-out caused by chemical reaction between die and molten alloys. Thermal fatigue tests were carried out using the thermal cycle simulator to establish the proper method to estimate the thermal fatigue resistance of hot die steel. In this study, the thermal shock tester consisted of induction heating and water spray cooling unit was constructed to evaluate thermal crack propagation resistance and the sum of crack length per unit specimen length, Lm is proposed as the index representing the susceptibility to crack initiation and propagation. Also, new concept of measurement for the melt-out behavior was suggested. AISI H 13 hot work tool steel was solution treated and tempered at various temperatures, to control the hardness and toughness that have effect on the behavior of thermal crack propagation. The result of thermal fatigue test showed that there is optimum value of hardness and impact energy to maximize the thermal crack propagation resistance. The influence of nitriding on melt-out resistance was also investigated. The dissolution rate due to melt-out phenomenon tended to be smaller for thicker compound layer. Furthermore, the resistance to melt-out was affected by the compound layer thickness rather than that of diffusion layer. The results of the both tests properly reflect the effect of materials properties on failure modes of <b>die-casting</b> <b>mould</b> and it means those test methods are suitable to evaluate the durability of hot work tool steel for die-casting...|$|R
40|$|Transition metal {{carbides}} {{are used in}} industry as protective hard coatings as they combine high hardness and wear resistance with a lower friction coefficient than nitrides. Tantalum and molybdenum carbides are examples of coatings that are widely used industrially in some specific applications. For example, they are often employed as protective materials against wear and adhesion in <b>die-casting</b> <b>moulds.</b> Although these {{metal carbides}} do not present an extremely high hardness, they possess excellent low friction and wear resistant properties. These interesting properties make these coatings excellent candidates for use in applications that involve sliding contact situations. In this paper, we present a tribological characterization of tantalum and molybdenum carbide coatings, each in two variants with different chemical composition, in abrasive and sliding wear conditions against alumina and hardened steel. The results were compared to those of a titanium nitride reference coating. It {{was found that the}} tantalum and molybdenum carbide coatings were not as resistant to abrasion as the titanium nitride. However, due to their extremely low friction coefficient values they were considered superior in sliding applications against both steel and alumina...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When using Large-scale semi-opened copper <b>mould</b> <b>die-casting</b> machine, it {{can reduce}} the {{shrinkage}} cavity and porosity, improve the surface roughness and the mechanical properties of the copper mould. But its process parameters are selected by experience, which result in unstable quality of the anode plate copper mould. In this paper, the temperature and stress fields of the copper mould were simulated using finite element method. And {{the effects of the}} initial temperature on the copper mould quality were studied further. The preliminary optimization scheme of the die-casting initial temperature was gained, which can provide the foundation for the further process parameters optimization of the copper <b>mould</b> <b>die-casting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tools and {{industrial}} moulds {{are used by}} industries such as the metal stamping, <b>die-casting</b> and plastics <b>moulding</b> industries to give the final form to the products they manufacture. Manufacturing of tools and moulds influences the entire production {{of a large number}} of components, subassemblies and assemblies in many sectors, like motor vehicles, electronics, appliances, packaging. Short lead times, continuous changes in quantity and quality of orders and absence of correct work methods may cause fluctuations up to 40 percent between the pre and post calculation cost (and consequently variation of price). In the lapse of time between customer offer and mould production costs could vary up to 30 %; thus time dynamic costs, such as material cost and labor cost must be expected to reach a correct estimation of final price. A possible solution of the problem of miscalculation depending on disregarding time-dynamic costs is the integration of stock-market related pricing methods in the tool and mould manufacturing industry. Based on the described problems, the focus of this thesis is to establish a method to integrate time-dynamics costs, such as material costs or external labor, in the price estimation of the tool and mould manufacturing industries, to reduce price fluctuations. To forecast time-dynamic costs, furthermore, a method to integrate stock-market related pricing mechanisms in the tool and mould manufacturing industry will be developed. These objectives are based on the idea that the price estimation process could be optimized with the integration of time-dynamics costs and their prediction based on stock-market related mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of the paper {{was to investigate the}} structure and corrosion properties of amorphous and crystalline Mg-based alloys for biodegradable implants. This paper presents a preparation method and the structure, microhardness and corrosion properties characterization of Mg 70 Zn 30 and Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 alloys in the form of plates. Design/methodology/approach: The studied samples were prepared by the pressure <b>die-casting</b> to copper <b>mould.</b> The structure of the both alloys was examined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thermal properties of the samples were examined using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In addition, corrosion properties research (immersion tests) were performed in a physiological fluid. Microhardness was measured using the Vickers microtester. Findings: The results of X-ray diffraction investigations confirmed that the sample of Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 alloy is amorphous and sample of Mg 70 Zn 30 alloy has crystalline structure. Immersion tests of both samples have shown homogeneous progress of corrosion. The changes of a structure caused by calcium addition resulted in an increase of microhardness for sample Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 compared with the sample of Mg 70 Zn 30 alloy. Research limitations/implications: Results of immersion tests are dependent of used fluid. In this paper used physiological (multielectrolyte) fluid to corrosion studies, which composition is similar to the electrolyte composition of the blood plasma. Chemical composition of fluid used in corrosion studies could be affected to results of studies. Therefore it is appropriate to carry out comparative studies such as electrochemical corrosion studies. Practical implications: Mg-based alloys can be applied as the medical implants. The chemical composition of the samples Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 and Mg 70 Zn 30 was chosen, because they meet the requirements of a biodegradable material, that is, material, which after completing their stability function will dissolve {{in the body of the}} patient without the harmful effects on health. Originality/value: Crystalline and amorphous magnesium alloys are examined as a material for biodegradable medical implants. This new concept is an alternative to previously used conventional implant materials. New concept doesn’t require re-operation, and allows foreign object to remain in the human body...|$|R
40|$|Defects and {{imperfections}} are intrinsically {{generated by}} casting processes, due to several reasons. The final properties and in-service behaviour of castings are always related to microstructural features and to defects and imperfections: both microstructure and defects/imperfections {{are the results}} of process stages, alloys properties and dies & tools design. As an example, it should be considered that in HPDC filling stage extreme conditions are established: complexity of components leads to complex dies, and the high production rates required (up to 120 shots/h) lead to very high filling velocities for the molten alloy (up to 40 m/s) with strong generation of turbulence in the flow. Solidification takes place in few seconds, and the die is first in contact with a molten alloy at more than 700 °C and, after 30 - 40 seconds, with a sprayed lubricant at room temperature. For these reasons HPDC (as well as other Aluminium alloys casting processes, such as permanent mould casting process) {{can be considered a}} “defect generating process”. Not only an average 5 - 10 % scrap is typically produced, but the type, size and severity of defects and imperfections are varying. From these considerations, it seems that the potential of high-pressure <b>die-casting</b> and permanent <b>mould</b> casting processes will be completely exploited only when the quality level will be perfectly optimised. In this regard, the analysis of defects and imperfections allows the foundry to monitor the products quality respect to a quality standard. Further, the analysis of defects and imperfections provide to the foundry useful correlations between their type/distribution and their origin, so that it could be possible to define process modification for improving the quality. One of the current targets of the StaCast project is the compilation and dissemination of common tools to allow foundries to define a proper, comparable, quality standard. The first tool to be proposed is a common basis of language, i. e. a terminology and classification of defects and imperfections in order to help die-casting foundries to face with increased confidence and ability the defect-related issues, to assure quality and reliability of their products...|$|R
