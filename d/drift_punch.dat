5000|$|A drift [...] "punch" [...] is misleadingly named; it is {{not used}} as a punch in the {{traditional}} sense of the term. A <b>drift</b> <b>punch,</b> or drift pin, or lineup punch, is used as an aid in aligning bolt or rivet holes prior to inserting a fastener. A <b>drift</b> <b>punch</b> is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a <b>drift</b> <b>punch</b> is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force is never (and should never be) applied to the tip, or end of a drift pin.|$|E
5000|$|A pritchel {{is a type}} of punch used in forging, {{particularly}} in making nail holes in horseshoes. The horseshoe is heated and a hole is punched through 90 percent of the steel with a forepunch or <b>drift</b> <b>punch.</b> The pointed end of the tool should be kept sharp and so that the burr is cut out smoothly. The punched hole is lined up over the pritchel hole and the pritchel is driven into the hole, knocking out the remaining metal {{at the bottom of the}} punched hole. [...] The temperature of the pritchel should be always below the red-hot stage as the tool itself will bend and lose the temper. When over-heated it is advised to cool it in water intermediately.|$|E
50|$|In metalworking, a {{drift pin}}, drift pin punch, slave pin, simply drift, or even pokey bit {{is the name}} for a tool used for {{enlarging}} holes, or aligning holes prior to bolting or riveting metal parts together. A drift pin is not used as a punch {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. A drift is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a <b>drift</b> <b>punch</b> is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force should never be applied to the tip of drift pin.|$|E
50|$|Djay {{includes}} three FX control panes for different mixing styles: a one-touch panel for instant FX, a custom pane, and a 2D touch interface. Flanger, Phaser, Echo, Gate, Bit Crusher, Filter (High Pass, Low Pass), {{as well as}} six preconfigured instant effects: Absorb, <b>Drift,</b> Sway, Crush, <b>Punch,</b> Twist are bundled in with Djay.|$|R
5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a <b>drift</b> <b>punch</b> is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|E
