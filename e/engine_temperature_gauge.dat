50|$|The {{instrumentation}} console {{for this}} motorcycle is also modeled anew. It includes an analog speedometer and tachometer, {{with a digital}} display for the odometer, gear position indicator, trip-meter and <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> Also included is an analog fuel gauge and a digital compass. Also included is a windscreen, which can be manually adjusted for height via screws to two positions.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the engine}} configuration, the bike had water cooling, a {{six-speed}} transmission for good economy at highway speed, and common on other middleweight bikes for Honda {{in the early}} 1980s, shaft drive. While the shaft drive is very convenient with virtually no maintenance required (and no oil getting slung around), it also robbed some power from where it was more evidently lacking on in town or lower speed riding. Features like twin horns, hydraulic clutch, and an <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> add nice touches to the bike. A coil sprung, oil bath, air preload front fork with anti-dive valving was an improvement, although the Magna did not benefit from the linkage based single shock {{that was on the}} Sabre and Interceptor.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine block}} was {{water-cooled}} using a radiator that most 21st-century car owners minded {{to lift the}} hood / bonnet would instantly recognised as such. But here, too, the approach was not entirely conventional. Possibly reflecting the colder winter temperatures routinely experienced {{in central and eastern}} Europe, the radiator was protected on its outer face by a blind which could be raised or lowered from the driver's seat, a device also employed on certain Russian automobiles. In cold weather the driver was able to minimise the quantity of cold air passing through the radiator by completely lowering the radiator-blind. This minimised the period during which the engine operated below its efficient operating temperature. Informed by a facia-mounted <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> the driver was able to anticipate and avoid the risk of overheating by raising the radiator blind as the engine approached its efficient operating temperature of 80 °C (176 °F).|$|E
25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|R
50|$|The ground {{clearance}} increases to 8.7 in, {{and is the}} ninth Subaru vehicle to feature continuously variable transmission (CVT). The double-sized moonroof is no longer being offered, and {{has been reduced to}} a conventional size that doesn't extend over the rear seats. The turbocharged engine is also no longer offered on all international versions of the Outback. An <b>engine</b> coolant <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> is no longer offered, replaced by a fuel economy gauge instead. When the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> is below normal, an indicator light shines blue and when the engine is overheating, the light turns red. Using the key to unlock the drivers' door after locking the vehicle with the remote will set off the security system; the vehicle must be unlocked with the remote, a tradition going back to the first generation when remote keyless access was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} design {{tradition}}s have {{ended with the}} fifth generation. The side windows are no longer frameless, ending a Subaru tradition started with the first generation Leone in the early 1970s. On wagons, the [...] "D" [...] pillar is no longer covered in glass. The parking light switch traditionally installed {{on top of the}} steering wheel column has also been removed, with Subaru using conventional headlight electrics, meaning if the headlights are left on when the engine is turned off, the headlights remain on unless the automatic headlight feature switch position is being used. An <b>engine</b> coolant <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> is no longer offered, replaced by a fuel economy gauge instead that gives estimates in either miles per gallon or kilometers per liter based on regional requirements where the vehicle is sold. When the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> is below normal, an indicator light shines blue and when the engine is overheating, the light turns red. Using the key to unlock the drivers' door after locking the vehicle with the remote will set off the security system; the vehicle must be unlocked with the remote, a tradition going back to the second generation when remote keyless access was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Moving {{heat from}} the {{cylinder}} to a large surface area for air cooling can present problems such as difficulties manufacturing the shapes needed for good heat transfer and the space needed for free flow of a large volume of air. Water boils {{at about the same}} temperature desired for engine cooling. This has the advantage that it absorbs a great deal of energy with very little rise in temperature (called heat of vaporization), which is good for keeping things cool, especially for passing one stream of coolant over several hot objects and achieving uniform temperature. In contrast, passing air over several hot objects in series warms the air at each step, so the first may be over-cooled and the last under-cooled. However, once water boils, it is an insulator, leading to a sudden loss of cooling where steam bubbles form (for more, see heat transfer). Steam may return to water as it mixes with other coolant, so an <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> can indicate an acceptable temperature even though local temperatures are high enough that damage is being done.|$|E
50|$|The Cutlass Ciera was updated for 1989, {{with the}} sedan {{receiving}} a modern roofline (similar to the coupe), and revised bodyside moldings. Hood ornaments were gone, {{as the new}} model featured less chrome trim than before {{in an effort to}} appear more up-to-date as a competitor to Ford's successful Taurus. Rear seat shoulder belts were added. Both coupe and sedan models wore updated rear-end treatments (the 1989/1990 taillights were Oldsmobile-themed — squared with a center emblem, and 1991 to 1996 models held a three horizontal-sectioned taillight lens). For 1990, the front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. This would also be the last year for the 'International Series'. The changes for 1991 included a new instrument cluster with a trip odometer and an <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> For 1992, the coupe was dropped, and the line-up included only sedans and wagons in 'S' or 'SL' designations. The wagon now had some internal competition {{in the form of the}} new Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan (itself based on the Cutlass Ciera's A-platform), offering buyers a choice of traditional station wagon or a multi-configurable minivan. Despite the all-new Olds Achieva and Delta 88 models for 1992, Cutlass Ciera was still Oldsmobile's best-selling model line, with over 132,000 sedans and an additional 7,793 wagons produced this year. For 1993, the 2.5 L Tech IV engine was replaced by the 2.2 L OHV engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|The Bedford CA was {{designed}} {{in an era}} when semi-conductor devices were state-of-the-art, and not affordable for automotive applications. Water temperature was thus measured mechanically, via a capillary tube connected to capsule containing a volatile liquid. The capsule was screwed into the body of the water pump. As the <b>engine</b> coolant <b>temperature</b> increases, the volatile liquid expands, altering the pressure on a mechanical linkage in the water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> which moves the position of the needle. Later models used an electric gauge.|$|R

50|$|The {{dashboard}} is lit using electroluminescent {{panels in}} the gauge pods {{and on a}} call-out strip across the dash. This system did not use bulbs; instead, an inverter and transformer raised the battery voltage to over 100 volts AC and passed that high voltage through special plastic layers, causing the gauges to glow with a blue-green light. Instead of a water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> the Chrysler Turbine has a Turbine Inlet <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> with numbers 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
