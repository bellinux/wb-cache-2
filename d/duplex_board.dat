5000|$|Nine Dragons Paper (Holdings) Limited (...) is {{a privately}} owned paper {{manufacturing}} company in Mainland China, {{engaging in the}} manufacturing of containerboard products which include linerboard, <b>duplex</b> <b>board</b> as well as pulp. Its CEO and largest shareholder is Ms. Zhang Yin.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{industries}} such as Aarti Industires Ltd, Supreet Chemicals, {{and textile}} giants such as Alok industries, Welspun Terry Towels, Century Textiles, GHCL and Raymonds Limited have strong presences in Vapi and nearby areas. Bayer Vapi Pvt Ltd,United Phosphorus Ltd., Supreet Chemicals Pvt Ltd., Sarna Chemicals, Sangir Plastics, Kampun Polymers, Lathia Rubbers, Aarti Industries Ltd., Themis Industries and Hubergroup India Pvt Ltd (formerly Micro Inks Limited), Unique Star Alliance Tools Mfg. Pvt. Ltd. operate manufacturing plants in Vapi. Today, about 70% of the total industries in the township are chemical plants, mainly for chemical distillation {{and the production of}} pesticides, dyes, dye intermediaries and paints. Other major industries include paper, packaging, pharmaceuticals, plastics, rubber, textiles, wood, computer hardware and software, engineering workshops, glass, and food products. Another striking feature of Vapi is the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (or CETP). This is the largest of its kind in Asia and one of India's biggest effluent treatment plants in terms of capacity, treating the pollutants from these industries before the effluent is released into the river. The CETP is run by Vapi Waste and Effluent Management Company, promoted by the Vapi Industries Association. Vapi has the maximum number of Kraft paper & <b>duplex</b> <b>board</b> paper mills in India. The best quality paper producers are located in Vapi and to have more than 20 kraft paper mills within a distance of 20 km. Therefore, Vapi is also known as [...] "paper hub".|$|E
40|$|Solid Bleached Sulphate <b>Boards</b> (SBS) and <b>Duplex</b> <b>Boards</b> are {{commonly}} used substrates for various carton based packaging applications. Both types of boards were printed with Web Offset Printing Press available in local market keeping in target to check printing characteristics i. e. Solid Ink Density, Dot Gain and Print Contrast. A master consisting of quality control patches was prepared, printed and evaluated for above mentioned print characteristics {{with the help of}} spectrodensitometer. The results indicated that Solid Bleached Sulphate Boards are better than <b>Duplex</b> <b>boards</b> in terms of Solid Ink Density and Dot Gain. On the other hand, <b>Duplex</b> <b>boards</b> are better than in term ofPrint Contrast...|$|R
50|$|Victor Hugo Mathushek {{continued}} to develop designs like his grandfather's, and received patents for soundboard construction in 1891 (the <b>duplex</b> sounding <b>board)</b> and 1895, and metallic frames in 1896.|$|R
5000|$|Fault {{tolerance}} {{is built}} into VOS from the bottom up. On a hardware level, major devices are run in lockstepped duplex mode, meaning {{that there are two}} identical devices performing the same action at the same time. (In addition, each device, or <b>board,</b> is also <b>duplexed</b> in order to identify internal board failures at a hardware level, which is why Stratus hardware can be defined as [...] "lock stepped".) These boards are actively monitored by the operating system which can correct any minor inconsistencies (such as bad disk-writes or reads). Any boards which report an unacceptable number of faults are removed from service by the system; the <b>duplexed</b> <b>board</b> will continue operation until the problem is resolved via a hot-fix. This includes CPUs, disk drives, and any other device that can logically be duplexed (which by definition, excludes communications devices). The system will continue processing as normal and will automatically raise a fault ticket with Stratus Customer Service via RSN (the Remote Service Network). Stratus Customer Service will then dial into the system using RSN to investigate the problem and dispatch replacement parts.|$|R
40|$|The {{communications}} subsystem of {{a spacecraft}} is typically a SWaP (size, weight, and power) intensive subsystem in a SWaP constrained environment {{such as a}} CubeSat. Use of a satellite-based communication system, such as GlobalStars duplex GSP- 1720 radio is a low SWaP potentially game-changing low-cost communication subsystem solution that was evaluated for feasibility for the NASA Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator (PTD) project. The PTD project {{is a series of}} 6 U CubeSat missions to flight demonstrate and characterize novel small satellite payloads in low Earth orbit. GlobalStar is a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for satellite phone and low-speed data communications, and the GSP- 1720 is their single <b>board</b> <b>duplex</b> radio most commonly used in satellite phones and shipment tracking devices. The PTD project tested the GSP- 1720 to characterize its viability for flight using NASA GEVS (General Environmental Verification Standard) vibration and thermal vacuum levels, as well as testing the uplink-downlink connectivity, data throughput, and file transfer capabilities. This presentation will present the results of the environmental and capability testing of the GSP- 1720 performed at NASA Ames Research Center, as well as the viability for CubeSat use in LEO...|$|R
