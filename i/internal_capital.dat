This paper utilizes the information collected in the Federal Reserve Board’s 1993 and 1998 Small Business Finance Surveys to investigate the acquisition of additional equity capital by small firms. While {{the importance}} of public issue markets and venture capital investment in promoting the growth of small dynamic firms cannot be denied, {{the importance of}} external equity capital seems to be overstated. Only a very small number of small firms acquired additional external equity capital. It is the <b>internal</b> equity <b>capital,</b> not external, equity, that is one of the major financing sources for most small firms. We found that younger, lower quality firms were more likely to acquire additional <b>internal</b> equity <b>capital</b> than other firms. There appeared to be a “pecking order” of borrowing from internal sources to traditional lenders to non-traditional lenders. In addition, <b>internal</b> equity <b>capital</b> and debt acquired from traditional and non-traditional lenders appeared to be complementary financial resources. Copyright Springer 2006...|$|R

We find that industries display a considerable amount of complementarity, with some industries being complementary across all obstacles. We also find that the lack <b>internal</b> human <b>capital</b> (skilled personnel) is complementary to all the other obstacles in almost all industries. In this sense, our results suggest that <b>internal</b> human <b>capital</b> is key for any innovation policy, insofar that it is complementary to all the other factors that might hamper innovation activities...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{conglomerates}} face frictions in external capital markets has implications for their <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. We find that, during recessions, when external financing costs are higher, conglomerates improve the efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>capital</b> markets by increasing the allocation of funds to high q divisions relative to low q divisions. The improvement is significantly higher for conglomerates {{that are likely to}} face more binding financial constraints. This evidence suggests that although financial constraints impair managers' ability to undertake positive net present value projects, they improve the quality of project selection by reducing free cash flow and pressuring managers to fund the more valuable investment opportunities.
