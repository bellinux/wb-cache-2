50|$|Also {{known as}} the Norcross {{viscometer}} after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device {{is based on a}} piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space which is formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain thixotropic liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as <b>efflux</b> <b>cup),</b> Saybolt universal second (SUS) or centipoise.|$|E
50|$|The Marsh funnel {{viscometer}} measures viscosity {{from the}} time (efflux time) it takes a known volume of liquid to flow {{from the base of}} a cone through a short tube. This is similar in principle to the flow <b>cups</b> (<b>efflux</b> <b>cups)</b> like the Ford, Zahn and Shell cups which use different shapes to the cone and various nozzle sizes. The measurements can be done according to ISO 2431, ASTM D1200 - 10 or DIN 53411.|$|R
50|$|On paint {{standard}} specifications, one denotes viscosity in this manner: <b>efflux</b> time, Zahn <b>cup</b> number.|$|R
