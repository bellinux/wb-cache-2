5000|$|In {{the second}} half of 2002, many <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> {{enterprises}} in the country started to go under. These enterprises were not authorized deposit taking institutions under the Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law, but nevertheless accepted deposits by using the loophole of naming the depositors “shareholders.” They promised investors considerably higher interest rates than what private banks were offering (usually around 10% per year.). While these high rates, regularly reaching 3-4% per month, seemed hardly possible to return on a sustainable basis, large amount of investors used these entities nevertheless. More often than not, the enterprises depended on either highly speculative investments for the promised rate of return or even sometimes turned out to be not much more than ponzi schemes. Nevertheless, the collapse of the <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> companies {{is considered one of the}} early triggers of the crises. Not only were some of the authorized banks experienced direct financial loss because of exposure to these enterprises through lending and share investments, it also brought about distrust in the still newly liberalized financial sector.|$|E

This paper aims to deepen understanding of financial service demand by learning from <b>informal</b> <b>finance.</b> Based on economic anthropology, our analysis shows that microfinance does not substitute <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> for many reasons: because money and <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> are multidimensional and context specific; because the boundary between saving and borrowing is blurred; because money circulates in small quantities and quickly in village economies; because <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> is more flexible; and, last but not least, because <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> is a vector of social inclusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} trade credit of Chinese corporations. Previous studies have {{presented}} various {{views on the}} utilization of trade credit. One study argued that nonstate- owned firms utilized more trade credit than state-owned firms. Meanwhile, another study suggested that non-state-owned firms depended on <b>informal</b> <b>financing</b> channels rather than on trade credit. What is the actual financing pattern of Chinese corporations? To answer this question，we employ a large database of Chinese corporations and conduct comparative analyses between two groups: state-owned firms and non-state-owned firms. Statistical investigations reveal two findings. First, our empirical results demonstrate a higher utilization of trade credit for state-owned firms in contrast to ap revious study. Second, we conclude that non-state-owned firms rely on <b>informal</b> <b>financing</b> channels due to asymmetric informatio...|$|R
40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} businesses face obstacles in attracting low cost finance {{due to their}} less transparent nature in comparison with companies listed on the stock exchange. One of the alternatives for small {{and medium-sized}} businesses being able to obtain access to capital is through personal relationships and <b>informal</b> channels of <b>financing.</b> In Confucionist societies, guanxi (a social construct centered on the family) plays a preponderant role, facilitating interaction between companies and people. The literature, however, has not included significant studies on the influence of guanxi on <b>informal</b> <b>financing</b> in western societies. The objective {{of this article is to}} verify the impact of guanxi on entrepreneurs on the capacity of their {{small and medium-sized businesses}} accessing financial resources informally. To this end, data collected from Chinese entrepreneurs active in the principal business center of Brazil were used. From non-parametric tests, the principal results suggest that: i) different levels of guanxi allow small and medium-sized businesses to obtain informal access to financial resources, even operating in a non-Confucionist western society; ii) different types of <b>informal</b> <b>financing</b> are most used, or judged to be more significant, depending on the level of guanxi of the entrepreneur in terms of parental and non-family ties; iii) unlike the western literature on the financial cycles of start ups, the significance of the types of <b>informal</b> <b>financing</b> can extend beyond the initial stage of the business. The relevance of this article is based on the study of the impact of guanxi on the ability of small and medium-sized businesses to attract capital when operating outside of Confucionist societies.

First, I present the characteristics of <b>informal</b> <b>finance,</b> focusing on size, structure, and scope of activities. <b>Informal</b> <b>finance</b> has not been very attractive for the private sector. Indeed, the informal sector has considerable experience and knowledge about dealing with small borrowers, but there are significant limitations to what it can lend to growing microbusinesses. Second, I discuss some recent trends in microfinance. While externally driven microfinance projects have sur-faced in Africa, their performance relative to small business finance has not been as positive as in Asia and Latin America. Third, I introduce some possible steps toward a new reform agenda that will make informal and microfinance relevant to private sector development, including focusing on links among formal, semi-for-mal and <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> and how these links can be developed. In this section I explore the characteristics of informal financethat make it difficult for it to be accessed by Sub-SaharanAfrican enterprises. “Informal finance ” might be defined as embracing all financial transactions taking place beyond various countries ’ regulations on banking and other financial sectors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} endeavours to {{shed light}} on the paradox of the persistence of <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> in urban African markets despite the emergence of a vibrant microfinance sector. To do so, it analyses the rationale of the financial choices of the micro-entrepreneurs operating in the markets of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). In particular, a careful examination of the motives driving the combinative use of informal and formal microfinance is carried. In order to lay deep theoretical foundations to this analysis, this thesis develops a model describing the financial behaviour of the micro-entrepreneurs in the presence of hyperbolic preferences and social influences. The solution of this model shows, inter alia, that the financial choices are not solely driven by economic motivations but also by social motivations. This result is confirmed by empirical observations which show, among other things, that social relations {{play an important role in}} explaining the persistence of <b>informal</b> <b>finance.</b> Besides, it appeared also that the combinative use of <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> and microfinance can be explained, on the one side, by the fact that the motives driving the demand for informal and for formal finance are not always the same and, on the other side, by the fact that these two types of financial mechanisms are more likely to be used as complements than as substitutes. Ultimately, this thesis unfolds a new perspective for apprehending the coexistence of informal and formal microfinance. <b>Informal</b> <b>finance</b> is no longer considered as a makeshift, but as an integral part of the financial landscape of the Sub-Saharan urban financial markets. Therefore, microfinance institutions and policy makers ought to adopt a more positive and pro-active attitude vis-à-vis <b>informal</b> <b>finance.</b> (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

A central prediction is that such finance, while breeding trust, deters risk taking. Demand is thus constrained: entrepreneurs may forgo risky investment rather than finance it through family and friends. Formal finance is valuable precisely because it is regulated only by contract. The highlighted trade-offs between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>finance</b> are potentially relevant for the provision of microventure capital. ...|$|E

This external finance comes from formal sources, such as commercial banks (59. 65 %) and informal sources (40. 35 %), such as trade creditors, or family and friends.

The business environment, for example, low social trust and high product market competition, also strengthen the positive relationship between managers– professional connections and firms– access to trade credit.
