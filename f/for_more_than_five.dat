5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa in 1950, Harvey {{was offered a}} job in captain Lindsay Hassett's sports store. Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket. Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment. He was paid £300 a year, but nevertheless lived at home and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married, due to poverty. He used the same cricket uniforms <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Moving up from Chambois, the Polish 1st Armoured Division's {{reconnaissance}} regiment made {{an attempt}} to reach their comrades on Point 262N but was mistakenly fired upon by the ridge's defenders. The regiment withdrew after losing two Cromwell tanks. At 12:00 a Polish forward patrol from the ridge encountered the Canadian vanguard near Point 239. The Canadian Grenadier Guards reached the ridge just over an hour later, having fought <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> hours and accounted for two Panthers, a Panzer IV, and two self-propelled guns along their route.

5|$|Neville {{inherited}} {{lands in}} Lincolnshire worth {{one half of}} a knight's fee. These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John, much of which were in Essex. He also acquired lands in Surrey and in Somerset, and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex.

Joan and her sister were also co-heiresses to the barony of Courcy, in right of their mother Alice de Courcy.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{made his}} {{television}} debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage {{role of the}} chief engineer in Bees on the Boatdeck. His last stage part in the 1930s was Robert Johnson, an Everyman figure, in Priestley's Johnson Over Jordan directed by Basil Dean. It was an experimental piece, using music (by Benjamin Britten) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but which did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did not act on stage <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were lost <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> centuries, believed to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the Richard III Society on a city council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's remains were reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E

In 1901, after being stateless <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life.

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the {{southern}} state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.|$|E
5|$|The way {{the game}} unfolded, Kippax had little {{responsibility}} with the bat. A record partnership of 451 between Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman meant that Australia was four for 574 {{by the time}} he got to the crease. Kippax made 28 in just under an hour as Australia amassed 701runs. He scored just 8 in the second innings, but Australia were victorious by 562runs and regained the Ashes. Six days later, Kippax celebrated by making 250 against the Sussex bowling attack, his highest score in England and his first double century <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years. This boosted his first-class above 50 on what had been a tour of mixed fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Vamei {{developed}} in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of Borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography. Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and {{in an analysis of}} 51winters, only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665km (415mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400years.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{was less}} {{involved}} with the legislative process than previous governors. For example, he {{did not attempt to}} influence the choice of legislative leadership, while most previous governors had practically hand-selected the presiding officers in each house. During one of the two legislative sessions of his term, he went on vacation. Consequently, many of his legislative recommendations were not enacted. Among his failed proposals were a multi-county banking law, a flat rate income tax, professional negotiations for teachers, and a constitutional amendment to allow a governor to be elected to successive terms. In all, Brown was out of the state – leaving Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor – <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> hundred days during his four-year term. As noted by Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison, Brown's hands-off approach allowed the legislature to gain power relative to the governor {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history, a trend which continued into the terms of his successors.|$|E
5|$|Harvey worked <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> decades for {{the same}} {{engineering}} firm, and lived with his wife Myrtle in the western industrial suburb of Footscray.

Robert made his Australian Football League debut for St Kilda Football Club in 1988 and played 21 seasons. He {{was a member of the}} All-Australian team eight times and won the Brownlow Medal twice, in 1997 and 1998, for the best and fairest player. Robert played for Victoria at Under-19 level as a bowler, but he was already playing top-flight football at the time and gave up his cricket career after the national Under-19 tournament. Another grandson Anthony, the younger brother of Robert, also played for St Kilda and captained Norwood to the 1997 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) premiership.|$|E
5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
