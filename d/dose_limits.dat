25|$|PELs for {{short-term}} and career astronaut exposure to space radiation {{have been approved}} by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer. The PELs set requirements and standards for mission design and crew selection as recommended in NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1. NASA has used <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for cancer risks and the non-cancer risks to the BFOs, skin, and lens since 1970. For Exploration mission planning, preliminary <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for the CNS risks are based largely on experimental results with animal models. Further research is needed to validate and quantify these risks, however, and to refine the values for <b>dose</b> <b>limits.</b> The CNS PELs, which correspond to the doses at the region of the brain called the hippocampus, are set for time periods of 30 days or 1 year, or for a career with values of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mGy-Eq, respectively. Although the unit mGy-Eq is used, the RBE for CNS effects is largely unknown; therefore, the use of the quality factor function for cancer risk estimates is advocated. For particles with charge Z>10, an addition PEL requirement limits the physical dose (mGy) for 1 year and the career to 100 and 250 mGy, respectively. NASA uses computerized anatomical geometry models to estimate the body self-shielding at the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{amounts of}} {{low-level}} waste are produced through chemical and volume control system (CVCS). This includes gas, liquid, and solid waste produced {{through the process}} of purifying the water through evaporation. Liquid waste is reprocessed continuously, and gas waste is filtered, compressed, stored to allow decay, diluted, and then discharged. The rate at which this is allowed is regulated and studies must prove that such discharge does not violate <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> to a member of the public (see radioactive effluent emissions).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced {{pancreatic}} cancer has a poor prognosis, {{and the current}} standard of care (gemcitabine based chemotherapy) provides a small survival advantage. However the drawback is the accompanying systemic toxicity, which targeted treatments may overcome. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KAb 201, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody, labelled with I 131 in {{pancreatic cancer}} (ISRCTN 16857581). Methods Patients with histological/cytological proven inoperable adenocarcinoma {{of the head of}} pancreas were randomised to receive KAb 201 via either the intra-arterial or intravenous delivery route. The <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicities within each group were determined. Patients were assessed for safety and efficacy and followed up until death. Results Between February 2003 and July 2005, 25 patients were enrolled. Nineteen patients were randomised, 9 to the intravenous and 10 to the intra-arterial arms. In the intra-arterial arm, <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicity was seen in 2 / 6 (33 %) patients at 50 mCi whereas in the intravenous arm, <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicity was noted in 1 / 6 patients at 50 mCi, but did not occur at 75 mCi (0 / 3). The overall response rate was 6 % (1 / 18). Median overall survival was 5. 2 months (95 % confidence interval = 3. 3 to 9 months), with {{no significant difference between the}} intravenous and intra-arterial arms (log rank test p = 0. 79). One patient was still alive at the time of this analysis.

5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final ruleâ€™s <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|R
5000|$|Committed {{effective}} dose, E(t) {{is the sum}} of {{the products}} of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors WT, where t is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children. This refers specifically to the dose to the whole body, in the similar way to external effective dose. The committed effective dose is used to demonstrate compliance with <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> and is entered into the [...] "dose of record" [...] for occupational exposures used for recording, reporting and retrospective demonstration of compliance with regulatory <b>dose</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to the ICRP, {{the main}} uses of {{effective}} dose are the prospective dose assessment {{for planning and}} optimisation in radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> for regulatory purposes.

40|$|Beam loss {{criterion}} for beam dynamics simulation {{is derived from}} the dose rate level which will allow hands-on maintenance. In this short paper we define a new beam loss {{criterion for}} SARAF SC (Super Conducting) linac based on the hands-on maintenance criterion used successfully for maintenance of high energy high intensity proton linacs. According to the high intensity proton linacs facilities working experience, we suggest a realistic <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for the SARAF which will allow hands-on maintenance. At this approach the annual <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for design (define as 1 / 10 of the annual <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for worker, 2000 mrem), will be taken into account at the maintenance program of the linac. We also repeated the residual activity calculation along the SC linac with novel experimental cross sections. Based on this analysis we suggest that the beam loss criterion will vary along the SC linac to keep the dose rate below 10 mrem/h. In this new definition the beam loss criterion is around 200 nA/m in the MEBT and decreases to 1 nA/m at 40 MeV...|$|R

40|$|The {{recommendation}} from the International Commission on Radiological Protection that the occupational equivalent <b>dose</b> <b>limit</b> for {{the lens of}} the eye should be reduced to 20 [*]mSv yearâˆ’ 1, averaged over 5 years with no year exceeding 50 [*]mSv, has stimulated a discussion on the practicalities of implementation of this revised <b>dose</b> <b>limit,</b> and the most appropriate risk and protection framework to adopt. This brief paper provides an overview of some of the drivers behind the move to a lower recommended <b>dose</b> <b>limit.</b> The issue of implementation in the medical sector in the UK has been addressed through a small-scale survey of doses to {{the lens of the}} eye amongst interventional cardiologists and radiologists. In addition, a mechanistic study of early and late post-irradiation changes in the lens of the eye in in-vivo-exposed mice is outlined. Surveys and studies such as those described can contribute to a deeper understanding of fundamental and practical issues, and therefore contribute to a robust evidence base for ensuring adequate protection of the eye while avoiding undesirable restrictions to working practices...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Crotoxin has a broad {{antitumor}} activity but {{has shown}} frequent neurotoxic toxicity. To induce tolerance and limit this toxicity, we propose a new design with intra-patient dose escalation. Methods: A new <b>Dose</b> <b>Limiting</b> Toxicity definition was used. The concept of Target Ceiling Dose was introduced. Results: <b>Dose</b> <b>Limiting</b> Toxicity was {{the inability to}} dose escalate twice. Target Ceiling Dose was the highest planned dose to be administered to a patient and could change for patients along time. Recommended Dose was defined similarly as in a (3 Â +Â  3) conventional design. Conclusion: This innovant design was used and the clinical trial is now closed for inclusions. Results will be presented later...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> toxicity (DLT), and the pharmacokinetic profile (Pk) of bendamustine (BM) on a day 1 and 2 every 3 weeks schedule and to recommend a safe phase II dose for further testing. Patients with solid tumours beyond standard therapy were eligible. A 30 -min intravenous infusion of BM was administered d 1 +d 2 q 3 weeks. The starting dose was 120 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 per day and dose increments of 20 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 were used. Plasma and urine samples were analysed using validated high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence assays. Fifteen patients were enrolled. They received a median of two cycles (range 1 â€“ 8). The MTD was reached at the fourth dose level. Thrombocytopaenia (grade 4) was <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> in two of three patients at 180 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2. One patient also experienced febrile neutropaenia. Lymphocytopaenia (grade 4) was present in every patient. Nonhaematologic toxicity including cardiac toxicity was not <b>dose</b> <b>limiting</b> with this schedule. Mean plasma Pk values of BM were tmax 35 [*]min, t 1 / 2 49. 1 [*]min, Vd 18. 3 [*]l[*]mâˆ’ 2, and clearance 265 [*]ml[*]minâˆ’ 1 [*]mâˆ’ 2. The mean total amount of BM and its metabolites recovered in the first micturition was 8. 3 % (range 2. 7 â€“ 26 %). The MTD of BM in the present dose schedule was 180 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 on day 1 + 2.

50|$|While {{the most}} significant, but highly unlikely, health {{consequences}} to atmospheric radiation exposure include death from cancer due to long-term exposure, many lifestyle-degrading and career-impacting cancer forms can also occur.

International guidelines from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) {{have been developed to}} mitigate this statistical risk. The ICRP recommends effective <b>dose</b> <b>limits</b> of a 5-year average of 20 mSv per year with no more than 50 mSv in a single year for non-pregnant, occupationally exposed persons, and 1 mSv per year for the general public.
