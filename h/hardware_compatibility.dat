25|$|The AllCard, an add-on memory {{management}} unit for XT-class computers, allowed normal memory to be mapped into the A0000-EFFFF (hex) address range, giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed video memory directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed {{at the cost of}} <b>hardware</b> <b>compatibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with <b>hardware</b> <b>compatibility</b> issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E

500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and <b>hardware</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} RTM {{release of}} Windows10 ("Windows10, released in July 2015") receives mainstream support {{for five years}} after its original release, followed by five years of extended support, but this is subject to conditions. Microsoft's support lifecycle policy for the operating system notes that [...] "Updates are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it", that [...] "a device needs to install the latest update to remain supported", and that a device's ability to receive future updates will depend on <b>hardware</b> <b>compatibility,</b> driver availability, and whether the device is within the OEM's [...] "support period"a new aspect not accounted for in lifecycle policies for previous versions. This policy was first invoked in 2017 to block Intel Clover Trail devices from receiving the Creators Update, as Microsoft asserts that future updates [...] "require additional hardware support {{to provide the best}} possible experience", and that Intel no longer provided support or drivers for the platform. Microsoft stated that these devices would no longer receive feature updates, but would still receive security updates through January 2023.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2009, SanDisk {{released}} a redesign of the Sansa Clip called the Sansa Clip+, cosmetically {{similar to the}} Clip and maintaining its basic design, audio <b>hardware,</b> <b>compatibility,</b> and 4-line OLED screen, but with a few significant differences. There are 2GB (black), 4GB (black, red, blue, white or indigo) and 8GB (black) models. The case has been redesigned to look more square (including the navigation pad, which is also no longer backlit) and is constructed of higher-quality plastic, the clip is no longer removable, and the player now supports folder browsing and ReplayGain support. Transition times between tracks was reduced, but Sandisk officially declined to support gapless playback. A microSDHC card slot has been added, allowing the storage capacity of the device to be expanded by up to an additional 32GB. The Clip+ also has added features when playing slotMusic and slotRadio. To {{make room for the}} microSDHC slot there have been some changes from the old Clip, including moving the volume switch to {{the left side of the}} device and changing the power/hold switch to a simple power button. Hold mode is now activated by holding the [...] "Home" [...] button on the device. Like previous Clip and Fuze products, the Clip+ retained a directly coupled headphone amplifier, allowing for highly accurate reproduction of bass frequencies and very low distortion on difficult to drive headphones.|$|E

25|$|The PlayStation 3 was {{originally}} launched in Japan on November 11, 2006 and in North America on November 17, 2006 with two SKUs: a 20 GB version and a 60 GB version. Both {{of these models}} included <b>hardware</b> backwards <b>compatibility</b> for PlayStation 2 games. In January 2007, Sony announced that Europe's 60 GB version would exclude <b>hardware</b> backwards <b>compatibility</b> for PS2 titles and instead would provide compatibility through software emulation of the PS2's hardware. During the course of 2007, Sony announced several new PlayStation 3 SKUs and discontinued others. The new 40 GB, 80 GB and 160 GB PlayStation 3 models do not feature software emulation of PlayStation 2 hardware. In August 2009, all previous models were discontinued, as the new PS3 Slims were released, in 120GB and 250GB editions, priced at $299 and $349, respectively. One year later, in August 2010, the 120GB version went out of production, {{to be replaced by}} a 160GB counterpart, which was also priced at $299.|$|R

50|$|For {{a digital}} {{processor}} implemented in <b>hardware,</b> binary <b>compatibility</b> means that (a large subset of) machine code produced for another processor can be correctly executed and has (much) {{the same effect}} as on the other processor. This is quite common among many processor families, although it is rather uncommon among the ubiquitous small embedded systems built around such processors. Full machine code compatibility would here imply exactly the same layout of interrupt service routines, I/O-ports, hardware registers, counter/timers, external interfaces and so on. For a more complex embedded system using more abstraction layers (sometimes on the border to a general computer, such as a mobile phone), this may be different.|$|R

50|$|The {{important}} {{advantage of}} the EFM32 MCU portfolio is energy efficiency. The energy efficiency stems from autonomous operations in deep sleep modes, low active and sleep currents, and fast wakeup times. Together, these characteristics reduce the integrated energy (power over time) over the lifetime of an application. EFM32 devices are also constructed to reduce development cycles {{for a variety of}} products, from smart metering to industrial applications and more. They are pin/software compatible, scalable across wide application requirements, and are compatible with multiple development platforms. Additionally, because the MCU architecture is the common fundamental piece of the wireless Gecko portfolio (EFR32) with both software and <b>hardware</b> (pin/package) <b>compatibility,</b> the EFM32 products offer a simplified pathway to wireless applications.|$|R
