This spirit of bondage, this slavish terror, instead of bringing us nearer to God, only drives us farther from Him. It does not make us hate what is wrong, it only makes us dread the punishment of it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was born}} a yellow pup; date, locality, {{pedigree}} and weight unknown. The first thing I can recollect, an old woman had me in a basket at Broadway and Twenty-third trying to sell me to a fat lady. Old Mother Hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine Pomeranian-Hambletonian-Red-Irish-Cochin-China-Stoke-Pogis fox terrier. The fat lady chased a V around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it, and gave up. From that moment I was a pet--a mamma's own wootsey squidlums. Say, gentle reader, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> a 200-pound woman breathing a flavour of Camembert cheese and Peau d'Espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you, remarking {{all the time in}} an Emma Eames tone of voice: [...] "Oh, oo's um oodlum, doodlum, woodlum, toodlum, bitsy-witsy skoodlums?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Wallace's voice sank {{with the}} keen {{memory of that}} shame. [...] "I pretended not to hear," [...] he said. [...] "Well, then Carnaby {{suddenly}} called me a young liar and disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew {{where to find the}} green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes. [...] Carnaby became outrageously virtuous, and said I'd have to--and bear out my words or suffer. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> Carnaby twist your arm? Then perhaps you'll understand how it went with me. I swore my story was true. There was nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby though Crawshaw put in a word or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew excited and red-eared, and a little frightened, I behaved altogether like a silly little chap, and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the way presently--cheeks flushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one burning misery and shame--for a party of six mocking, curious and threatening school-fellows.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> such thoughts? But, did {{you find}} those thoughts, that slavish terror of God's wrath, that dread of hell, made you any BETTER men? I never did. I never saw them make any human being better. Unless you go beyond them--as far beyond them as heaven is beyond hell, as far above them as a free son is above a miserable {{crouching}} slave, they will do you more harm than good. For this is all that I have seen come of them: That all this spirit of bondage, this slavish terror, instead of bringing a man nearer to God, only drove him further from God. It did not make him hate what was wrong; it only made him dread the punishment of it. And then, when the first burst of fear cooled down, he began to say to himself: [...] "I can never atone for my sins. I can never win back God to love me. What is done, is done. If I cannot escape punishment, let me {{be at least as}} happy as I can while it lasts. If it does not come to-day, it will come to-morrow. Let me alone, thou tormenting conscience. Let me eat and drink, for to-morrow I die!" [...] And so back rushed the poor creature into all his wrong-doing again, and fell most probably deeper than ever into the mire, because a certain feeling of desperation and defiance rose up in him, till he began to fancy that his terror was all a dream--a foolish accidental rising up of old superstitious words which he learnt from his mother or his nurse; and he tried to forget it all, and did forget it--God help him!--and his latter end was worse than his first.|$|E

Then chances are your clients are not fully aligned and using the power and innate wisdom of their multiple brains – the brains in their head, heart and gut. You see, when coherently aligned, the head, heart and gut produce an incredible congruence and an emergent wisdom that allows people to deeply tap into intuitions and competencies that you simply can’t get from the head brain alone. This is the experience of multiple Brain Integration Technique Coaching (mBIT Coaching) {{and the process of}} mBraining. [...] . The importance of this to the fields of coaching, training and leadership is two-fold. First, it’s crucial that all three intelligences are accessed and incorporated into the decision-making process. Without the head intelligence, the decision will lack thorough analysis. Without the heart intelligence, there will be insufficient values-driven emotional energy to prioritise actions required. Without the gut intelligence there will be insufficient managing of risks and reduced motivation to persist against challenges...|$|R

6000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> such {{thoughts}} as those come over you, my friends, {{when you are}} thinking of the Lord Jesus, and praying to him? If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> shall I {{tell you what to}} say to them when they arise in your minds, 'Get thee behind me, Satan.' Get thee away, thou accusing devil, who art accusing my Lord to me, and trying to make me fancy him less loving, less condescending, less tender, less understanding, than he was when he wept over the grave of Lazarus. Get thee away, thou lying hypocritical devil, who pretendest to be so very humble and reverent to the godhead of the Lord Jesus, in order that thou mayest make me forget what his godhead is like, forget what God's likeness is, forget that it was in his manhood, in his man's words, his man's thoughts, his man's actions, that he shewed forth the glory of God, the express image of his person, and fulfilled the blessed words, 'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.' Get thee behind me, Satan. I believe in the good news of Easter Day, and thou shall not rob me of it. I believe that he who died upon the Cross, rose again the third day, as very and perfect man then and now, as he was when he bled and groaned on Calvary, and shuddered at the fear of death, in the garden of Gethsemane. Thou shalt not make my Lord's incarnation, his birth, his passion, his resurrection, all that he did and suffered in those thirty-three years, of none effect to me. Thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of my Bible, that there is a man in heaven {{in the midst of the}} throne of God. Thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of the Athanasian Creed, that in Christ the manhood is taken into God. Thou shalt not take from me the blessed message of Holy Communion, which declares that the very human flesh and blood of him who died on the Cross is now eternal in the heavens, and nourishes my body and soul to everlasting life. Thou shalt not, under pretence of voluntary humility and will-worship, tempt me to go and pray to angels or to saints, or to the Blessed Virgin, because I choose to fancy them more tender, more loving and condescending, more loving, more human, than the Lord himself, who gave himself to death for me. If the Lord God, the Son of the Father, is not ashamed to be man for ever and ever, I will not be ashamed to think of him as man; to pray to him as man; to believe and be sure that he can be touched with the feeling of my infirmities; to entreat him, by all that he did and suffered as a man, to deliver me from those temptations which he himself has conquered for himself; and to cry to him in the smallest, as well as in the most important matters--'By the mystery of thy holy incarnation; by thine agony and bloody sweat; by thy cross and passion; by thy precious death and burial; by thy glorious resurrection and ascension;' by all which thou hast done, and suffered, and conquered, as a man upon this earth of ours, good Lord, deliver us! ...|$|R
