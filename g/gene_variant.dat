5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing <b>gene</b> <b>variant</b> (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each <b>gene</b> <b>variant,</b> which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

40|$|Aims/Introduction. To collectively {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} haptoglobin (Hp) <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods. A comprehensive literature review was performed for eligible studies. After inclusion and exclusion selection as well as quality assessment, those studies meeting quality standards were included. In this study, diabetic patients with retinopathy were selected as the case group and those ones without DR were treated as the control group. The recessive model, allele model, additive model, heterozygote model, and homozygote model were utilized to investigate the association of three Hp <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> and DR. Subgroup analysis on different severity of DR including nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) was also conducted. Results. Six trials from different regions were finally included. A total of 1145 subjects containing 564 T 2 DM patients with retinopathy were included. The recessive model, allele model, additive model, and homozygote model results showed that Hp <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> were not associated with DR, NPDR, and PDR. However, the heterozygote model indicated the association of Hp <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> with DR. Conclusions.

2500|$|As {{observed}} for hERG mutations, KCNE2 loss-of-function mutations {{are associated with}} inherited LQTS, and hERG-KCNE2 channels carrying the mutations show reduced activity compared to wild-type channels. [...] In addition, some KCNE2 mutations and also more common polymorphisms are associated with drug-induced LQTS. [...] In several cases, specific KCNE2 sequence variants increase the susceptibility to hERG-KCNE2 channel inhibition by the drug that precipitated the QT prolongation in the patient from which the <b>gene</b> <b>variant</b> was isolated. LQTS predisposes to potentially lethal ventricular cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de pointe, which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Moreover, KCNE2 gene variation can disrupt HCN1-KCNE2 channel function and this may potentially contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. KCNE2 is also associated with familial atrial fibrillation, which may involve excessive KCNQ1-KCNE2 current caused by KCNE2 gain-of-function mutations.|$|E
2500|$|Acetaldehyde, {{the first}} {{by-product}} of ethanol, is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption. In addition, certain genetic factors can amplify {{the negative effects}} of acetaldehyde. For example, some people (predominantely East Asians) have a mutation in their alcohol dehydrogenase gene that makes this enzyme unusually fast at converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. In addition, about half of all East Asians convert acetaldehyde to acetic acid more slowly (via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), causing a higher buildup of acetaldehyde than normally seen in other groups. The high concentration of acetaldehyde causes the alcohol flush reaction, colloquially known as the [...] "Asian Flush". Since the alcohol flush reaction is highly uncomfortable and the possibility of hangovers is immediate and severe, people with this <b>gene</b> <b>variant</b> are less likely to become alcoholics.|$|E

In rats, stimulation of central GLP- 1 receptors increases heart rate and activates autonomic regulatory neurons. We aimed to evaluate the potential role of TCF 7 L 2 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> on sympathovagal response in relation to changes in plasma insulin and/or GLP- 1 concentration following glucose ingestion. Genotyping was performed for rs 12255372 and rs 7903146 TCF 7 L 2 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> in 250 non related healthy volunteers. Consistent with previous reports, both SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D'= 0. 87, r 2 = 0. 76). A subset of 167 patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test while a continuous recording of Heart Rate Variability was performed. At baseline, no difference in fasting plasma insulin, in GLP- 1 levels and in LF/HF ratio between the three genotypes were found. Along with glucose ingestion TT subjects had lower INSAUC (insulin area under curve) as well as higher LF/HFAUC (low frequency/high frequency area under curve) values. No difference in GLP- 1 AUC between TCF 7 L 2 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> was found. A multivariate analysis showed that only INSAUC, GLP 1 AUC and TCF 7 L 2 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> were independently associated with LF/HFAUC. In conclusion TT genotype of rs 12255372 and rs 7903146 TCF 7 L 2 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> is associated with lower insulin secretion and higher cardiosympathetic activity. The effect is independent of GLP- 1 and insulin plasma concentrations suggesting a potential role of such <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> in increasing cardiovascular risk via enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is considered}} a major public health problem worldwide. Susceptibility to diabetes is influenced by both genetic and environmental determinants. Aims/hypothesis: The aim {{of the present study}} was to test for 16 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in established Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and obesity susceptibility loci by GWAS in a sample of Egyptian patients to find out if there is shared genetic background underlying both disease entities. Methods: Genotyping was performed using OpenArray® protocol on the QuantStudio™ 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System. In the present case control study a custom array was designed to facilitate cost-effective analysis of selected SNPs related to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, inflammation, insulin signalling, and immune function. Results: Seven <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> showed significant association with the risk of T 2 D patients including FCGRA 2, STAT 4, CELSR 2, PPARG, EXT 2 rs 3740878, GCKR, PTGS 1. Factors that significantly affect T 2 D were obesity (p <  0. 001) and GCKR (p =  0. 001) and PTGS 1 (p =  0. 001) <b>gene</b> <b>variants.</b> <b>Gene</b> <b>variants</b> that showed significant or borderline effect on obesity were MTHFD 1, EXT 2 rs 3740878, GCKR and PTGS 1 (p =  0. 03, 0. 017, 0. 059, 0. 006) respectively. Conclusions/interpretation: Overlapping genetic aspects should be considered and the presence of risk alleles of different genes together could contribute to the risk of T 2 D or obesity or both. The MTHFD 1 and EXT 2 rs 3740878 <b>gene</b> <b>variants</b> significantly affect obesity and not shared with T 2 D. <b>Gene</b> <b>variants</b> that showed combined effect on both disease entities were GCKR and PTGS 1. These findings provide a basis for future studies on a larger scale.
