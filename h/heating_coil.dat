25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to facilitate the}} use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second fuel tank for biodiesel {{in addition to the}} standard diesel fuel tank. The second fuel tank can be insulated and a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> using engine coolant is run through the tank. The fuel tanks can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.|$|E
25|$|It had a {{rear area}} {{where it could}} carry {{ammunition}}, since {{it could be used}} in ammunition dumps to carry ammunition around the dump. The M6 also was equipped with a winterization kit that included: an insulated battery box with a <b>heating</b> <b>coil,</b> a gasoline heater to heat the battery, and a petcock for the bottom of the fuel tank (for easy releasing of cold air and pressure from the gasoline tank).|$|E
25|$|Seawater {{is pumped}} into an evaporator, {{where it is}} boiled by a <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> Vapour {{produced}} is then compressed, raising its temperature. This heated vapour is used to heat the evaporator coils. Condensate from the coil outlet provides the fresh water supply. To start the cycle, an electric pre-heater is used to heat the first water supply. The main energy input to the plant is in mechanically driving the compressor, not as heat energy.|$|E

50|$|The Schmidt {{system used}} a sealed ultra-high-pressure circuit that simply {{transferred}} heat to a high-pressure circuit, {{by means of}} <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> inside a high-pressure boiler. If this latter was fed with ordinary water, scale could form {{on the outside of}} the <b>heating</b> <b>coils,</b> but it could not cause overheating because the ultra-HP tubes were quite capable of withstanding their internal steam temperature, though not the firebox flame temperature.|$|R
50|$|It {{functions}} {{by having}} two parallel tubes both containing gas and <b>heating</b> <b>coils.</b> The gases are examined {{by comparing the}} rate of loss of heat from the <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> into the gas. The coils are arranged in a bridge circuit so that resistance changes due to unequal cooling can be measured. One channel normally holds a reference gas and the mixture to be tested is passed through the other channel.|$|R
2500|$|After Swan {{developed}} the initial balloon tip, Ganz used Fronek's idea {{and added a}} small thermistor (temperature probe) about 3cm behind the tip. Either cold 10 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl) under 10° Celsius or room temperature (not as accurate) is injected into {{an opening in the}} right atrium. As this cooler fluid passes the tip thermistor, a very brief drop in the blood temperature is recorded. A recent variation in design is the incorporation of a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> on the catheter (30cm from the tip, residing in the atrium area) which [...] eliminates the cold fluid bolus, a major factor in human technique variation.|$|E
2500|$|Lombardi's Packers {{hosted the}} Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31, 1967 in the NFL Championship Game of 1967. This {{became known as}} the [...] "Ice Bowl" [...] because of the −13°F game time temperature. Lombardi had a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> {{underneath}} the field but on this day it was not functioning, some people believe that he turned it off on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game and down by 3 points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas 2 foot line. In the huddle, with the game on the line, Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. Quarterback Bart Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Lombardi told Starr to 'Run it! And let's {{get the hell out of}} here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and eventual victory.|$|E
