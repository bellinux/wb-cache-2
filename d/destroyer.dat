5|$|All of the E {{class were}} {{assigned}} to the 5th <b>Destroyer</b> Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1934. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships {{were assigned to}} the 6th <b>Destroyer</b> Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th <b>Destroyer</b> Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th <b>Destroyer</b> Flotilla of the Home Fleet.|$|E

Duncan returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939. She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month, and required repairs that lasted until July 1940.

25|$|Corvettes had {{adequate}} endurance for MOEF assignments, but {{the fuel}} economy of <b>destroyers</b> was poor at the speeds that convoys operated.

Wickes-class <b>destroyers</b> were useful for the Canadian WLEF and the American Iceland shuttle; but lacked endurance to stay with a trade convoy for the full distance covered by the MOEF Escort Groups. The Admiralty converted some V and W-class <b>destroyers</b> to long range escorts by removing the forward boiler and using the space for additional fuel tanks.|$|R
