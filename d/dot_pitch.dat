40|$|Surface {{patterning}} {{with different}} biological molecules {{is one of}} the critical steps in the complex procedure of combinatorial biochemical analysis used e. g. in proteomics or in diagnostics. High-density bioarrays can reduce the analysis time. The tiny <b>dot</b> <b>pitches</b> allow to diminish the array size and so the diffusion time, or to place more targets onto one surface. One approach to dispensing such high-density arrays is to use the sharp tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe like a fountain pen, which, when combined with the nanometric resolution of the AFM scanner, permits the deposition of small droplets with a high positioning accuracy [1]. A commercially available AFM probe made of silicon nitride consists of a flexible cantilever with a downwards-pointing hollow pyramidal tip at its free end. This probe can be modified with a FIB. Firstly an aperture is milled at the apex of the tip to permit the transfer of liquid from the probe to the sample (Fig. 1). The diameter of such apertures can be as small as 200 nm. Secondly, the reflective gold layer covering {{the upper part of the}} cantilever is removed locally, in and around the hollow tip. The gold layer can be made hydrophobic by chemical treatment, while the bare cantilever remains hydrophilic. This hydrophilic area acts as...|$|R

60|$|There were {{a number}} of <b>pitches</b> <b>dotted</b> about over the field, for there was always a touch of the London Park about it on Mid-Term Service Day. Adair, as captain of cricket, had {{naturally}} selected the best for his own match. It was a good wicket, Mike saw. As a matter of fact the wickets at Sedleigh were nearly always good. Adair had infected the groundsman with some of his own keenness, with the result that that once-leisurely official now found himself sometimes, with a kind of mild surprise, working really hard. At the beginning of the previous season Sedleigh had played a scratch team from a neighboring town on a wicket which, except for the creases, was absolutely undistinguishable from the surrounding turf, and behind the pavilion after the match Adair had spoken certain home truths to the groundsman. The latter's reformation had dated from that moment.|$|R
40|$|Research in perceptual {{decision}} making is dominated by paradigms that tap the visual system, such as the random-dot motion (RDM) paradigm. In this study, we investigated whether the behavioral signature of perceptual decisions in the auditory domain is similar to those observed in the visual domain. We developed an auditory version of the RDM task, in which tones correspond to <b>dots</b> and <b>pitch</b> corresponds to motion (the random-tone pitch task, RTP). In this task, participants have to decide quickly whether the pitch of a "sound cloud" of tones is moving up or down. Stimulus strength and speed-accuracy trade-off were manipulated. To describe the relationship between stimulus strength and performance, we fitted the proportional-rate diffusion model to the data. The results showed a close coupling between stimulus strength and the speed and accuracy of perceptual decisions in both tasks. Additionally, we fitted the full drift diffusion model (DDM) to the data and showed {{that three of the}} four participants had similar speed-accuracy trade-offs in both tasks. However, for the RTP task, drift rates were larger and nondecision times slower, suggesting that some DDM parameters might be dependent on stimulus modality (drift rate and nondecision time), whereas others might not be (decision bound). The results illustrate that the RTP task is suitable for investigating the dynamics of auditory perceptual choices. Future studies using the task might help to investigate modality-specific effects on {{decision making}} at both the behavioral and neuronal levels...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{possibility}} to use local laser chemical processing (LCP) boron dopings to create local back surface fields (LBSF) in a high efficiency p-type silicon solar cell structure. In order to create boron local back surface fields with LCP an alkaline aqueous boron solution was used. Our recent work shows the potential of this doping source to create local dopings with a surface concentration of about 10 20 cm - 3 and a doping depth of up to 1. 3 m. For {{the first time the}} successful application of boron LCP as LBSF for high efficiency solar cells is shown. The processed LCP-PERL (passivated emitter and rear locally diffused) solar cells show a maximum cell efficiency of = 20. 9 % and an absolute cell efficiency benefit of = 0. 3 - 0. 4 %abs. in comparison to the reference cells with undoped local rear contacts processed with water-LCP. The presented solar cells show the best cell efficiencies ever achieved with LCP dopings. For this study different LCP-parameters were varied such as the contact geometry (line openings and openings formed with a cascade of overlapping LCP <b>dots)</b> and the <b>pitch</b> of the rear side contact structure. The results show that the LCP boron doping process allows the fabrication of industrial feasible local back surface field structures with a line contact design for high efficiency p-type silicon solar cells...|$|R

50|$|Text {{quality was}} a {{recurring}} issue with dot-matrix printers. Near Letter Quality mode - informally specified as almost {{good enough to}} be used in a business letter - endowed dot-matrix printers with a simulated typewriter-like quality. By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution. For example, the Epson FX-86 could achieve a theoretical addressable dot-grid of 240 by 216 dots/inch using a print head with a vertical dot density of only 72 dots/inch, by making multiple passes of the print head for each line. For 240 by 144 dots/inch, the print head would make one pass, printing 240 by 72 dots/inch, then the printer would advance the paper by half of the vertical <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> (1/144 inch), then the print head would make a second pass. For 240 by 216 dots/inch, the print head would make three passes with smaller paper movement (1/3 vertical <b>dot</b> <b>pitch,</b> or 1/216 inch) between the passes. To cut hardware costs, some manufacturers merely used a double strike (doubly printing each line) to increase the printed text's boldness, resulting in bolder but still jagged text. In all cases, NLQ mode incurred a severe speed penalty. Not surprisingly, all printers retained one or more 'draft' modes for high-speed printing.|$|E

More of a desktop than laptop, it had a {{built-in}} high-resolution, active-matrix, 1-bit black & white, 9.8" [...] LCD with 640x400 resolution. Like the IIc Flat Panel, it was not backlit and required a bright light source to be used. A second generation model rectified that situation. Commencing with the PowerBook series, built-in LCD flat-panels became standard across the portable line, following an industry-wide evolution from grayscale to color and ranging from 9" [...] to 17". Two primary technologies were used, active matrix (higher quality and more expensive) and passive matrix displays (lower quality and cheaper). By 1998 all laptops would use the standard active-matrix color LCD with a standard average dimension of 13", except for the Newton products and eMate portables.
