5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving {{too small for}} <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County. In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station, and William H. MacInnis made it a platform of his mayoral candidacy. In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a common model organism.|$|E

5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E

5|$|The raid {{exposed the}} {{weaknesses}} of the Medway defences {{and led to the}} castle losing <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> an artillery fortification. New and stronger forts were built further downriver over the following two centuries, culminating in the construction of massive casemated forts such as Garrison Point Fort, Hoo, and Darnet Forts. Upnor Castle became a naval ammunition depot, storing great quantities of gunpowder, ammunition, and cannon to replenish the warships that came to Chatham for repair and resupply. It remained in military use until as late as 1945. The castle was subsequently opened to the public and is now an English Heritage property.|$|E

Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping into the harbor per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E

It became an important cultural centre for the Polish Jews with a Zionist youth movement relatively strong among the city's Jewish population.

5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley.

The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977.

5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed <b>its</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> an important {{town in the}} District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E
