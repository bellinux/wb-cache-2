40|$|This paper {{develops}} a modification to hydraulic damper to utilize its energy {{lose in the}} form of heat. During the working of actual hydraulic damper, when the suspension fluid is compressed inside the damper cylinder in order to absorb the vibration shocks,the frictional energy of the vehicle is dissipated as heat loss by the suspension fluid in order to minimise the effect of bumps and ridges in road. So in order to harness this power loss, we have developed an energy saving hydraulic damper by modifying the existing model of hydraulic damper. We create a separate flow path with rotating turbine parallel to the <b>damping</b> <b>cylinder</b> connecting the upper and lower end of damper. When the vehicle travels down from a bump, the coil spring compresses forcing the piston to push the suspension fluid upwards and this high pressure fluid travels through the flow path rotating the turbine which in turn runs the generator for power generation. A check valve is provided at the flow path end to prevent the fluid back flow. Thus the suspension fluid kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy by means of the turbine...|$|E
40|$|Symmetrical {{two-dimensional}} nozzles {{were designed}} for the supersonic wind-tunnel, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, using both analytical and semigraphical methods obtained from the theory of Characteristics. These nozzles, designed for an optimum running time of 30 seconds, at a Mach number of 2, 35. Boundary layer growth was considered by displacing the nozzle contours outwards by the equivalent displacement thickness, while keeping the vertical tunnel side walls parallel. The five pitot probe calibration results, taken through the central vertical plane in the tunnel test-section, showed Mach number standard deviations about the mean of 0, 638 % and 1, 004 % for the analytical and semi-graphical design respectively. These results compare Â·very favourably {{with those of other}} wind- tunnels. Without pressure recovery the critical flow pressure ratio through the tunnel for Mach 2, 35 nozzles, is 2, 53. Therefore it may be shown that the subsonic diffuser, and the silencer incorporated into it, is about 75 % efficient. The analysis and modification to the existing settling chamber control valve yielded improvements in performance. 1. The maximum fluctuation in settling chamber pressure was kept to within 5, 5 % for most operating conditions. 2. Critical valve response was achieved by applying a suitable bypass orifice to the <b>damping</b> <b>cylinder</b> - The valve settled down within one second after flow had been initiated.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the in-line and cross-flow vortex-induced vibrations {{of a long}} cylindrical tensioned beam, with length to diameter ratio L/D = 200, placed within a linearly sheared oncoming flow, using three-dimensional direct numerical simulation. The study is conducted at three Reynolds numbers, from 110 to 1100 based on maximum velocity, so as to include the transition to turbulence in the wake. The selected tension and bending stiffness lead to high-wavenumber vibrations, similar to those encountered in long ocean structures. The resulting vortex-induced vibrations consist of a mixture of standing and travelling wave patterns in both the in-line and cross-flow directions; the travelling wave component is preferentially oriented from high to low velocity regions. The in-line and cross-flow vibrations have a frequency ratio approximately equal to 2. Lock-in, the phenomenon of self-excited vibrations accompanied by synchronization between the vortex shedding and cross-flow vibration frequencies, occurs in the high-velocity region, extending across 30 % {{or more of the}} beam length. The occurrence of lock-in disrupts the spanwise regularity of the cellular patterns observed in the wake of stationary cylinders in shear flow. The wake exhibits an oblique vortex shedding pattern, inclined {{in the direction of the}} travelling wave component of the cylinder vibrations. Vortex splittings occur between spanwise cells of constant vortex shedding frequency. The flow excites the cylinder under the lock-in condition with a preferential in-line versus cross-flow motion phase difference corresponding to counter-clockwise, figure-eight orbits; but it <b>damps</b> <b>cylinder</b> vibrations in the non-lock-in region. Both mono-frequency and multi-frequency responses may be excited. In the case of multi-frequency response and within the lock-in region, the wake can lock in to different frequencies at various spanwise locations; however, lock-in is a locally mono-frequency event, and hence the flow supplies energy to the structure mainly at the local lock-in frequency.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and discusses {{the results of}} two distinct investigations. The first is a Direct Numerical Simulation investigation of prescribed transverse oscillations of a two-dimensional circular cylinder in a fluid flow of Reynolds number 100. The second involves the numerical simulation of the Vortex-Induced Vibrations of long riser pipes in the sub-critical Reynolds number regime, using a strip theory code that employed a Large Eddy Simulation model. Before commencing the long riser investigation the code was thoroughly benchmarked against data from appropriate prescribed cross-stream oscillation experiments; {{the results of that}} benchmarking work are also presented in this thesis. The principal objectives of the low Reynolds number Direct Numerical Simulations were to use prescribed oscillations to explain phenomena that have been observed in free oscillation experiments, and also to investigate the different levels and types of synchronisation that exist between the cylinder and its wake in a given amplitude-frequency domain. It was found that the contour of zero hydrodynamic excitation closely matches the response envelopes reported from experimental and numerical investigations of the transverse Vortex-Induced Vibrations of lightly <b>damped</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Furthermore, the zero contour inferred that the maximum amplitude of free cross-stream vibration is 0. 56 cylinder diameters in Reynolds number 100 flow, and the shape of the contour confirmed the existence of hystereses at low and high reduced velocities in free vibration. The present study also revealed two new coalesced shedding modes, here labelled Câ(2 S) and Câ(P+S), that differ in their formation mechanism from the known C(2 S) mode. In the benchmarking of the Large Eddy Simulation code at sub-critical Reynolds numbers a clear trend was observed in which the prediction of the flow physics was altered by changing the level of sub-grid scale turbulence dissipation in the codeâs Smagorinsky turbulence dissipation model. It was found that by carefully tuning the level of turbulent dissipation the code could deliver very good predictions of the key physical quantities important in Vortex-Induced Vibrations; namely the component of the lift coefficient at the oscillation frequency and the phase angle by which this lift coefficient leads the cylinder displacement. Regarding the simulations of the Vortex-Induced Vibrations of a long model riser, {{it has been shown that}} responses in high modes of vibration at harmonics of the displacement-dominant response frequency (at 3 and 5 times the cross-stream displacement dominant frequency in the cross-stream direction and at 2 and 3 times the in-line displacement dominant frequency in the in-line direction) can be important with regard to the curvature variation along the riser, and can therefore contribute very significantly to the overall fatigue damage rate experienced by a riser undergoing VIV. Comparisons with experimental data in terms of maximum and mean displacements and modes and frequencies of vibration, were generally good for both uniform and linearly sheared flow profiles. Furthermore, it was observed that the majority of the responses involved travelling waves, even when the flow profile was uniform.

40|$|The {{tethered}} cylinder may {{be considered}} {{an extension of the}} more familiar (and widely studied) freely oscillating cylinder. In particular, assuming that the tether does not provide significant mechanical damping it directly extends the work of Khalak and Williamson (1999), Govardhan and Williamson (2000) and Govardhan and Williamson (2003). In particular, as with a lightly <b>damped</b> oscillating <b>cylinder,</b> the tethered cylinder system exhibits a critical mass ratio, below which large amplitude oscillations are observed (Ryan et al. 2007). This critical mass ratio is observed to vary as a function of tether length. As part of their work, Ryan et al. (2007) observed a peak in maximum oscillation amplitude (for the particular case of m * = 0. 2) at a tether length ratio of L * â 2. 0. However, no explanation for this local maximum was presented therein. This paper explores the reasons for this local peak, in addition to describing the structures {{in the wake of the}} cylinder as a function of tether length. Figure 1 describes the geometry of the problem. A cylinder is attached to a mass-less, inflexible tether whoâs length may be described as the length ratio, L * = L/D; Where L is the length of the tether, and D is the diameter of the cylinder.

40|$|In this {{technical}} report {{we describe the}} method of solution {{to a variety of}} two-dimensional problems involving semi-immersed cylinders in the free surface. These include: (i) determining the reflection and transmission coefficients for the scattering of incident waves by a single fixed cylinder; (ii) determining the added mass and radiation <b>damping</b> for a <b>cylinder</b> forced to move with unit velocity in both heave and sway motions; (iii) determining the heave and sway added mass and damping coefficients for a cylinder in forced motion next to a vertical boundary on which either a Neumann or Dirichlet condition is posed, equivalent to a pair of cylinders forced to move in-phase or out of phase with each other. In each case, the fluid is assumed to be of infinite depth and the fluid motion is two-dimensional. The description of the method of solution for parts (i) and (ii) follows that of Martin & Dixon (1983).

40|$|A {{time domain}} model for {{prediction}} of cross-flow vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of slender structures with circular cross section {{has been under}} development since 2012. As an extension of this work, a time domain model for pure in-line VIV is here proposed, with the same underlying theory. The in-line force model, consisting of added mass, damping and excitation, is based on empirical data from forced oscillation tests of rigid <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Damping</b> and excitation is tuned to give the best fit of the excitation force coefficient calculated from experiments, whereas a strip theory approach is utilized to determine the force is phase with cylinder acceleration, i. e. added mass. The excitation force model represents the time varying drag force induced by vortex shedding, and consists of two frequency-regions with positive excitation. Within these regions the excitation force is able to synchronize with the response vibrations, so that energy is transferred to the cylinder. Numerical simulations are performed to compare the present model with experimental results of free oscillations of rigid and flexible pipes with circular cross section, in uniform current. For the flexible cylinder case, a simple linear finite element structural model is combined with the in-line force model. The numerical simulations and the experiments are seen to match fairly well, both concerning frequency content, amplitude ratio and dominating vibration mode. Some discrepancies are observed, mostly concerning amplitude ratio. However, due {{to the complexity of}} VIV as a phenomenon, and the simplicity of the present model, it is concluded that the results are satisfactory. Consequently, this paper shows that the original idea of synchronization between excitation force and cylinder response is seen to work, not only for cross-flow VIV, but for pure in-line VIV as well...|$|R
30|$|Smart {{materials}} are the materials having multiple tunable properties. These material properties are significantly altered {{in a controlled}} and reversible manner by some external stimuli, e.g., current, electric, or magnetic fields, etc (Ashwani and Mangal 2012). Magneto rheological fluid (MRF) is one of such smart materials. The discovery of the MR fluids is credited to Jacob Rabinow in 1948 at the US National Bureau of Standard (Rabinow 1948). Excellent features of the MRF technology, e.g., fast response, simple interface between electrical power input and mechanical power output, and precise controllability, make it most attractive for many industrial applications. These features have triggered considerable research activities on the modeling and design of MR devices, e.g., dampers, valves, clutches, and brakes, etc. When this technology is employed for an automotive damper, it gives a variable damping coefficient which mainly depends on {{the intensity of the}} magnetic field induced. This makes vibration control/isolation effective over a wide frequency spectrum and is more useful in a real practical sense. A typical magneto-rheological <b>damper</b> consists of <b>cylinder,</b> piston, excitation coil, and the MR fluid which is enveloped in a cylinder. The MR valves and dampers are designed analytically (Zhu et al. 2012; Wei et al. 2003) as well as using finite element method (Li and Guo 2003; Parlak et al. 2012). An analytical optimization design method is also proposed (Rosenfield and Werely 2004) for the MR valves and dampers which are based on the assumption of constant magnetic flux density throughout the magnetic circuit. In the analysis (Rosenfield and Werely 2004), it has been assumed that one region of the magnetic circuit does not saturate prematurely. As the valve performance not only depends on the magnetic circuit but also on the geometry of the ducts through which the MR fluid passes, the above assumption has led to a sub-optimal solution. One, thus, can say that the research on optimal design of an MR damper is still in its nascent age.|$|R
40|$|In the {{structural}} engineering, the damping device {{is the most}} consideration to equip the structure for resisting earthquake. A hydraulic damper {{is a kind of}} energy-dissipating device to reduce {{the structural}} response in earthquake engineering. Newly developed Displacement Dependent Semi-Active Hydraulic Damper (DSHD) is one of hydraulic dampers. The DSHD is a fixture connecting the brace and the structure. For this <b>damper,</b> the hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> is acting as a damper connector. This damper connector, which links a resistance component with a structure, is like a flexible switch with tight-loose and close-open functions. At a seismic loading, the DSHD is functioned to dissipate the energy at the transition of bracing from the tensile constraint to compressive constraint or in reverse. When a structure suffers a large seismic excitation, the overflow function is triggered to prevent the failure of bracing member. That is, at the stress in the linked brace reaching a certain value, it will start the opening of the overflow valve maintaining an aptotic pressure for confining the bracing deformation within the design value. This DSHD provides availability for resisting excessive vibration in the structural design. In this paper, the analysis modeling is set up for simulating the nonlinear behavior of DSHD. The performance of DSHD is investigated in the nonlinear analysis for seismic evaluation. For a DSHD-added structure, to linearize the nonlinear behavior of DSHD is required for structural design. Using damping ratio as a parameter, the DSHD is modeled as a fixture of linear spring and linear viscous damper. This approach is valid for the application in the engineering practice. å¨çµæ§æ¯åæ§å¶çé åï¼æ¼çµæ§ç©ä¸å®è£è½éæ¶æ£å¨çºç®åæåçµæ§èéè½åçç­ç¥ä¹ä¸ãèç±è½éæ¶æ£å¨ææä¾ä¹é²æ»¯å»»åä»¥å¸æ¶å°éåè¼¸å¥çµæ§çè½éï¼ä½¿çµæ§ç©ä¸ç¢çç ´å£ãæ¬ç ç©¶éå°åä¸»åä½ç§»ç¸ä¾é»å°¼å¨(Displacement Semi-active Hydraulic Damper, DSHD) å»ºç«è©²åä»¶ä¹éç·æ§æ¨¡åèç­å¼ç·æ§æ¨¡åï¼ä¸¦æ¢è¨è©²åä»¶æ¼å»ºç¯çµæ§ä¸ä¹è¨­è¨æµç¨ï¼é²èè¨è«å¶èæ©æ¦åé»å°¼å¨ä¹æ¯è¼ã æ¬ææ¢è¨ä¸»é¡å¤§è³å¯åçºç·è«ãåä¸»åä½ç§»ç¸ä¾é»å°¼å¨DSHDä¹åä»¶èæ¶è½è¡çºãDSHDæç¨æ¼çµæ§ä¹æææ§ãDSHDç­å¼ç·æ§åä¹åæãDSHDèæ©æ¦åé»å°¼å¨ä¹æ¯è¼ãçµè«å±å­åç« ç¯ãæ¬ç ç©¶ä¸­æ¢è¨ç®åå¸¸è¦ä¹åä¸»åé»å°¼å¨å¶é»å°¼æ©å¶ä¸¦èåä¸»åä½ç§»ç¸ä¾é»å°¼å¨ä¹ä¸åãç±æ¼DSHDä¸»è¦æ¯ç±æ²¹å£ç¼¸èæ¹åæ§å¶é¥çµæï¼èç±æ²¹è·¯ä¹è®ææ¹è®å¶å°çµæ§ç©ä½ç¨åï¼æ¬æå©ç¨ç­å¼é»å°¼æ¯çæ¦å¿µï¼æ¢è¨DSHDçåæ¸è¨­è¨èå¶é©ç¨æ§ï¼è¨è«ä¸­åæ¬DSHDæéå»¶é²éå°å¶æ¶è½æççå½±é¿ãç¶ç±æ¸å¼åææ¢è¨ï¼å¯ä»¥ç¼ç¾DSHDå¨çµæ§é±æèå°ç¤ä¸»æ§é±æç¸æ¥è¿æå¶æ¶è½æççºæä½³ï¼ä¸¦ç±åæä¸­å¯ç¥DSHDè½å¤ éä½é«æ¨¡æçè²¢ç»éï¼å°ä½ç§»åææè¯å¥½çæ§å¶ææãç±æ¼DSHDçæ¶è½ææåæ±ºå ååä»¶çååº¦èæº¢æµåçè¨­å®ï¼å¨é«ååº¦èé«å¼·åº¦çå ååä»¶ä¸ï¼DSHDææä¾çé»å°¼åæè¯å¥½çèª¿é©æ§ãç±æ¼DSHDææä¾çé»å°¼åé¨æ¯æ¯å¢å èç¢çèª¿é©æ§ï¼ç¶ç±å¶èæ©æ¦åé»å°¼çæ¯è¼å¾ï¼å¯ç¥DSHDçæ¶è½ææåªæ¼æ©æ¦åé»å°¼å¨ï¼ä¸¦å¨çµæ§èå°ç¤å±æ¯çææ³ä¸ï¼å®è£DSHDä¹çµæ§ä½ç§»åæåç¾æ¶æçè¡çºãChapter 1 Introduction	 1 Chapter 2 Energy reduction of DSHD	 6 2. 1 Energy-dissipating behavior of DSHD	 6 2. 2 Fixtures of DSHD	 7 Chapter 3 Validity of the DSHD used in a structure	 10 3. 1 Non-overflow state 	 11 3. 2 Overflow state	 14 3. 3 Validity of DSHD	 17 Chapter 4 A linearization model for DSHD	 29 4. 1 Linearization model for non-overflow state	 31 4. 2 Linearization model for overflow state	 33 4. 3 Equivalent damping ratio	 35 4. 4 Design of overflow force	 37 4. 5 Numerical Simulation 	 38 4. 6 Effect of Time delays	 40 Chapter 5 DSHD versus friction Damper	 56 5. 1 Free Vibration	 59 5. 2 Displacement response factor	 63 5. 3 Comparison of energy reduction	 67 Chapter 6 Concluding remarks	 79 References	 81 Appendix	 8...|$|R
40|$|For {{predictive}} maintenance of circuit breakers, {{a number of}} variables {{must be considered in}} order to assess the genuine working condition of a circuit breaker [CB]. This thesis selects vibration signatures obtained on the operating mechanisms and arcing chambers as a source of monitoring breaker conditions. The task of analyzing the behavior of a circuit breaker is perennial and difficult but the thesis has an attempt to tackle this problem. Experiments have been devised to monitor CBs; however, these have limitations details of which will be discussed. For example, each circuit breaker has its own unique vibration signature and the shape of the vibration may be different even though breakers confront similar problems. CBs have decades-long service life spans and failure rates are relatively low. Those that fail are not necessarily saved and there have been relatively few samples to base evidence upon. There are different vibration analysis algorithms available including Dynamic Time Warping [DTW], Resolution Ratio [RR], Discrete Envelope Statistics [DES], event time extraction, Chi-square based shape methods, and fractal theory. Some of these algorithms are based on acoustic properties of materials and rely on assessing extracted time component and the frequency components are extracted. This research applies multi-resolution analysis [MRA] to decomposed signals to in order to assess different sub-wave levels so that wave features may be captured and modeled. There are many ways to analyze the waves. This thesis uses optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA] as the proposed method. The simuation part of the thesis uses spring performance {{as an example of how}} vibration signature analysis may be implemented. Spring vibrations are evaluated by two classification algorithms: Dynamic Time Warping [DTW] and multi-resolution analysis [MRA] with optimizing fuzzy rules with genetic algorithm [GA]. The first method is competent to identify the faulty cases from the normal ones by looking at the deviation of the vibration signature frequency content. In contrast, it is not capable to identify the degree of how bad it performs from looking at the frequency variation. For the second method, it is capable of not only classifying the abnormal cases from the normal cases, but also distinguishing the vibration signatures into different category so that the spring condition can be retrieved immediately. Fuzzy rules is capable of classify a new case to a category and genetic algorithm is an effective tool to minimize the applicable fuzzy rules. The accuracy of the identification is very satisfactory, which is over 90 %. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is very useful for asset management purpose of breaker since the lifespan of the spring is known. Diagnostic technicians are able to make decision on the replacement scheme of the spring. There are some areas that this research uncovered that suggests further study is mandated. For example, there are other parameters that can be monitored and compared other than spring constant such as valve position in trip coil and close coil, acceleration parameter in changeover valves, <b>damping</b> in hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> and mechanical linkages, gas pressure in primary contacts and breaker resistance in line system...|$|R
