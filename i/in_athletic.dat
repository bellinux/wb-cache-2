5|$|Due to NIAA rules {{which require}} a {{transfer}} student {{to wait a}} year before participating <b>in</b> <b>athletic</b> activities, Randall II was required to sit out his sophomore year in both football and track and field at Bishop Gorman. Then, he backed up four-time state champion starting quarterback Anu Solomon as a junior. That season, he compiled 298 {{yards and two touchdowns}} on 2132 passing with four interceptions and added 42 rushes for 483 yards and seven touchdowns. By his junior year, his 40-yard dash speed was laser-timed at 4.6 seconds. As a senior, he inherited a team that Solomon had led to four consecutive state championships. Despite not starting until his senior season, he entered the year with football scholarship offers from Mississippi State, LSU, Baylor, Syracuse, Arizona State, Utah and UNLV. USA Today predicted that Baylor and LSU may be favorites because of their strong track programs.|$|E

5|$|Columbia University {{athletics}} {{has a long}} history, {{with many}} accomplishments <b>in</b> <b>athletic</b> fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second football game {{in the history of}} the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18-0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1-0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history. The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16-13 victory over archrival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old. A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City. The tradition began in 2002, a year after the Fordham-Columbia game was postponed due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

Connery stated that he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that the Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate <b>in</b> <b>athletic</b> activity which could make them lose muscle mass.|$|E

25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences <b>in</b> <b>athletic</b> performance.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} again {{looked to}} its past to reverse its fortunes {{and brought back}} Johnny Majors, who had recently resigned from Tennessee after a successful 16-year tenure there. However, recruiting had fallen off significantly under Hackett, {{and the quality of}} Pitt's football facilities had fallen behind those of its competition. Over the next four years, Majors tried to recreate the magic of the 1976 season but achieved little success. His final campaign in 1996 resulted in a 4–7 record which included several humiliating defeats. A new chancellor, Mark Nordenberg, brought <b>in</b> <b>athletic</b> director Steve Pederson in 1996 to resurrect the program. The move facilitated Majors' retirement from coaching following the 1996 season, although he continued to serve the university in the position of Special Assistant to the Athletic Director and Chancellor until the summer of 2007.|$|E
