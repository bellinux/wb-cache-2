40|$|This paper defines and classifies <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> {{strategies}} for HVDC grid protection, {{based on the}} method of fault current interruption. HVDC grid protection must act on a much shorter timescale than AC grid protection and faces the challenge to interrupt fast rising fault currents without natural zero crossings. Conversely, the HVDC grid protection equipment, such as HVDC breakers or converters with fault blocking capability, offers several degrees of freedom for <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> {{strategies for}} HVDC grid protection. However, each of these strategies fulfils different objectives and imposes different requirements on HVDC grid components. Therefore, a classification of <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> strategies is needed. In this paper, the objectives and requirements for HVDC grid protection are described. Furthermore, constraints on HVDC grid protection are given. Available methods for fault current interruption and protective relaying algorithms are briefly reviewed. Different classes of <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> strategies are defined and the options for fault current interruption and protective relaying algorithm for each strategy are given. status: publishe...|$|E

Being {{exposed to the}} surrounding environments, {{transmission lines}} are susceptible to atmospheric conditions such as lightning strikes and flora and fauna encroachments. These conditions are called faults. Faults on transmission lines may cause disruption of electricity supply which will affect the overall power system and lead to a wide scale blackout. Therefore, <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> system is deployed to minimize {{the impact of the}} faults to the power system by disconnecting and isolating the affected transmission lines specifically. One of the main devices in fault  clearing system are the protective relays, which serve as the "brain" to provide the decision making element for correct protection and <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> operations. Without protective relays, <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> system is rendered useless. Hence, it is imperative for power utilities, such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), which is an electric utility company in Malaysia, to assess the reliability of the protective relays. In this study, a statistical method called Life Data Analysis using Weibull Distribution is applied to assess the reliability of the protective relays.   Furthermore, the <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> system is modeled using Reliability Block Diagram to simulate the availability of the system and derive reliability indices which will assist TNB in managing the <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve low voltage ride through (LVRT) {{capability}} of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). First, this paper gives expressions of the stator flux and rotor current during the grid fault occurrence and clearing by solving the mathematical model of DFIG. The results of simulation conducted on a 1. 5 MW DFIG in the PSCAD/EMTDC verified the correctness of the derivation. Through qualitative analysis of stator flux expression, different fault durations will lead to the difference of transient during <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> and ignoring the process of <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> will lead to excessive crowbar resistance. Therefore, this paper optimizes the Crowbar resistance by considering both the process of grid fault and <b>fault</b> <b>clearing,</b> and then presents a Crowbar resistance adaptive setting principle based on Crowbar structure with parallel resistor.

One of the key enabling technologies for this transformation is high voltage direct current (HVDC) technology that has range of advantages comparing to today’s AC systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the dynamic {{behavior}} of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) subject to symmetrical voltage sags caused by three-phase faults. A simple control algorithm is considered and assumed ideal: the rotor current irf in the synchronous reference frame is kept constant. This hypothesis allows the electrical transient to be solved analytically, providing a comprehensive description of DFIG behavior under symmetrical sags. The fault-clearing physics of symmetrical sags is also analyzed. That is, the fault is cleared in the successive natural fault-current zeros, leading to a voltage recovery in one, two, or three steps. This clearing process, called discrete <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> in this paper, results in a more accurate sag modeling than the abrupt or instantaneous <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> (the usual modeling in the literature). The fault-clearing process has a strong influence on the rotor voltage required to control the rotor current after <b>fault</b> <b>clearing.</b> To compare the effects of both abrupt and discrete sags, different wind turbine (WT) operating points, which determine different generated powers, are considered. This study helps in the understanding of WT fault ride-through capability. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Point-on-Wave (POW) {{is a new}} {{characteristic}} of voltage sag which has a significant influence on the sensitivity of some equipment. This paper investigates the Point of Inception (POI) and the Point of Recovery (POR) of the voltage sag signal due to symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults in power systems. The POI of voltage sag could be any point on the wave where the voltage sag starts. On the other hand, the POR depends on the circuit breaker <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> practice. Based on the actual <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> angles, three groups of voltage sag signals separated by 180 o are identified and characterized. For single-phase faults there are three possible recovery points on the voltage wave. For double phase faults, six PORs are found at three instants of time. Nine possible PORs for three phase faults are obtained at nine different instants in time. This paper demonstrates that depending on the circuit breaker <b>fault</b> <b>clearing</b> time, the voltage sag duration increases significantly, and this can be harmful to some sensitive equipment. This paper also analyzes the current signals at different POI of corresponding voltage sag signals and detects some critical POI of voltage sags for which the highest transients in current signals occur.

40|$|The {{electric}} market liberalization increases its importance, as economical {{pressure and}} intensified transactions tend to operate electric power systems {{much closer to}} their security limits than ever before. The trend to merge existing systems into much larger entities and to monitor them in shorter and shorter time horizons creates more difficulties. This holds true for analysis aspects and even more for control, in as much as, today; control actions must cope with considerably more stringent market requirements than in the past. The difficulties increase further {{when it comes to}} transient stability phenomena. This thesis has discussed some theory related to transient stability such as the swing equation, transfer reactance, power angle curve and equal area criterion. In this thesis two possible methods of transient stability have been discussed and they are step by step solution for swing curve and equal area criterion. Some MATLAB programs have been developed to study the transient stability cases by using these two methods. For first method, the transient studies are conducted in two cases. For case 1, the <b>fault</b> <b>cleared</b> at time t = 0. 2 second and the second case 2 where the <b>fault</b> <b>cleared</b> at time t = 0. 4 second.
