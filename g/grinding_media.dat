The use of X-ray diffraction line broadening measurements has been proved to be useful in the characterization of microstructure and structural characteristics. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the milling operation variables on the microstructure and structural changes of natural hematite. The influence of the three variables, mill type, <b>grinding</b> time and <b>media</b> surface, through an experimental design was investigated using different methods of characterization by XRD line profile analysis (LPA). The results revealed that mechanical activation of hematite brings about great changes in geometrical and microstructural characteristics with increased the grinding intensity, whatever milling methods are applied. The measurements of the BET surface area, granulometric surface area and particle size show a tendency of the particles to form agglomerates during prolonged milling; in particular with <b>grinding</b> under higher <b>media</b> surface. The agglomeration stage of particles appears to be related to the milling operation conditions. The results indicated that the pores of the agglomerates remain accessible for Nitrogen gas, which addresses the formation of relatively weaker (soft) agglomerates. With a first approximation, the vibratory mill yielded the maximum BET specific surface area, accounting for 18. 4 m 2 /g after 9 hours of milling with higher media surface. The expansions of hematite lattice and volume cell, especially in the initial stages of milling, were identified. The Williamson-Hall method confirms its merit for a rapid overview of the line broadening effects and possible understanding of the main causes. The anisotropic character of line broadening for deformed hematite as a function of grinding variables was revealed. From the Williamson-Hall plots, it was understood that strain and size contributions exist simultaneously in the milled samples. It was found that the hematite crystal is ‘soft' between (024) and other reflections. As seen by the Warren-Averbach method, the planetary mill products yield the smallest crystallites and the maximum root mean square strain (RMSS) (with the exception of the ground sample within one hour and low media surface). The final products contain crystallites sizes between 73. 5 and 5. 6 nm and its lattice strain (RMSS) at L= 10 nm varies from 0. 06 up to 5. 32, depending on the milling performance. With a first approximation, the products of the vibratory mill yielded lower X-ray amorphization degree with regard to the <b>grinding</b> time and <b>media</b> surface variables. The approximation of the energy contribution to the long- lived defects demonstrated that the amorphization character is the most important energy carrier in the activated hematite, accounting for more than 93 % of overall stored energy in hematite. For a given stress energy, the activated hematite in the tumbling mill contains the largest excess energy and has in vibratory mill the smallest amount of excess energy. Generally, the vibratory mill brings about less distortion in the hematite than other mills for the same level of stress energy. However, to produce an identical stress energy in different mills, the planetary mill is needed a specific energy input much higher than the other mills. To investigate the influence of other milling variables in detail, more investigations are recommended, especially as the experiment design and progress in the knowledge nowadays provide possibilities to use advanced methods for the characterization. In our opinion, the investigation of the effect of various defects formed during mechanical activation on the reactivity of the minerals are now only at the beginning of their development. Systematic investigations are recommended to explore what defects are formed under various types of mechanical action in the crystal of the substances of different types and how these defects influence reactivity.

40|$|As ore {{deposits}} become finer grained {{the requirements}} for regrinding before cleaning or leaching have increased substantially. Despite this increasing need, there is no standard test to predict grinding energy requirement below 70 microns. The standard Bond Mill test applies for coarser ball milling, but is not appropriate tor stirred milling with fine <b>media</b> <b>grinding</b> to 70 microns. With no industry - standard test, the energy requirement is often {{made on the basis}} of supplier estimates or benchmarking against similar applications. Yet suppliers use vastly different scale-up methods which result in widely different energy estimates. Estimates can differ by 100 - 300 % even for similar mills. This must result in serious errors to install either too much or too little grinding power. This paper explores this by comparing the actual performance of full scale regrind mills against their original design estimate. It confirms that serious scale-up errors have been made, and have then been perpetuated by "benchmarking". The test conditions to achieve accurate power estimation are discussed. The essential test conditions are: continuous (not batch) tests, ensure steady state (no coarse fraction retained in test mill), correctly account for classification, measure energy directly (not inferred), and using the same media size as the full scale installation. Failure to correctly address even one of these factors can bias results by 40 %; failure to address several multiplies the error...|$|R

Efficient operation can be measured based on cost, metallurgical and energy efficiency of the operation or as {{a combination of the}} three, with energy efficiency becoming increasingly more important in the world and current South African context even more so. With ore bodies becoming more complex and finely disseminated the need for ultra fine grinding to maximise mineral recoveries in PGM concentrating operations by means of mainstream grinding has become more important.

Operating costs for IsaMills™ horizontal mills can be classified into 3 groups i. e. media, maintenance and energy cost.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} treatment of solids {{is one of}} the most common and widely used operations which man has been concerned from the very beginning of the history of civilization. Nowadays, mechanical activation has a wide range of application potentials. Mechanical activation processes are used to modify the properties of materials, to enhance the reactivity of materials and to produce advanced materials and to separate composite materials into its constituents. When materials are subjected to intensive grinding, the structure and microstructure characters of material change widely. These structural changes determine the reactivity of materials and/or minerals and may play an important role in subsequent processes. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the grinding techniques on the microstructure and structural changes of natural hematite. The influences of the five grinding methods with various grinding variables have been investigated: (1) three types of loose media mills in dry mode, (2) interparticle comminution in a confined piston-die press and (3) a stirred media mill in wet mode. A variety of microstructural characterization methods based on X-ray diffraction line profile analysis such as Warren-Averbach, Williamson-Hall and Rietveld methods associated with other characterizations methods have been employed in the present study. In addition, the effects of mechanical activation on the thermal reactivity of hematite concentrate have been studied using hydrogen reduction of activated samples. The results reveal that mechanical activation of hematite causes great changes in geometrical and microstructural characteristics with increased grinding intensity, whatever milling methods were applied. In the case of dry <b>grinding</b> with loose <b>media</b> mills, the results show that the particles show a tendency to form agglomerates during prolonged milling. The expansions of hematite lattice and volume cell were identified. The Williamson-Hall method provides itself to be a technique for a rapid overview of the X-ray line broadening effects and facilitates the understanding of the influence of grinding processes on the material structures. The anisotropic character of line broadening for deformed hematite as a function of grinding variables was revealed. From the Warren- Averbach method, it has been found that the planetary mill products yield the smallest crystallites and the maximum root mean square strain (RMSS) with one exception. The products of the vibratory mill yield approximately lower X-ray amorphization degree with regard to the <b>grinding</b> time and <b>media</b> surface variables. The approximation of the energy contribution to the long- lived defects demonstrated that the amorphization character is the most important energy carrier in the activated hematite, accounting for more than 93 % of overall stored energy in hematite. The comparison of the loose media mills based on stress energy revealed that the vibratory mill brings about less distortion in the hematite than other mills for the same level of stress energy. In addition, the variance analysis revealed that the <b>media</b> surface and <b>grinding</b> time significantly influence the five main response variables at 95 % confidence level. Multivariate techniques are successfully applied for projection of microstructure characters to identify the salient features underlying the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) makes it possible to predict easily which condition leads to production of similar properties or microstructure characters and opens a new window for prediction of microstructure characteristics based on changes in the grinding variables for further investigations. Partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) analysis suggested that mills could be differentiated from each other. From the interparticle comminution investigations, it has been found that the energy absorption is the dominating factor for the size reduction, surface area and induced structural changes in the particle bed comminution. It was also found that the interparticle breakage causes plastic deformation in the material and subsequently induces changes in the structure of the ground hematite and thus provides evidences for the activation potentiality of this method. The comparison with loose media mill (tumbling) in terms of net grinding energy indicated that the interparticle breakage has high energy transfer efficiency to the particles being ground and subsequently favor in the structural changes for a given energy. The comparison of the dry tumbling milling with wet stirred media milling showed that the stirred media mill is more effective in producing structural changes compared to the dry operation; although the X-ray amorphous phase content remained unaffected by the grinding environments, but a large difference was observed in the production of BET surface area. The milling process has been shown to have a pronounced influence on the reduction behavior and kinetic scheme of hematite especially at lower temperature or conversion degrees. Mechanical activation of hematite concentrate lead to the initiation of reduction at lower temperatures. The starting temperature of the reduction was decreased to from 420 about 330 ˚C depending on grinding intensity. Moreover, the pretreatment resulted in improved resolution of overlapping reduction events and the activation energy of the first step of reduction decreased with increasing grinding time. The study showed that the activation energy of the two steps of the reduction depends greatly on the extent of conversion implicating that the reduction processes of hematite to magnetite and magnetite to iron features multi-step characteristics. To investigate the influence of other milling variables in detail, more investigations are recommended, especially as the experiment design and progress in the knowledge to-day provide possibilities to use advanced methods for characterization and analysis. In our opinion, the investigation of the effects of various defects formed during mechanical activation on the reactivity of the minerals are currently only at the beginning of their developments. Systematic investigations are recommended to explore what defects are formed in the crystal of the substances under various types of mechanical action and how these defects influence the reactivity.

40|$|The Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) {{project is}} {{designed}} to accelerate closure of High Level Waste (HLW) tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The SRS tanks store HLW in three forms: sludge, saltcake, and supernate. An in-tank ion exchange process is being designed to treat supernate and dissolved saltcake waste. Through this process, radioactive cesium from the salt solution is adsorbed into Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) ion exchange media packed within a flow-through column. A packed column loaded with radioactive cesium generates significant heat from radiolytic decay. The waste supernate solution within the ion exchange bed will boil around 120 C. Solution superheating above the boiling point within the column could lead to violent hazardous energy releases. System heating from loaded CST is also of concern in other process modules, such as the waste tank. Due to tank structural integrity concerns, the wall temperature limit for the SRS waste tanks is 100 C. The transfer of cesium-loaded CST to the tank could result in localized hot spots on the tank floor and walls which may exceed this limit. As a result, thermal modeling calculations have been conducted to predict the maximum temperatures achievable both in the column and in the waste tank. As specified in the associated Technical Task Plan, one objective of the present work was to compute temperature distributions within the ion exchange column module under accident scenarios including loss of salt solution flow through the bed and loss of coolant system flow. The column modeling domain and {{the scope of the}} calculations in this case were broadened relative to previous two-dimensional calculations to include vertical temperature distributions within the packed bed of ion exchange media as well as the upper column plenum region containing only fluid. The baseline design conditions and in-column modeling domain for the ion-exchange column module are shown in Figure 1. These evaluations assumed the maximum bounding cesium loading considered possible based on current knowledge regarding CST media and the anticipated feed compositions. Since this cesium loading was considerably higher than the nominal loading conditions in SRS waste, cases with lower loading were also evaluated. Modeling parameters were the same as those used previously unless otherwise indicated. The current model does not capture multi-phase cooling mechanisms operative when solution boiling occurs. This feature is conservative {{in the sense that it}} does not account for the large cooling effects associated with phase transfer. However, the potential transfer of heat to the plenum region associated with vertical bubble ascension through the column during boiling is also neglected. Thermal modeling calculations were also performed for the entire waste storage tank for the case where loaded and ground CST was transferred to the tank. The modeling domain used for the in-tank calculations is provided in Figure 2. The in-tank domain is based on SRS Tank 41, which is a Type-IIIA tank. Temperature distributions were evaluated for cylindrical, ground CST mounds located on the tank floor. <b>Media</b> <b>grinding</b> is required prior to vitrification processing of the CST in the SRS Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The location of the heat source region on the tank floor due to the accumulation of CST material was assumed to be just under the grinder. The shape of the CST mound was assumed to be cylindrical. This shape is believed to be most representative of the actual mound shape formed in the tank, given that submersible mixing pumps will be available for media dispersion. Alternative configurations involving other geometrical shapes for the CST mound were evaluated in the previous work. Sensitivity analysis for the in-tank region was performed for different amounts of CST media. As was the case for the in-column model, the in-tank model does not include multi-phase cooling mechanisms operative when solution boiling occurs. The in-column and the in-tank evaluations incorporated recently updated maximum cesium loading levels calculated using the current SCIX feed compositions, which resulted in significantly higher cesium loading than previously calculated. The calculations were conducted to ensure conservative predictions for the maximum temperatures achievable using the current baseline design. The degree of conservatism was reduced for in-column calculations relative to the previous work by using a three-dimensional modeling approach and selecting parameters which were nearer to expected conditions. The degree of conservatism for the in-tank calculations was also reduced by lowering the soil penetration depth below the tank from 150 to 20 feet. The primary goals of the extended thermal modeling effort were to determine whether fluid boiling or superheating are possible within the column module and to determine the maximum floor temperatures within the tank loaded with spent CST...|$|R

They used expensive <b>grinding</b> <b>media</b> that frequently needed to be removed, screened and replaced so that the mills would continue to operate properly. The traditional grinding medium consisted of silica-alumina-zirconium beads that, in those days, cost about US$25 per kilogram ("kg") and lasted for only a few hundred hours. Such a high-cost and short-lived grinding medium would be uneconomic in an industry processing hundreds of tonnes of ore an hour.|$|E
