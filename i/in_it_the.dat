5|$|Baron Franz Nopcsa, in 1902, {{proposed}} a new grouping of dinosaurs, Acanthopholididae, a clade of lightly-built thyreophorans. He included <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> genera Acanthopholis, Polacanthus, Syngonosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and possibly Nodosaurus. Soon after, he also added Priodontognathus and Palaeoscincus. He considered Acanthopholididae {{to be the}} sister clade to Stegosauridae, and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus, which he found had most {{of the characteristics of}} the family. Later, in 1915, he rearranged the species included <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> genera that were later included were Acanthopholis (=Anoplosaurus), Polacanthus, Stegopelta, Stegoceras, and Struthiosaurus. Along with Ankylosaurus, Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae. In 1923 he divided up the family into two subfamilies without comment. These two subfamilies were named Acanthopholinae and Struthiosaurinae.|$|E

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646.

The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E

Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers.

5|$|At around 01:30 on Monday, February 10, 1930, {{approximately}} 40 troops {{belonging to}} the 2ndBattalion of the Fourth Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDD, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The rebels had intended to split into three groups: the first group was to infiltrate the infantry, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support among Vietnamese troops; the second, supported by the VNQDD civilians, was {{to break into the}} post headquarters; and the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The French were caught off guard; five were killed and three seriously wounded. The mutineers isolated a few more French officers from their men, even managing to raise the VNQDD flag above one of the buildings. About two hours later, however, it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, and the remaining 550 Vietnamese soldiers helped quell the rebellion rather than participate <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indigène town post and could not convince the frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a French Indochinese counterattack scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yên Bái.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} number of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field <b>in</b> Bahrain, they are {{under-represented}} in senior management positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Information Technology (<b>IT)</b> field. Specifically, <b>the</b> {{purpose of this study is}} to gain better understanding of the factors that influence Bahraini women in their career advancement to upper managerial levels within <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. <b>The</b> underrepresentation of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field has been widely studied in the context of Western countries, however, there are few studies in Eastern Arabic countries. This study will explore how the culture in Bahrain society, which is Arabic and Islamic, shape the experiences of women working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. <b>The</b> Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT (IDTOGIT) (Trauth, 2002; Trauth et al., 2004; Queensberry & Trauth, 2007) was used in this study as a conceptual and an analytical framework for understanding the factors that influence women’s career advancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. This theory examines the variations between women's personal characteristics and their ways of responding to the environmental influences in understanding women’s participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> profession. An interview methodology was used for investigating the work experience of a group of ten Bahraini women in a senior or middle management position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. <b>The</b> interview methodology helps in getting a more complete picture of what happened in their career advancement, and how they achieved high managerial positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. Face-to-face and semi-structured interviews were conducted with the cases in order to investigate the factors that hinder or facilitate their career advancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. <b>The</b> constructive grounded theory analysis (Charmaz, 2006) was used for analysing the data of the interviews. The key findings of this study are that women <b>in</b> <b>IT</b> careers, especially at the early age of their career, need to show a high level of performance, productivity, and competencies in the work. Women’s career advancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field also demands a high level of commitment and motivation to the organisation, determination, challenge and ambition, and interest <b>in</b> <b>IT</b> work. <b>The</b> data analysis has showed that all of these identified individual characteristics are necessary and have a significant impact on the ability and way of responding to the environmental influences identified in this study. The most important environmental influences identified in this study are management support, relationship with peers, training, organisational structure and rules, understanding <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> role, cultural impact on women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field, and work-life balance. Examining the influence of these individual and environmental factors together and the links between them helped to understand the participation of Bahraini women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> profession. <b>The</b> research findings will help in understanding some of the reasons behind gender segregation and women’s under-representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field <b>in</b> Bahrain. <b>The</b> study findings further offer insights into how to improve women’s career advancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field. Also, it provides a contribution to knowledge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of <b>IT</b> and gender by addressing the factors influencing women’s career advancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IT</b> field.

However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was killed}} in action {{on the evening of}} 7September 1940, after he intercepted a Dornier Do17 bomber taking part in a {{large-scale}} attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between Sundridge and Bessels Green in Kent. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the River Darent. No.234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of friendly fire from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf109. Some observers on the ground, including collier Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose. Four days after his death, No.234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.|$|E
