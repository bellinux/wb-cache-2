In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond <b>grit</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E

40|$|Effects of the <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> of {{the sand}} belt, feeding speed and the feed power of the heads {{of the sand}}er on the surface {{roughness}} of the particleboard panels were investigated. Two surface roughness parameters, average roughness (Ra) and mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), obtained from board surfaces were used in the analysis. Sanding factors were found to have a signifi-cant effect on the surface roughness of the particleboard. Better results were obtained with 40 m/min of feeding speed, 40 - 60 - 80 - 120 of <b>grit</b> <b>sizes,</b> and 67 kW of the feed power of {{the heads of the}} sander...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Grit</b> <b>size</b> {{refers to}} the size of the {{particles}} of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. Several standards have been established for <b>grit</b> <b>size.</b> These standards establish not only the average <b>grit</b> <b>size,</b> but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) [...] "P" [...] grade. The FEPA system is the same as the ISO 6344 standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The [...] "ought" [...] system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as [...] "Coarse", [...] "Medium" [...] and [...] "Fine", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.|$|E
30|$|A higher {{machining}} power {{increases the}} grinding temperature, while the grinding lubrication has an effective cooling effect. A {{slight increase in}} temperature with finer <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> was attributed to {{the cumulative effect of}} a longer total grinding time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} <b>grit</b> {{particle}} <b>size</b> on frictional characteristics was investigated using a vertically oriented brake test rig. Silica sand of <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> 50 - 180 µm, 180 - 355 µm and 355 - 500 µm {{were used in}} drag mode application. Results showed {{that the presence of}} hard particles from environment can influence the friction response significantly. Basically, once the hard particles enter the gap, the value and amplitude of friction coefficient tend to decrease. However, slight increase in friction with smaller particles was recorded due to more hard particles involved in mixing and changing the effective contact area. Better friction stability was related to the presence of smaller grit particles and compacted wear debris to form frictional film on the braking interface...|$|R
30|$|These results {{indicate}} that for all the applied <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> the OSEE intensity amounts to values around 580  a.u. after 1  min of air exposure and around 520  a.u. after 3  min of air exposure, with respective standard deviations between 20  a.u. and 40  a.u. of the OSEE intensity. From these findings we infer that – {{in contrast to the}} time period of air exposure - the roughness of the ground steel surface does not significantly influence the OSEE intensity.|$|R
40|$|Todays diamond {{grinding}} wheels have restrictions for very small <b>grit</b> <b>sizes,</b> {{that are needed}} for achieving the smoothest surface finish, e. g. for fine optics applications (photo lenses, microscope lenses). The aim in lens fabrication {{is to reduce the}} polishing effort, since polishing improves the surface finish but can reduce the form accuracy. The reason for the limited surface finish is the bonding technique used for todays diamond {{grinding wheels}}. Very small diamond <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> of D 3 to D 15 are difficult to bond onto the tool body in terms of grit protrusion, layer thickness uniformity and from accuracy. Furthermore, the cutting edges would improve the abrasive process. CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamond layers are an alternative to bonded diamond wheels. The microcrystalline diamond layer is formed out of many small crystalline tips, having atomistically sharp edges. The crystalline width and height can be set to very small dimensions, easily to 5 micron and smaller. Very precise thickness uniformities can be achieved. Grinding wheels of 80 mm diameter have been coated with CVD diamond grinding layers with crystallite widths of 8 microns. Tests have been performed on an topic grinding machine for the grinding of glass lenses. A surface roughness Ra of 0. 17 micron was achieved...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{there are}} three broad grades of Japanese {{sharpening}} stones: the ara-to, or [...] "rough stone", the naka-to or [...] "middle/medium stone" [...] and the shiage-to or [...] "finishing stone". There is a fourth type of stone, the nagura, which is not used directly. Rather, {{it is used to}} form a cutting slurry on the shiage-to, which is often too hard to create the necessary slurry. Converting these names to absolute <b>grit</b> <b>size</b> is difficult as the classes are broad and natural stones have no inherent [...] "grit number". As an indication, ara-to is probably (using a non-Japanese system of grading <b>grit</b> <b>size)</b> 500-1000 grit. The naka-to is probably 3000-5000 grit and the shiage-to is likely 7000-10000 grit. Current synthetic grit values range from extremely coarse, such as 120 grit, through extremely fine, such as 30,000 grit (less than half a micrometer abrasive particle size).|$|E
50|$|The {{whetstones}} {{became a}} success, primarily because DMT {{made sure that}} each sharpening surface carried the most diamonds per square inch in the industry. The company also used a proprietary process that ensured consistency in diamond <b>grit</b> <b>size.</b> And finally, DMT sharpeners had a mold design that ensured a flat and stable sharpening surface that even exceeded the flatness of ground steel plates.|$|E
50|$|Finer {{synthetic}} diamond grits {{will reduce}} the chipping of tile and burring of steel and provide a smoother finish. Larger diamond grits will provide a higher cutting speed, but {{will be more likely}} to cause chipping, burring, or cracking. Fire departments require blades to be made with a very large diamond grit, to tear through material quickly. An intermediate <b>grit</b> <b>size</b> is used by the production industry.|$|E
40|$|Using the Murphy (1959) {{system for}} scoring {{the degree of}} dentin exposure, Fourche Maline (Woodland) molars show a greater {{attrition}} rate than Caddo (Mississippian) molars. Archeological evidence suggests that this differential in attrition rates {{is caused by the}} use of stone grinders for food preparation in the Fourche Maline culture and their absence among the Caddo. Analysis of scratches on the occlusal surface of molars from these samples confirms this hypothesis. Several techniques for observing these scratches and reconstructing the <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> and <b>grit</b> particle frequencies responsible for this differential abrasion are evaluated...|$|R

50|$|Stones {{are usually}} {{available}} in various grades, {{which refers to}} the <b>grit</b> <b>size</b> of the particles in the stone. Generally, the finer the grit, the denser the material, {{which leads to a}} finer finish of the surface of the tool. Finer grits cut more slowly because they remove less material. Grits are often given as a number, which indicates the density of the particles with a higher number denoting higher density and therefore smaller particles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grit</b> (<b>size),</b> {{hardness}} {{and concentration}} of the diamonds in the diamond segments should also be considered. For example, when the material to be cut is soft, the diamonds' size can be big, hardness can be medium, and concentration should {{be a little bit}} higher. This combination can get good cutting efficiency, {{and at the same time}} prolong the blade's life. When the material is hard, the diamonds' size should be small, hardness should be high, and concentration can be a little bit lower.|$|E
50|$|Processing of raw zisha yixing clay {{involves}} {{removing the}} clay from the underlying strata, drying {{it under the}} sun in open stalls, and then pulverizing the dried clay pieces into fine particles. The clay powder then undergoes air screening to isolate clay particles of the finest <b>grit</b> <b>size.</b> The screened clay is then mixed with water in a cement mixer to a thick paste, piled into heaps, and vacuum processed to remove air bubbles, in addition to some moisture from the clay mixture. The {{quality and quantity of}} water in yixing clay is critical in that it determines the quality of the stoneware products produced. After this processing, the resulting clay is then ready to be used.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{synthetic}} stones are generally of equal quality to natural stones, {{and are often}} considered superior in sharpening performance due to consistency of particle size and control over {{the properties of the}} stones. For example, the proportional content of abrasive particles as opposed to base or [...] "binder" [...] materials can be controlled to make the stone cut faster or slower, as desired. Natural stones are often prized for their natural beauty as stones and their rarity, adding value as collectors' items. Furthermore, each natural stone is different, and there are rare natural stones that contain abrasive particles in <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> finer than are currently available in artificial stones.|$|R

5000|$|The bond is a {{term used}} for the {{softness}} or hardness of the powder metal being used to form the segments. The powdered metals hold the diamonds in place. The bond controls {{the rate at which}} the diamond segments wear down allowing new diamonds to become exposed at the surface to continue grinding with a [...] "sharp" [...] edge. An important step in choosing a blade is to match the bond to the specific material to be cut. Additional factors to consider are the type and power of the equipment to be used and the availability of water. Harder materials need a softer bonded segment to allow for continuous diamond exposure. Softer materials like asphalt or freshly poured concrete can use a harder segment to resist the increased wear that softer, abrasive materials create. In addition, the diamonds' <b>grit</b> (<b>size),</b> toughness, and concentration should also match the nature of the material to be sawed. For example, when hard materials are cut, the diamonds should be smaller.|$|E
50|$|Grinding is {{generally}} done with {{some type of}} sharpening stone. Sharpening stones come in coarse and fine grits and {{can be described as}} hard or soft based on whether the grit comes free of the stone with use. Many sources of naturally occurring stones exist around the world; some types known to the ancient world are no longer used, due to exhaustion of former resources or the ready availability of superior alternatives. Arkansas, USA is one source for honing stones, which are traditionally used with water or honing oil. India is another traditional source for stones. Ceramic hones are also common, especially for fine <b>grit</b> <b>size.</b> Japanese water stones (both artificial and natural) come in very fine grits. Before use, they are soaked in water, then flushed with water occasionally to expose new stone material to the knife blade. The mixture of water and abraded stone and knife material is known as slurry, which can assist with the polishing of the knife edge and help sharpen the blade. Generally, these are more costly than oilstones. Coated hones, which have an abrasive, sometimes diamonds, on a base of plastic or metal, are also available.|$|E
40|$|Unidirectional surface {{roughness}} of varying magnitudes were created on both nickel and mild steel by grinding on SiC papers with <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> from G 60 (roughest) to G 1200 (smoothest) and the corrosion resistance in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution was determined using a potentiodynamic polarization technique. A different trend of corrosion rate versus roughness was seen for the active-passive metal (nickel) and non-active-passive metal (mild steel). For nickel {{there was an}} increase in corrosion rate with increasing roughness, whereas for mild steel the corrosion rate decreased with increasing {{surface roughness}}. Furthermore, through a detailed examination of the surface before and after corrosion using techniques including profilometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), it was established that different corrosion mechanisms were operative for nickel and mild steel. For both metals, the smaller <b>grit</b> <b>sizes</b> produced a rougher surface with wider and deeper grooves. In the case of nickel, the higher roughness provided a greater contact area between the corrosive medium and metal and there was trapping of the corrosive ions in the deep grooves. Both of these factors would lead to an increase in corrosion rate. Also, for the smoother nickel surfaces, it is easier to form a stable passive film. For mild steel, which does not form a passive film, corrosion rates are generally much higher than for nickel. For the rougher surfaces with the deeper grooves, the corrosion product, FeSO 4, can fill the grooves thereby acting as a barrier to further ingress of the corrosive ions to the un-corroded metal...|$|R
