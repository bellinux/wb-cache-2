When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s, Laucke {{moved to}} New York City to further his career. He {{was asked by}} Valdès-Blain if he would mind sharing his one-room {{apartment}} with flamenco guitarist Paco deLucía.

Although Laucke had played flamenco for his own pleasure {{since he was a}} child, he had never felt comfortable playing it in public.
