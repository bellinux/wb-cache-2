25|$|Examples of {{resonating}} type bass traps {{include a}} rigid container {{with one or}} more portholes or slots (i.e. <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator),</b> or a rigid container with a flexible diaphragm (i.e. membrane absorber). Resonating type bass trap achieves absorption of sound by sympathetic vibration of some free element of the device with the air volume of the room.|$|E
25|$|Resonating {{absorbers}} vary in construction, {{with one}} type of membrane absorber using a springy sheet of wood that attaches to the enclosure only along the edges/corners, and another using a more floppy sheet of thin material stretched like a drumhead. A <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator</b> can have one port tuned to a single frequency, or several ports tuned to either a single or to multiple frequencies, with round port, slotted port, or even perforated construction. Resonating absorbers often incorporate porous absorption internally to simultaneously lower the resonant frequency and broaden the spectrum of absorption.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many flutes, ocarinas do {{not rely}} on pipe length to produce a {{particular}} tone. Instead the tone {{is dependent on the}} ratio of the total surface area of opened holes to the total cubic volume enclosed by the instrument. This means that, unlike a flute or recorder, sound is created by resonance of the entire cavity and the placement of the holes on an ocarina is largely irrelevant – their size is the most important factor. Instruments that have toneholes close to the voicing/embouchure should be avoided, however; as an ocarina is a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator,</b> this weakens tonal production.|$|E

Sound absorption characteristics of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> {{can be enhanced}} and controlled with a use of thermal stratification in porous insets inside resonators. A simplified lumped-element model for thermoacoustically augmented <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> is developed in this article.

40|$|Echo {{and sound}} {{resonance}} {{in a conference}} room cause obscure speech and make listeners tired. Thus, the acoustical properties of a conference room are vitally important. The conference room 412 at Sharif University Physics Department failed to meet basic acoustical standards. The aim of this research is to improve reverberation time (RT) of the conference room using <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> are widely used to absorb sound noise especially at low frequencies. They are particularly useful when noise has a narrow-frequency band. One of the advantages of using <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> is their capacity to be tuned on different frequencies. We enhanced acoustical properties of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> using proper absorbers and diffusers. In order to decrease the RT, a large number of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> have been made and installed in proper positions in the conference room. The RT was measured before and after installation. The measurements indicate that the acoustical characteristics of the conference room have been significantly improved...|$|R

25|$|Blowing {{over the}} edge of a jug or bottle can create a nearly pure tone of low frequency. The driving force is the flow over the jug edge so one might expect an edge tone dipole sound field. In this case, The {{curvature}} and roundness of the edge makes a strong edge tone unlikely. Any periodicity at the edge is likely submerged in the Class III feedback from the jug volume. The unsteady edge flow sets up a classical <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator</b> response in which the interior geometry and the jug neck determines the resultant frequency. A resonance equation is shown below.|$|E
25|$|At higher Reynolds numbers, {{the flow}} became chaotic {{resulting}} in broad-band sound. The hole tone has been rediscovered {{in the form}} of the tea pot whistle. They found that above a Reynolds number of 2000, hole tone operation occurred with symmetric vortex evolution and a constant Strouhal number with Reynolds number. Comparison of their data with data in the figure suggests that the cylindrical enclosure between the two orifices raises the Strouhal number. There was no mention of frequency jumps. They noted that at lower speeds, the cylindrical volume responded as a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator.</b> Baron Rayleigh was aware of this whistle; it was called the bird call then.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resonator}} in the ocarina {{can create}} overtones, {{but because of}} the common [...] "egg" [...] shape, these overtones are many octaves above the keynote scale. In similar <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator</b> instruments with a narrow cone shape, like the Gemshorn or Tonette, some partial overtones are available.

2500|$|It {{was known}} that the ancient Greeks had {{developed}} the technique of using vases built into their auditoria which added resonance to strengthen tone or improve its quality, though the effect was very weak. The Building Research Station developed an electronic method of lengthening the reverberation time by a system called ‘assisted resonance’ in which some of the acoustical energy lost to the surfaces of the hall was replaced by acoustical energy supplied by a loudspeaker. Each microphone and its associated loudspeaker {{was limited to the}} one frequency by placing the microphone inside a <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonator</b> fitted into the ceiling in a range of sizes which resonated over a wide range of the low frequencies which critics and musicians thought did not adequately reverberate in the hall. 172 channels were used to cover a frequency range of 58Hz to 700Hz, increasing reverberation time from 1.4 to 2.5 s in the 125Hz octave band. [...] However, the system never fully solved the problem, and as it aged it became unreliable, occasionally emitting odd sounds during performances. It was switched off in 1998, which returned the acoustics to their poor state, so bad that they make performers who play in it [...] "lose the will to live", according to Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has proposed that {{an array of}} <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> may be an effective method for suppressing the propagation of pressure and sound waves, generated by a high-speed train entering and moving in a tunnel. The array {{can be used to}} counteract environmental noise from tunnel portals and also the emergence of a shock wave in the tunnel. The implementation of an array of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> in current and future high-speed train-tunnel systems is studied. Wave propagation in the tunnel is modelled using a quasi-one-dimensional formulation, accounting for non-linear effects, wall friction and the diffusivity of sound. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is then used to optimise the design of the array, subject to the geometric constraints of a demonstrative tunnel system and the incident wavefront in order to attenuate the propagation of pressure waves. It is shown that an array of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> can be an effective countermeasure for various tunnel lengths. In addition, the array can be designed to function effectively over a wide operating envelope, ensuring it will still function effectively as train speeds increase into the future...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{can be divided into}} two main subjects. First, lightweight designs for acoustic devices such as <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> and loudspeakers used for noise control in rocket payload compartments are developed. Second, active control using a hybrid control system (with structural and acoustic actuators) was tested experimentally. Due to the weight limitations for this application, <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> and loudspeakers are re-designed {{in order to reduce the}} device weight as much as possible while maintaining performance. For <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators,</b> this is done by modeling the resonator for different structural shapes, wall materials and wall thicknesses using a finite element analysis software. The final design is then compared to the rigid resonators and is shown to perform effectively. These designs are then successfully applied to the full-scale fairing at Boeing facilities. In order to design a lightweight loudspeaker, a comparative approach was used. A standard 12 ” loudspeaker is taken as the reference loudspeaker and weight reduction solutions are applied to it while maintaining performance. The loudspeaker is characterized using mechanical, electrical and acoustical theories, and an optimization process is applied in order to minimize a define...|$|R

The experimental setup shown in Fig.  4 b {{consists of a}} transducer for underwater sound source and two hydrophones for detection of the signals. Extremely low transmission was observed as visualized in Fig.  4 c, indicating that the propagation wave was transformed to evanescent form due to the negative bulk modulus of the metamaterials. Moreover, a formation of negative phase velocity was also confirmed in this experiment due {{to the loss of}} friction in the system. Other related works for different types of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> can be found in [32 – 35].|$|R
40|$|<b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> {{are closed}} volumes that are {{connected}} to pipes.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the acoustic absorption of granular porous media made of non-cohesive piles of spherical shells. These shells are either rigid or elastic, possibly drilled with a neck (<b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators),</b> and either porous or impervious. A description is given of acoustic propagation through these media using the effective medium models proposed by Johnson (rigid particles) and Boutin (rigid <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators),</b> which we extend to the configurations studied in this work. A solution is given for the local equation of elasticity of a shell coupled to the viscous flow of air through the neck and the micropores. The models and our simulations are compared to absorption spectra measured in reflection in an impedance tube. The effective medium models and our measurements show excellent agreement for configurations made of rigid particles and rigid <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> that induce an additional peak of absorption at low frequency. A shift of the Helmholtz resonance toward low frequencies, due to the softness of the shells is revealed by our experiments for elastic shells made of soft elastomer and is well reproduced by our simulations.

40|$|<b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> {{are often}} {{applied for the}} sound {{equalisation}} of control rooms in recording studios, through adequate levelling of the low frequency acoustic modal room responses. The number of controlled acoustic modes depends on the central frequency and damping of resonators, {{as well as on}} the modal density of the controlled system within the resonators frequency range. In a recent paper we proposed to improve the efficiency of such devices by, instead of using basic <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>resonators</b> develop shape optimized multi-modal resonators in order to cope with a larger number of intrusive room modes. In spite of the promising results thus obtained, further work is needed to demonstrate the feasibility of such approach.

More specifically, using a substructure computational approach we theoretically derive the coupled acoustical modes of control rooms fitted with several optimized multi-mode resonators...|$|R
