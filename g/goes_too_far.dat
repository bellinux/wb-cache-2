25|$|The Kyoto Protocol is {{the most}} {{prominent}} international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue that it <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> or not nearly far enough in restricting emissions of greenhouse gases. Another area of controversy {{is the fact that}} China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita, they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of e and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of e respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita e emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of e. Nevertheless, China is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and India 4th (see: countries by greenhouse emissions). Various predictions see China overtaking the US in total greenhouse emissions between late 2007 and 2010, and according to many other estimates, this already occurred in 2006.|$|E

[...] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that proposed Republican relaxation of Wall Street regulations would [...] "put y'all back in chains" [...] led to a similar analysis of Biden's face-to-face campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track. [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Most candidates give the same stump speech over and over, putting reporters if not the audience to sleep. But during any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion." [...] Time magazine wrote that Biden often <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and that [...] "Along with the familiar Washington mix of neediness and overconfidence, Biden's brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness." ...|$|E

And if she <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|If a fielder {{uses the}} ball to remove the bails from either set of stumps whilst the batsmen are running between the wickets (or {{otherwise}} away from the crease {{during the course of}} play), then the batsman (striker or non-striker) is out. The batsman nearest the set of stumps from which the bails were removed, but not actually in safe territory, is given out. If the batsman has any part of his body or his bat (if he is holding it) on the ground behind the line of the crease, then he cannot be run out (except if both batsmen are {{on the same side of}} a crease) i.e. on the line is considered as out; frequently it is a close call whether or not a batsman gained his ground in this way before the bails were removed. (The difference between stumped and run out is that the wicket-keeper may stump a batsman who <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> forward to play the ball (assuming he isn't attempting a run), whilst any fielder, including the keeper, may run out a batsman who <b>goes</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for any other purpose, including for taking a run.)

[...] A fielder can also [...] "remake" [...] the stumps and remove a stump/bail to effect a run out.|$|E
