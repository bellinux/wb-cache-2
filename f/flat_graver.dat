The method for [...] "walking" [...] the graver may also be referred to as [...] "wriggle" [...] or [...] "wiggle" [...] cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry.

Apart from the two already known megalithic tombs »Pastors Kamp« and »Stippers Höhe« there are two <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> and a house plan of the Funnel(-neck-) beaker culture. The two <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> are covered with cobble stones in the regionally typical way. The house plan can be associated typologically with the houses with wall trenches of the type Flögeln of the Funnelbeaker west group. The pottery dates the house and <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> to the phase Brindley 4.

40|$|In 1957 Dr C. C. W. J. Hijszeler {{excavated}} {{the remains}} of the destroyed megalithic tomb O 2 near Mander. Apart from a few short notes the results have not been published. In 1995 the provincial archaeologist, A. D. Verlinde, re-excavated the site, in order to locate the destroyed tomb precisely prior to the construction of an oblong earthen mound on the site, and to establish the quality of any remaining evidence. Both authors participated in the excavation. The 1995 excavation enabled the complete reconstruction of the ground plan of the megalithic chamber, due to the discovery of the foundation pit of the eastern end stone, and the elucidation of the character of some sub-recent features recorded in 1957. An unexpected discovery was that of a number of TRB <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> and of pits with TRB pottery adjacent to the megalithic tomb. The finds from the destroyed hunebed have been sorted and described, but unfortunately not illustrated either as drawings or as photos {{due to a lack of}} manpower and finance. The finds from the <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> and pits containing pottery excavated in 1995 are illustrated here, however. The decorated pottery from the hunebed belongs largely to Brindley’s Horizons 3 and 4, but two typical Horizon 5 pots are preserved as well. In the spread of sherds in front of the entrance to the tomb Horizon 2 pottery was discovered, suggesting that the hunebed may have been constructed during that Horizon. The pottery from the <b>flat</b> <b>graves</b> next to the hunebed belongs partly to Horizon 4, but largely to Horizon 5, indicating that this <b>flat</b> <b>grave</b> cemetery started during the last phase of use of the hunebed, but stayed in use for some time after the last burial in the hunebed. 59 94 45 / 46...|$|R

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Late Iron Age (c. 500c. 793; in Norway known as the Merovingian Age), there were several changes in Nordic culture: for example the deterioration of the quality of works of art and syncopation of the spoken language. Burial customs in several regions were drastically simplified: stone coffins (stones placed together as a coffin protecting the body within a grave or a tumulus) were no longer used, and tumuli became smaller or were replaced by <b>flat</b> <b>graves.</b> Also grave goods appear to have been lesser in amount than before.|$|R

40|$|The terms Tumulus {{culture and}} Urnfield culture imply a {{development}} from inhumations in barrows to cremations in <b>flat</b> <b>grave</b> cemeteries which marks the transition between the Middle and Late Bronze Ages in southern Central Europe. It was {{the goal of}} a comprehensive study to investigate this epoch-making cultural change in detail. Important parameters of the investigation are the geographical and chronological distributions of tumulus and <b>flat</b> <b>graves,</b> the dimensions of tumuli, the positions of graves in the barrows and the patterns of primary and secondary burials, the combinations and arrangements of grave goods, as well as the various cremation practices and especially the spread of the urn grave custom. For the analysis by mapping and statistics, more than 3000 burials of the late Tumulus culture (Bronze C, 14 th c. B. C.) and the early Urnfield culture (Bronze D, Hallstatt A, 13 th- 11 th c. B. C.) from southern Germany and adjacent areas were encoded to a data base. As a general result it can be shown that the abandonment of tumulus graves in favour of the <b>flat</b> <b>grave</b> custom, the intrusion of incineration and urn rite, and, furthermore, the furnishing of graves with pottery and metal objects represent independent factors of burial practices. Depending on the geographical and chronological contexts the various features are interconnected in manifold ways. The development of burial rites at the transition from the Tumulus to the Urnfield period thus turns out a complex and multicausal process which took place gradually and asynchronously in neighbouring regions. It is suggested that the displacement of the tumulus by the <b>flat</b> <b>grave</b> custom was an inevitable concomitant of the introduction of the cremation practice and triggered by functional reasons. The implementation of the cremation custom and of the urn grave rite should be regarded as chronologically separate processes with different ideological backgrounds. Falkenstein Frank.
