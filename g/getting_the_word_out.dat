2500|$|In December 1928, Bert Logan, an {{employee}} of the Hudson's Bay Company was posted to Little Red River, Alberta, on arrival he was unpacking when he suddenly became very ill. His wife, a nurse, realized he had diphtheria, and a desperate effort started to get inoculations to the town before anyone else was seriously infected.

At the time, there were no roads in the north, and the nearest telegraph station was miles away over a frozen landscape. The message eventually reached Edmonton, and on January 1, May was asked if he could deliver the medicine. He left in an Avro Avian with another flying club member, Vic Horner, the next day around noon, and landed on Kimiwan Lake, McLennan for the night just before 4 p.m. when it was becoming dark. They refueled on the Peace River and continued their flight, arriving in Fort Vermilion at 3 p.m. A group had just arrived from Little Red River and the drugs were quickly distributed. They had to stop in Peace River on the return flight due to engine damage from the low quality fuel, and did not arrive back in Edmonton until January 7. By this point, his flight had become known across Canada as [...] "the race against death", and he and Horner arrived to find a media circus and a mob of thousands of Edmontonians waiting for them at the airport.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2010, after {{a process}} of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> beyond the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) and to non-English {{speaking}} areas, a flag was chosen following a vote on a non-AVEN site. It has since been seen used on Tumblr in various LGBT areas, but had been seen alongside other Sexual Orientations flags previous to formal election. The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe representing the grey-area between sexual and asexual, the white stripe sexuality, and the purple stripe community. The AVEN logo is a triangle fading from white to black to symbolise the gradient between sexuals, gray-asexuals, demisexuals, and asexuals. The ace of spades and ace of hearts are also used as asexual symbols since [...] "ace" [...] is a phonetic shortening of asexual. Generally, romantic asexuals use the ace of hearts as their symbol and aromantic asexuals use the ace of spades.|$|E

It is believed that access to information is the doorway to more effective government for everybody and community empowerment.

30|$|In this paper, we {{distinguish}} between the terms dissemination and propagation because although they have different meanings, education developers often use them interchangeably. Dissemination is about spreading ideas: <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to potential adopters about trying an innovation, e.g., publishing a paper or posting resources on a website. Propagation, on the other hand, has occurred only when a new teaching strategy is used successfully by non-developing instructors.
