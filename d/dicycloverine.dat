50|$|Dihexyverine is an antimuscarinic {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{related to}} <b>dicycloverine</b> {{used as a}} spasmolytic.|$|E
50|$|Some antimuscarinic drugs, {{including}} <b>dicycloverine,</b> hyoscyamine, and scopolamine, {{are known}} to cause sexual arousal and aphrodisiac side effects, {{especially in the case}} of an overdose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicycloverine,</b> {{also known}} as dicyclomine, is a {{prescription}} medication that relieves muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract through an apparent mechanism of nonselective smooth muscle relaxation, and that presents a range of anticholinergic side effects. It was first synthesized in the United States circa 1947.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicycloverine</b> {{can cause}} a range of {{anticholinergic}} side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, [...] and, at higher doses, deliriant effects. Recreational use of this drug for its anticholinergic effects (both low dose for euphoria and high dose for delirium) has been rarely reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicycloverine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} chemically in the United States circa 1945 (with patent from Wm S Merrell Company filed in January 1946, {{presentation at the}} September 1946 meeting of the Medicinal Chemistry Section of the A.C.S., and publication of the preparation in that Society's journal in November 1947).|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>dicycloverine</b> {{is known}} to [...] "impair mental {{alertness}} or physical coordination", those taking the drug should [...] "avoid driving or operating machinery until effect on the individual are known". It is also important that women inform their clinicians [...] "if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed".|$|E
50|$|<b>Dicycloverine</b> - an antispasmodic, which {{relieves}} painful stomach cramps and spasms. It relaxes {{the muscle}} {{in the walls}} of the stomach and intestines by blocking muscarinic receptors that are found in the muscle. By blocking these receptors it prevents the chemical acetylcholine from activating them and causing contraction. This reduces muscle contractions and allows the stomach and intestines to relax, reducing painful cramps and spasms.|$|E
5000|$|Dicyclomine is used {{to treat}} {{intestinal}} hypermotility, and the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (also known as spastic colon). It relieves muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract; while the mechanism or mechanisms of <b>dicycloverine</b> action were, as of 2004, unestablished, the drug [...] "appears to act as nonselective smooth muscle relaxant." [...] The drug presents adverse events that are [...] "manifestations of pharmacologic effects at muscarinic-cholinergic receptors," [...] events which are [...] "usually... reversible when therapy is discontinued." ...|$|E
50|$|Side effects include {{dry mouth}} and throat, eye pain, blurred vision, restlessness, dizziness, arrhythmia, flushing, and faintness. An {{overdose}} will cause headache, nausea, vomiting, and {{central nervous system}} symptoms including disorientation, hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, short-term memory loss, and possible coma in extreme cases. The euphoric and sexual effects are stronger than those of atropine but weaker than those of scopolamine, as well as <b>dicycloverine,</b> orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and ethanolamine antihistamines like phenyltoloxamine. It can also act as a diuretic.|$|E
50|$|Diarrhoea {{accompanied}} by significant cramping or intestinal cramping alone {{may benefit from}} either adding another smooth-muscle agent to the protocol such as <b>dicycloverine,</b> papaverine, or orphenadrine (which accomplishes several things at once since it is an antihistamine as noted above). Such cases may also benefit from a switch to paregoric, laudanum, powdered or granulated opium, or belladonna-and-opium suppositories, as {{all of the above}} include many drugs thatwork together and have non-narcotic alkaloids like papaverine and other components like oils, waxes, resins etc. which work elsewhere in the body. Pantopon (opium alkaloids hydrochlorides) and similar preparations have much of the advantages of whole opium in injectable form.|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} off-target {{anticholinergic}} effects of medications and acute cognitive impairment in older adults requires urgent investigation. We aimed {{to determine whether}} a relevant in vitro model may aid the identification of anticholinergic responses to drugs and the prediction of anticholinergic risk during polypharmacy. In this preliminary study we employed a co-culture of human-derived neurons and astrocytes (NT 2. N/A) derived from the NT 2 cell line. NT 2. N/A cells possess much of the functionality of mature neurons and astrocytes, key cholinergic phenotypic markers and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). The cholinergic response of NT 2 astrocytes to the mAChR agonist oxotremorine was examined using the fluorescent dye fluo- 4 to quantitate increases in intracellular calcium [Ca 2 +]i. Inhibition of this response by drugs classified as severe (<b>dicycloverine,</b> amitriptyline), moderate (cyclobenzaprine) and possible (cimetidine) on the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, was examined after exposure to individual and pairs of compounds. Individually, <b>dicycloverine</b> had the most significant effect regarding inhibition of the astrocytic cholinergic response to oxotremorine, followed by amitriptyline then cyclobenzaprine and cimetidine, in agreement with the ACB scale. In combination, <b>dicycloverine</b> with cyclobenzaprine had the most significant effect, followed by <b>dicycloverine</b> with amitriptyline. The order of potency of the drugs in combination frequently disagreed with predicted ACB scores derived from summation of the individual drug scores, suggesting current scales may underestimate the effect of polypharmacy. Overall, this NT 2. N/A model may be appropriate for further investigation of adverse anticholinergic effects of multiple medications, in order to inform clinical choices of suitable drug use in the elderly...|$|E
