I ought to have realised instantly it wasn't that. I did, at any rate, whatever other impressions there were, release the winding of the outer net and let the balloon expand again, and that no doubt did something to break my fall. I don't remember doing that. Indeed, all I do remember is the giddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it down a flat spiral, the hurried rush of fields and trees and cottages on my left shoulder and the overhung feeling as if the whole apparatus was pressing down the top of my head. I didn't stop or attempt to stop the screw. That was going on, swish, swish, swish all the time.|$|E

However, {{it must have been}} about right, for the Times article was in the spirit I wished to arouse. I hope we can get rid of the man before it is too late. He has set the natives to war; but the natives, by God's blessing, do not want to fight, and I think it will fizzle out--no thanks to the man who tried to start it.

5000|$|In a March 1993 {{visit to}} the church her aunt and uncle {{attended}} in Shreveport, Louisiana, Scott, then 11, chose to commit herself to Christianity. Thereafter, she was known among {{her family and friends}} as very devout, pious girl, and conveyed her love of the Lord and His Son to the people she knew. By April 1998, five of her closest friends had distanced themselves from her because of her increasing commitment to her faith. Furthermore, because of her faith, she was occasionally subjected to mockery by several of her peers, including Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Rachel documented this in a letter to a relative one year to the day before her death. This letter includes the words: [...] "Now that I have begun to walk my talk, they make fun of me. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done. I don't even have to say anything, and they turn me away. I have no more personal friends at school.

In 1991 {{he attended}} his first rave {{while on a}} trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, and afterwards began attending every rave he could around Denver, Colorado. According to Blakley, he had first developed an interest in the rave scene after friends in New York told him about DJ Frankie Bones's Storm raves in Brooklyn. He quickly developed an interest in deejaying himself, buying his first turntables and learning to mix hardcore techno. He also bought a crate of records at a record store in Los Angeles, recollecting that [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the hell <b>I</b> was buying.

5000|$|After College Miller {{was unable}} to find work in journalism. Instead he moved through several occupations {{including}} a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and Ice Cream scooper at the Village Dairy. Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with Tom Snyder, Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a [...] "bad hotel" [...] which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller [...] "I'm in Hell, I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case." [...] Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as [...] "an all-gay florist". Leaving that job he worked as an Ice Cream scoop. Miller recalled that was twenty-one - five years out of high school and was wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licences. A spur to quit the Ice Cream scoop job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and {{he was the one who}} had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment. Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs his life would become a Franz Kafka novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.|$|E

Thus all passion, however vile, is called {{by the name of}} 'love,' all superstitious terror and grovelling attempts to conciliate the unseen are known as 'religion,' while selfish greed and the hungry lust for power masquerade as laudable 'ambition.' Men and women, especially women, hate the truth, because, like the electric light, it shows them as they are, and that is vile.

We were beaten, trampled underfoot, kept without food, without water, being unable to wash ourselves, being unable to cut our beard and hair, agglutinated {{the ones on the}} others, under inhuman conditions. The most important thing to raise here is that all of us were put in chains of iron using a steel stick which bound our feet to our belt. This literally paralyzed us. It was if we had a stake, stuck in our body. We ate with it, we relieved our natural needs with it and that lasted for several weeks. They removed these iron bars on the last day before the transfer to Kandahar.|$|R
60|$|I return Mr. Chorley's[106] note, my dear cousin, with thankful {{thoughts}} of him--as of you. I wish I could persuade {{you of the}} rightness of my view about 'Essays on Mind' and such things, and how the difference between them and my present poems is not merely the difference between two schools, as you seemed to intimate yesterday, nor even the difference between immaturity and maturity; {{but that it is}} the difference between the dead and the living, between a copy and an individuality, between what is myself and what is not myself. To you who have a personal interest and--may I say? affection for me, the girl's exercise assumes a factitious value, but to the public the matter is otherwise and ought to be otherwise. And for the 'psychological' side of the question, do observe that I have not reputation enough to suggest a curiosity about my legends. Instead of your 'legendary lore,' it would be just a legendary bore. Now you understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. I do not underrate Pope nor his school, but I do disesteem everything which, bearing the shape of a book, is not the true expression of a mind, and I know and feel (and so do you) that a girl's exercise written when all the experience lay in books, and the mind was suited rather for intelligence than production, lying like an infant's face with an undeveloped expression, must be valueless in itself, and if offered to the public directly or indirectly as a work of mine, highly injurious to me. Why, of the 'Prometheus' volume, <b>even,</b> you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think and desire. 'The Seraphim,' with all its feebleness and shortcomings and obscurities, yet is the first utterance of my own individuality, and therefore the only volume except the last which is not a disadvantage to me to have thought of, and happily for me, the early books, never having been advertised, nor reviewed, except by accident, once or twice, are as safe from the public as manuscript.|$|R

5000|$|The two demos {{eventually}} {{found their way}} to the hands of Paulo André, the producer of the Abril Pro Rock festival, in Recife. The band was then invited to perform on one of the biggest alternative music festivals in Brazil, the Superdemo. Their first album self-titled album, released in 1999, became a huge seller {{on the back of the}} hit single [...] "Anna Júlia". The album's success was driven by the song [...] "Anna Julia" [...] chosen - for the record - as the first single, for it was a number that resonated among young people, identified with the Jovem Guarda style lyrics, mixed to a musical group influenced by rock, ska and samba. The album was produced by famed producer Rick Bonadio, known for his work with bands that were selling-phenomena. According to Bonadio, he had been responsible for convincing the band to put the song in the final selection of the repertoire CD. The single was inspired by a band producer's affair, and brought the band not only to radio stations across the country, but also to various events, such as agricultural fairs and soccer games stadiums and micaretas, and [...] to play for more than 80,000 people in some of the country festivals, even with only one record released. The band was a regular on popular television shows. In just one semester, [...] "Anna Julia" [...] was already included in the top positions of the leading radio stations in the country. Its music video, which featured the actress Mariana Ximenes, was constantly displayed on programs dedicated to both gender in channels such as MTV. In just one year, [...] "Los Hermanos" [...] sold 300,000 copies emplacado and two singles in the hit parade, as the aforementioned [...] "Anna Julia" [...] and the second single, [...] "Primavera". The album also spawned a Grammy nomination in 2000. In the Multishow award, in 2000, the band won the [...] "Best Song" [...] award with [...] "Anna Julia", beating competitors such as Chico Buarque. Camelo said, [...] "Man, <b>I</b> do not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to say, <b>I</b> feel embarrassed to win a prize in a category where Chico Buarque is competing.".The success of [...] "Anna Júlia", in a general sense, overshadowed the rest of their career, leading some to think they are a one-hit wonder, despite experiencing success among fans and music enthusiasts with other works. The song has been covered by many different artists, including Jim Capaldi with the guitar solo being played by George Harrison, in his last recorded work.|$|R
