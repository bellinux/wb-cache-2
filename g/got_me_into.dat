Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad <b>got</b> <b>me</b> <b>into</b> soccer. Basketball is more of my love. I was sitting down and watching Michael Jordan and Kobe and all of those guys when I was younger, and I had more of a passion for it."

500|$|Selling England by the Pound {{has been}} praised by other songwriters and musicians. Rush drummer Neil Peart has said: [...] "I think Selling England by the Pound is an {{enduring}} masterpiece of drumming. Beautiful drumming, lovely sound, and the arrangements, I {{think they really}} nailed {{the best of what}} that band as an entity could have done with that album." [...] Fish, solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion, has called it [...] "the definitive Genesis album", praised its [...] "emotive" [...] quality, said the wordplay was [...] "one of the things that became quite an influence on me - the games within the lyrics" [...] and concluded it [...] "took a whole jump forward and was the album that really <b>got</b> <b>me</b> <b>into</b> Genesis". Singer and songwriter Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices considers Selling England by the Pound one of his ten favourite records of all time. John Lennon said he really liked the album during a radio interview, which the band took great encouragement from.|$|E
500|$|Slovak's {{work was}} one of the major {{contributing}} factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak, Kiedis likened the experience to [...] "shopping for a new Mom and Dad" [...] because of his influence over the band. [...] Flea, who originally listened exclusively to jazz, added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music, saying that [...] "it was Hillel who first <b>got</b> <b>me</b> <b>into</b> hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante, who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." [...] Just like Slovak before him, Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak, Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] (from Mother's Milk), [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] (from Blood Sugar Sex Magik), [...] "This is the Place" [...] (from By the Way), and [...] "Feasting on the Flowers" [...] (from The Getaway) were written about or as tributes to Slovak. The band's 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire", recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the [...] "Fight Like a Brave" [...] single and The Abbey Road EP, was included on 1989's Mother's Milk along with and image of one of Slovak's paintings inside the album's booklet. In 1999, a book titled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published. The book was authored by Slovak's brother, James Slovak, and features writings from his brother's diaries, paintings, photos and hand-written notes from Kiedis and Flea.|$|E

He helped teach the band [...] "not give a shit what anybody thought", according to Gunnulfsen. For one week in the studio, Harnage and Gunnulfsen were sifting through demos and deciding which of the material to work on. The group had 30 demos to work with. The demos were either [...] "rock-based" [...] or [...] "weird and electronic". Harnage and Gunnulfsen went with the latter, building upon them.
