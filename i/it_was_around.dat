By 1987, the total area has fallen to 2.87 acres and it was projected that it could lose another 12 inches each year until it disappears into the sea around 2026.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> {{this time}} that Edinburgh Zoo's now famous Penguin Parade was established. A zookeeper accidentally left a gate to the penguin pool open, and was {{followed}} around the zoo by a train of penguins. Visitors were so delighted with the procession that it became a regular occurrence, and today around {{two thirds of the}} zoo's penguins parade round the park every day.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as a testament to the loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E
5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|During {{its time}} in France, the brigade did not {{participate}} as a whole in any engagements, though its infantry and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces. On 11 October 1918 the 13th Brigade and 7th Division first came under shelling attacks. At Saint-Mihiel the units also came under chemical attack. Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River, capturing positions and driving German forces out of the region. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia, which the 13th Brigade wore {{as a part of}} the division.|$|E

5|$|Estianty {{was born}} in Surabaya, East Java, and showed {{interest}} in music at an early age, winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that she first met Dhani. After studying at the University of Indonesia, Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist. In 1999, she and Dhani {{came up with the}} idea for the musical duo Ratu. Estianty played the music, while other women– first Pinkan Mambo, then Mulan Jameela– sang. Ratu was highly successful. After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and a bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan. She is currently focusing on producing music with her label, Le Moesik.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Pepper {{was born}} in 1887, one of nine {{children}} in Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, a small town prospering from the instalment of the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway. He was educated at the local Ashwell and Chandos Street Schools, the latter amalgamating in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School. Customarily leaving school at 14, Frederick found employment with London and North Eastern Railway as a fireman; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time he found he had an aptitude for association football, and began playing professionally in 1908 aged 21.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} career as a bowling all-rounder. He made his Test debut in 1907, {{primarily}} as a left arm orthodox spinner who was considered to be a useful lower-middle order right-hand batsman. As Macartney was initially selected for his flexibility, his position in the batting order was frequently shuffled and he was largely ineffective. His most noteworthy Test contribution in his early career was a match-winning ten wicket haul at Headingley in 1909, before being dropped in the 1910–11 Australian season. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that Macartney befriended Trumper and began to transform himself from a bowler who batted in a defensive and technically correct manner, into an audacious attacking batsman. He reclaimed his Test position and made his maiden Test century in the same season, before establishing himself as the leading batsman in the team.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Dyer {{became a}} member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a {{patriotic}} society of civil war Union veterans. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments. His job as a commercial traveller brought him in touch with many veterans and officials, from whom he gathered official figures. The statistics he collected expanded into further areas, from regiments to details of formations, battles, movements, and similar data. He began to research using official records in various state capitals, and continued speaking to ex-soldiers and high-standing officers, such as General Sherman, who expressed interest in a comprehensive compendium and welcomed its future publication.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> {{this time}} that she {{switched}} from attending the local Congregational church, {{where she had been}} baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.|$|E

These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski {{arrived at}} Calcutta on 23 December 1945. After this time, the ship {{continued}} to sail in trooping duties in the Indian Ocean, though her specific movements are not known. In March 1946, Pułaski {{was purchased by}} the Ministry of War Transport for £100,000. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time the Polish crews of Pułaski and Kościuszko refused to be repatriated to Soviet-occupied Poland. The crew members all signed British articles. On 16 April 1946, Pułaski was formally handed over to British authorities, who renamed the vessel Empire Penryn: Empire to match the naming convention for miscellaneous British auxiliary ships; Penryn for the port of Penryn, Cornwall. Remaining under Lamport & Holt management, Empire Penryn performed trooping duties in the Mediterranean. The ship {{was taken out of}} service in 1948, and was scrapped at Blyth in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ about Morgan's {{activities}} in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued {{a letter of}} marque for the invasion of Curaçao, {{although he did not}} attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.|$|E

Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Kagame's family abandoned their home, living {{for two years in}} the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the Toro sub-region in 1962. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, Fred Rwigyema, first met one another.|$|E
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer was {{originally}} bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal.

At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it.
