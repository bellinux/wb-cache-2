40|$|Vertebral {{fracture}} risk is a heritable complex trait. The aim of {{this study}} was to identify genetic susceptibility factors for osteoporotic vertebral fractures applying a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. The GWAS discovery was based on the Rotterdam Study, a population-based study of elderly Dutch individuals aged > 55 years; and comprising 329 cases and 2, 666 controls with radiographic scoring (McCloskey-Kanis) and genetic data. Replication of one top-associated SNP was pursued by de-novo genotyping of 15 independent studies across Europe, the United States, Australia and one Asian study. Radiographic vertebral fracture assessment was performed using McCloskey-Kanis or Genant semi-quantitative definitions. SNPs were analyzed in relation to vertebral fracture using logistic regression models corrected for age and sex.

40|$|In {{countries}} {{confronting the}} issue of low fertility, as Japan is, dual trends showing higher regional population density associated with lower fertility rates are being confirmed. It is therefore an important theme for analysis to deepen discussions related to reducing regional fertility disparities by increasing fertility through the implementation of comprehensive childcare support policies, which might facilitate the striking of a balance between child-rearing and work, even in highly populated regions. As described herein, we constructed a simple theoretical two-region Overlapping Generations (OLG) by incorporating migration and land prices. Using it, we analyzed effects of population density and childcare services on fertility. Results elucidated the following three points. First, {{in the presence of}} congestion costs associated with increased population density, the fertility rate of the region decreases with increased population density. However, if the time cost of child-rearing is brought down by raising the level of the childcare services provided in the region, then the effect of increased population density on fertility can be restrained. Second, when the effect of population size on productivity is less than a certain level, improvement in the childcare services raises the relative ratio of the population density.

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} {{of the potential for}} contaminated soil remediation requires detailed knowledge of the fate of waste constituents within the soil environment. For many non-biodegradable organics compounds, photochemical degradation may provide a potential pathway for the removal of such compounds from soil surfaces. A study was conducted to evaluate the rate of photodegradation of ten hazardous organic compounds from three soils, silica gel, and four soil minerals (kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite, and calcite) under conditions of controlled irradiation. In addition, the <b>effect</b> of <b>siz</b> amendment treatments (methylene blue, riboflavin, hydrogen peroxide, diethylamine, peat moss, and silica gel) on the rates of compound loss was also investigated. Soil and mineral samples were spiked with various combinations of m-cresol, quinoline, biphenyl, dibenzo[a]furan, fluorene, pentachlorophenol, phenanthrene, anthracene, 9 H-carbazole and pyrene at either 500 or 1000 mg/kg initial soil concentration of each chemical. Amendments were applied to the soils and minerals and duplicate samples were irradiated in petri dishes under ultraviolet or visible light while spike controls were inclubated in the dark. Linear regression of soil/mineral contaminant concentration data showed that first order kinetic modeling best described the degradation process. Significant loss of anthracene occurred on all surfaces tested althrough the rate of loss varied with surface type and, for some surfaces, with the spiking solution concentration and chemical mixtures. Anthracene loss from silica gel was the msot rapid of all reactions observed. Skumpah soil, a light colored alkaline soil, yielded the greatest reduction in contaminant concentrations found in the soil studies. Calcium kaolinite displaed the most rapid kinetics of the mineral surfaces tested. Loss of the other test compounds was observed from only some of the surfaces investigated. Anthraquinone and fluorenone were identified as the major degradation products of the photoreaction of anthracene and fluorene. Under the conditions of this study, soild and mineral type, as well as surface renewal via mixing, were found to have more effect on degradation rates than any of the amendments that were tested...|$|R
40|$|Sperm length varies considerably, both {{between and}} within species, but the {{evolutionary}} {{implications of this}} variation are poorly understood. Sexual selection on sperm length requires a significant additive genetic variance, but few studies have actually measured this. Stylommatophoran gastropods have extraordinarily long sperm. However, the extent of intraspecific variation has rarely been examined. Here we present the first estimates of heritability of sperm length in the land snail Arianta arbustorum using two complementary approaches (one-parent-offspring regression and full-sibling split design). We also examined whether sperm length {{is influenced by the}} shell size of the snail and estimated heritability of shell size. Sperm delivered by the same individuals in 2 - 4 matings over two reproductive seasons did not differ in length, indicating a high repeatability of this trait. Offspring of 10 families were kept at three temperatures (11, 15 and 20 °C) to examine the influence of different environmental conditions on sperm length and adult shell breadth. Independent of shell breadth, sperm length was affected by temperature but not by family of origin (the variance component associated with family was not significantly different from zero), while adult shell breadth was influenced by temperature and family of origin. Higher temperatures resulted in shorter sperm, but larger shells. The heritability of sperm length derived from the two different approaches (one-parent-offspring regression: h 2 ± SE = 0. 52 ± 0. 55; full-sibling split design: H 2 ± SE = − 0. 19 ± 0. 28) suggests relatively little genetic variation in this trait in the studied population. In contrast, the heritability of adult shell breadth indicates a strong genetic effect (mother-offspring regression, h 2 ± SE = 0. 90 ± 0. 33). The heritability (h 2 ± SE) of adult shell breadth obtained from the father-offspring regression was 0. 18 ± 0. 42, i. e. five times smaller than that of the mother-offspring regression, suggesting a maternal <b>effect</b> on shell <b>siz...</b>|$|R
40|$|Existing {{knowledge}} of genetic variants affecting risk of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) is largely based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of 185 thousand CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6. 7 million common (MAF> 0. 05) as well as 2. 7 million low frequency (0. 005 <MAF< 0. 05) variants. In addition to confirmation of most known CAD loci, we identified 10 novel loci, eight additive and two recessive, that contain candidate genes that newly implicate biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intra-locus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small <b>effect</b> <b>siz...</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{inferential}} approach {{most widely}} used in psychological research, i. e. Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), has been subject to profound criticism accompanied by {{a renewed interest in}} alternative approaches.

Despite several studies have shown differences between the two approaches, little attention has been devoted to their commonalities. The current study aims to analyze the relation between the two approaches from both a mathematical and an applied perspective. As an illustrative example, we considered the independent samples t-test. In particular, the pvalue associated to NHST and the Bayes Factor (BF) derived from Bayesian approach were compared on different levels of sample size and effect size via Monte Carlo study. Results indicate that, even if the relation between p-value and BF is substantially deterministic, the interpretation of the two indices can lead to different decisions.

40|$|Meta-analysis (MA) is the {{quantitative}} integration of empirical studies {{that address the}} same or similar issues. It provides overall estimates of effect size, and can thus guide practical application of research findings. It can also identify moderating variables, and thus contribute to theorybuilding and research planning. It overcomes many of the disadvantages of null hypothesis significance testing. MA is a highly valuable way to review and summarise a research literature, and is now widely used in medicine and the social sciences. It is scarcely mentioned, however, in introductory statistics textbooks. I argue that MA should appear in the introductory statistics course, and I explain how software that provides diagrams based on confidence intervals can make many of the key concepts of MA readily accessible to beginning students.

Studies are needed to measure the effectiveness of continuing medical education (CME) on improving physician competency and performance toward evidence-based COPD care. Methods: Between September 26, 2009 and December 12, 2009, 769 primary care physicians participated in a series of 12 regional, live, interactive, case-based, multiformat, half-day CME programs on COPD. A subgroup of randomly selected participants (n = 50) and demographically matched nonparticipants (n = 50) completed surveys that included case vignettes, a validated tool for measuring physician performance in clinical practice. Cohen&# 39;s d was used to calculate the magnitude of difference between participants and nonparticipants in the delivery of evidence-based care. Results: Physicians who participated in CME programs were 50 % more likely to provide evidence-based COPD care than physicians who did not participate. Compared with nonparticipants, participating physicians were more likely to recognize COPD correctly in a patient presenting with dyspnea (74 % versus 94 %, P = 0. 007), recognize that women may have a greater susceptibility than men to the toxic effects of smoking (54 % versus 90 %, P &lt; 0. 001), and identify the mechanisms of action of emerging therapies (33 % versus 65 %, P = 0. 003). Conclusion: Physicians who participated in a half-day regional CME program on COPD diagnosis, staging, and treatment were significantly more likely than nonparticipants to deliver evidence-based COPD care. With multiformat, interactive, focused educational interventions, physicians can make diagnostic and therapeutic choices in the primary care setting that align more closely with current guidelines and clinical evidence in COPD management.

40|$|Introduction. Understanding {{the genetic}} {{architecture}} of scleroderma (SSc) susceptibility is vital both in gene discovery and {{in determining the}} influence of previously identified susceptibility variants. It is particularly important in understanding disease mechanism in a disease with few therapies and great morbidity and mortality. Methods. We selected 557 cases from the Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study (ASCS), for genotyping with the Immunochip, a custom Illumina Infinium genotyping array containing 196 524 rare and common variants shown {{to be important in}} a wide variety of autoimmune disorders. A total of 4537 controls were taken from the 1958 British Birth cohort. Genotype data were analysed with PLINK. Samples and SNPs with low call rates were excluded, as were SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium or with less than two occurrences of the minor allele. Eigenstrat was used to analyse population structure. The final data set consisted of 505 cases, 4491 controls and 146 867 SNPs. Allelic association analyses were conducted using Fisher's exact test. Genotype clusters were manually examined for all associations of P < 10 − 5 since calling is difficult for some rare variants. Results. Significant and suggestive associations were detected at seven loci. Several of these have been previously implicated in scleroderma susceptibility (HLA-DRB 1 and STAT 4) and several are novel associations, including SNPs near PXK (P = 4. 4 × 10 − 6) and CFDP 1 (P = 2. 6 × 10 − 6). The strongest associations were with SNPs in the Class II region of the MHC. One of the most strongly associated SNPs [rs 4639334; P = 1. 6 × 10 − 8; odds ratio (OR) = 1. 8] is in linkage disequilibrium (r 2 = 0. 46) with the Class II allele HLA-DRB 1 * 11 : 01. This allele has been associated with SSc. Another strongly associated SNP is rs 2857130 (P = 1. 6 × 10 − 8; OR = 0. 67), which lies in the promoter region of HLA-DRB 1, but is not in LD with any classical MHC alleles. Outside the MHC, there were six regions of association with P < 10 − 5,including the confirmed SSc locus at STAT 4. Several SNPs implicate a locus at PXK, which has been previously associated with SLE but not with SSc. The remaining associations are novel for both SSc and SLE and require replication. Of particular interest is a rare variant located within a non-coding RNA on chromosome 6 q 21 which was ∼ 20 times more frequent in cases than controls. We are currently dissecting the potential biological implications of this locus. Conclusions. This pilot study has confirmed previously reported SSc associations, revealed further genetic overlap between SSc and SLE, and identified putative novel SSc susceptibility loci including a rare allele with major <b>effect</b> <b>siz...</b>|$|E
