5|$|Set far in {{the future}} when {{humanity}} has left Earth, the plot follows Shion Uzuki, an employee of Vector Industries; and KOS-MOS, a battle android design to fight the hostile alien <b>Gnosis.</b> Forced to escape a <b>Gnosis</b> attack {{and head for the}} planet of Second Miltia, Shion and KOS-MOS are pulled into a fight between the Galaxy Federation and the hostile U-TIC Organization. With others who join them as they head to safety, they face a deeper mystery surrounding U-TIC's goals and the plans of the immortal Albedo Piazzolla.|$|E
5|$|The Elsa {{is pulled}} out of {{hyperspace}} and swallowed by a giant <b>Gnosis.</b> During their attempts to escape Cherenkov transforms into a <b>Gnosis.</b> The group are forced to kill the transformed Cherenkov before escaping on the Elsa and being rescued by Jr.. During the subsequent battle, KOS-MOS activates previously-unseen weaponry and absorbs the attacking <b>Gnosis.</b> While traveling with Jr., the group learn that the Kukai Foundation are gathering and storing the Zohar Emulators created by Mizrahi. Meanwhile, U-TIC uses agents within the Federation to doctor footage of Jr.'s battle with U-TIC and implicate the group {{in the destruction of}} the Woglinde. The group travel to the Kukai Foundation base above Second Miltia, operated by Jr.'s brother Gaignun. They are subsequently held hostage by Federation troops due to U-TIC's influence. With help from an ally of Gaignun, the group retrieve evidence from within KOS-MOS's memory center which can exonerate them.|$|E
5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from <b>gnosis,</b> secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Shion is {{aboard the}} Woglinde running tests on KOS-MOS when the crew {{pick up a}} Zohar Emulator, one of {{thirteen}} replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors her progress, {{but at the same}} time is a U-TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by <b>Gnosis.</b> KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Federation officer Luis Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and her assistant Allen. KOS-MOS brings them along with Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a <b>Gnosis</b> attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned that KOS-MOS is displaying aberrant behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's emotional state. Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U-TIC, as data stored inside her could open the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in a disaster for which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed. Ziggy rescues MOMO and narrowly escapes, fending off attacks by Margulis. Albedo, who is working with U-TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Monolith Soft {{and published by}} Namco (Namco Bandai Games in North America) for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. It is the final entry in both the Xenosaga trilogy and the larger Xenosaga series, which forms part of the Xeno franchise. Concluding the narrative of Xenosaga Episode I and Episode II, Episode III sees Shion Uzuki and the battle android KOS-MOS search out {{the origins of the}} hostile alien <b>Gnosis</b> while being hunted by Shion's former employers and four powerful humans called the Testaments. Gameplay is carried over from the first two games, featuring exploration of environments through a linear narrative, while battles follow a turn-based system featuring multiple leveling systems and combat with both a human party and mecha.|$|E
5|$|Abel, Nephilim, KOS-MOS {{and chaos}} choose {{to stay on}} Michtam, drawing all <b>Gnosis</b> to them and using a {{dimensional}} shift to move that region of space to Lost Jerusalem. Their actions {{and the release of}} chaos's Anima energy—which is accelerating the universe's death—will delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will and saving the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster-than-light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr. and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the mid and post-credit scenes, a badly-damaged KOS-MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they will both awake when they are needed. KOS-MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the <b>Gnosis</b> Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E
5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as {{it appears to be}} the source of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives with a private fleet that destroys the <b>Gnosis</b> and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape with a piece of data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Entering the {{hyperspace}} pocket, {{the group}} find the Elsa and investigate the area, encountering both Albedo and Virgil and learning that the Vessels of Anima powering their E.S. mecha {{are key to}} the Testaments' plans. They are then confronted by Mantel—who reveals himself as the Red Testament—and T-elos. T-elos almost kills KOS-MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to be a world within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS-MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall; her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U-TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered nearly everyone in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to resonate with the Zohar, summoning the <b>Gnosis</b> and awakening U-DO; it was only Mizrahi's self-sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febronia—who tended {{him when he was}} injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her death—and follows her into the afterlife. The Red Testament also appears, revealing his true identity as Kevin and asking Shion to join him.|$|E
5|$|With {{the way to}} Miltia opened, the Federation, U-TIC, and the Immigrant Fleet fight {{each other}} {{for control of the}} Zohar hidden on the planet. Shion and Allen attempt to reach Miltia, but are almost {{destroyed}} by U-TIC forces and only saved due to KOS-MOS's spontaneous activation and intervention. With help from Gaignun and the Second Miltia government, the group then launch an assault with the Elsa, destroying the Immigrant Fleet mothership before being rescued by Gaignun as the space-time distortion around Miltia vanishes. Joined by Jin and Canaan, they unlock the data within Canaan, revealing that the Immigrant Fleet has funded U-TIC since its inception, and that MOMO's father Mizrahi sacrificed himself to seal Miltia away after Albedo released the energy U-DO. After a skirmish with Margulis, the group find the Zohar and two deformed comatose Realians used to control its energy: these are Cecily and Cathe. Shion reluctantly allows KOS-MOS to kill Cecily and Cathe. The Zohar is claimed by Sergius in behalf of Ormus and the Immigrant Fleet. He installs the Zohar into the Proto Omega, a giant machine built within the structure of Miltia, with the intent of destroying the <b>Gnosis</b> and Federation so Ormus will be free to rediscover Lost Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|In Christian mysticism, Shekhinah became mystery, Da'at became <b>gnosis,</b> {{and poverty}} became an {{important}} component of monasticism.|$|E
25|$|A mage's power, or {{level of}} {{awakening}} {{and understanding of}} the depths of the Supernal, is called <b>Gnosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, Gnosticism was harshly {{rejected}} by Christians and c. 180 Irenaeus wrote against them at length in his On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called <b>Gnosis,</b> generally called Against Heresies. By {{the third century}} non-Christian Indians were also considered heretics by the Christians who condemned their practices.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{approached}} Gnosticism from {{a psychological}} perspective, which {{was followed by}} Gilles Quispel. According to this approach, Gnosticism is a map for the human development, in which an undivided person, centered on the Self, develops out of the fragmentary personhood of young age. According to Quispel, <b>gnosis</b> is a third force in western culture, alongside faith and reason, which offers an experiential awareness of this Self.|$|E
25|$|The Cathars (Cathari, Albigenses or Albigensians) {{were also}} accused by their {{enemies of the}} traits of Gnosticism; though {{whether or not the}} Cathari possessed direct {{historical}} influence from ancient Gnosticism is disputed. If their critics are reliable the basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology {{are to be found in}} Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser, Satanic, creator god), though they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (<b>gnosis)</b> as an effective salvific force.|$|E
25|$|Cerinthus (c. 100 AD), {{the founder}} of a heretical school with gnostic elements. Like a Gnostic, Cerinthus {{depicted}} Christ as a heavenly spirit separate from the man Jesus, and he cited the demiurge as creating the material world. Unlike the Gnostics, Cerinthus taught Christians to observe the Jewish law; his demiurge was holy, not lowly; and he taught the Second Coming. His <b>gnosis</b> was a secret teaching attributed to an apostle. Some scholars believe that the First Epistle of John was written {{as a response to}} Cerinthus.|$|E
25|$|For {{the western}} world, this idea {{developed}} into a religion which spawned many sects, some of which embraced an extreme dualistic belief that the material world should be shunned and the spiritual world should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many ancient religions which teach that <b>gnosis</b> (variously interpreted as enlightenment, salvation, emancipation or 'oneness with God') may be reached by practising philanthropy {{to the point of}} personal poverty, sexual abstinence (as far as possible for , total for initiates) and diligently searching for wisdom by helping others.|$|E
25|$|For Nizari {{reasoning}} is arrived at through a dialectic between revelation and human reasoning, {{based on a}} synergy of Islamic scripture and classical Greek philosophy, in particular Aristotelean reasoning and Platonic metaphysics. It seeks to extend an understanding of religion and revelation to identify the outwardly apparent (zahir), and also to penetrate to the roots, to retrieve and disclose that which is the inner underlying (batin). This process of discovery engages both the intellect ('aql) and the spirit (ruh), operating in an integral synergy to illuminate and disclose truths (haqi'qat) culminating in <b>gnosis</b> (ma'rifat).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the stage {{production}} is that the audience is watching genderqueer rockstar Hedwig Robinson's musical act as she follows rockstar Tommy Gnosis's (much more successful) tour around the country. Occasionally Hedwig opens a door onstage to listen to Gnosis's concert, which is playing in an adjoining venue. <b>Gnosis</b> is recovering from an incident that nearly ruined his career, having crashed his car into a school bus while high and receiving oral sex from none other than Hedwig herself. Capitalizing on her notoriety from the incident, Hedwig determines to tell the audience her story ("Tear Me Down").|$|E
25|$|Hedwig {{grows more}} erratic and {{unstable}} {{as the evening}} progresses, until she finally breaks down, stripping off her wig, dress, and make-up, forcing Yitzhak {{to step forward and}} sing ("Hedwig's Lament"/"Exquisite Corpse"). At the height of her breakdown, she seems to transform into Tommy <b>Gnosis,</b> who both begs for and offers forgiveness in a reprise of the song she wrote for him ("Wicked Little Town (Reprise)"). Hedwig, out of costume, finds acceptance within herself, giving her wig to Yitzhak. At peace, Hedwig departs the stage as Yitzhak takes over her final song, dressed fabulously in drag ("Midnight Radio").|$|E
25|$|Reuss met Aleister Crowley and in 1910 {{admitted}} him to {{the first}} three degrees of O.T.O. Only two years later, Crowley was placed in charge of Great Britain and Ireland, and was advanced to the X° (tenth degree). The appointment included {{the opening of the}} British section of O.T.O., which was called the Mysteria Mystica Maxima or the M∴M∴M∴. Crowley then went to Berlin to obtain instructional manuscripts and the title of Supreme and Holy King of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains within the Sanctuary of the <b>Gnosis.</b> Within the year, Crowley had written the Manifesto of the M∴M∴M∴ which described its basic ten-degree system with Kellner’s three degree Academia Masonica forming the seventh, eighth and ninth degrees.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual <b>gnosis</b> and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential <b>gnosis</b> is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring <b>gnosis</b> and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E
25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that <b>gnosis</b> (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

500|$|While inside KOS-MOS's memory, {{the group}} are guided through a dream-like realm {{constructed}} from their repressed bad memories, {{all the way}} observed by Nephilim, with whom chaos is acquainted. Shion also meets a vision of Febronia, a Realian woman killed in the Miltian Conflict, who asks Shion to [...] "free" [...] her sisters Cecily and Cathe {{for the sake of}} both humans and Realians. Before fulfilling their mission, Nephilim tells them that KOS-MOS was designed to stop the energies of U-DO from entering their reality, an event which caused the original planet Miltia to vanish into a space-time void and could potentially destroy the universe. Due to surviving a <b>Gnosis</b> encounter and remaining human, Shion has the capacity to change the future for the better.

500|$|A key {{episode in}} the game's backstory is the Miltian Conflict, which {{occurred}} fourteen years before the events of Episode I on the planet Miltia; beginning due to a war between U-TIC and the Federation, it escalated due {{to a group of}} Realians going berserk and attacking people indiscriminately. The planet of Miltia was lost in a space-time anomaly when an experiment involving U.R.T.Vs—an army of 669 genetically modified children designed to combat U-DO's energies—goes horribly wrong. During the events of Xenosaga Episode I, main protagonist Shion Uzuki and her creation the anti-Gnosis android KOS-MOS are forced to escape an <b>Gnosis</b> attack triggered by the discovery of a Zohar Emulator, a manmade copy of the Zohar. During their journey to Second Miltia aboard the passenger freighter Elsa, they are pursued by U-TIC forces; encounter more <b>Gnosis</b> seeking the Zohar Emulator; and Shion experiences visions of a young girl named Nephilim. Sheltering with the Kulai Foundation, they are eventually forced to confront Albedo Piazzolla, an unhinged U.R.T.V. determined to reach Miltia, when he threatens Second Miltia with a powerful weapon called the Proto Merkabah. The group destroy the Proto Merkabah, but Albedo escapes with data that could open the way to Miltia. During Xenosaga Episode II, Albedo succeeds in accessing Miltia, using the conflict between Ormus and the Federation to access a powerful mech called the Proto Omega. The Testaments grant him access to the Zohar, forcing party member and fellow U.R.T.V. Jr. to kill him. Following the defeat of the Proto Omega, the Zohar is absorbed by a giant ship dubbed [...] "Abel's Ark". Over the next year, Shion learns that Vector and her father were directly involved the U-TIC's activities, resigning from Vector following a series of <b>Gnosis</b> attacks dubbed the [...] "Gnosis Terrorism".|$|E
500|$|In Christian Gnosticism (now {{a largely}} extinct {{religious}} movement), Jesus was sent from the divine realm {{and provided the}} secret knowledge (<b>gnosis)</b> necessary for salvation. Most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of [...] "the Christ" [...] at his baptism. This spirit left Jesus' body during the crucifixion, but was rejoined {{to him when he}} was raised from the dead. Some Gnostics, however, were docetics, believed that Jesus did not have a physical body, but only appeared to possess one. Manichaeism, a Gnostic sect, accepted Jesus as a prophet, in addition to revering Gautama Buddha and Zoroaster.|$|E

The planet of Miltia was lost in a space-time anomaly when an experiment involving U.R.T.Vs—an army of 669 genetically modified children designed to combat U-DO's energies—goes horribly wrong. Following the apparent destruction of Miltia, new settlements and a new government are established on a neighboring planet named Second Miltia. During the events of Episode I, main protagonist Shion Uzuki and her creation the anti-Gnosis android prototype KOS-MOS are forced to escape a <b>Gnosis</b> attack triggered by the discovery of a Zohar Emulator. During their journey to Second Miltia aboard the passenger freighter Elsa, they are pursued by U-TIC forces; encounter more <b>Gnosis</b> seeking the Zohar Emulator; and Shion experiences visions of a young girl named Nephilim and a deceased friend Febronia, the latter of whom asks her to [...] "free" [...] her sisters Cecily and Cathe.

Episode II picks up immediately after the ending of Episode I, when the Elsa arrives on Miltia.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, Xenosaga Episode II {{takes place}} in a {{universe}} based around science fiction. In the year [...] "20XX", the Zohar—an artifact dating {{from the beginning of the}} universe which connects to the realm of a god-like energy dubbed U-DO—was unearthed by an archeological expedition in Kenya; the Zohar is key to enabling humanity to travel in space beyond the Solar System. Over 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth behind to colonize the galaxy following a terrible event, resulting in Earth's location being lost and the planet being dubbed [...] "Lost Jerusalem": by the game's events, humanity has adopted a new calendar system dubbed [...] "Transcend Christ" [...] (T.C.), with the game's events taking place in T.C. 4767—equivalent to A.D. 7277. Humanity is now spread across 500,000 planets, with their governments forming the Galaxy Federation. Planets are connected through a time warp travel network called the Unus Mundus Network (U.M.N.). The U.M.N. is managed by Vector Industries, which also controls interests in the Federations military. Existing alongside humans are Realians, synthetic humans who hold equal status with natural humans. The Federation has come under attack from an ancient alien race called the <b>Gnosis,</b> which begin decimating Federation worlds. As normal weapons are ineffective against them, Vector develops two different weapon systems designed to fight them: humanoid mecha dubbed AGWS (Anti <b>Gnosis</b> Weapon System), and the similar but more powerful KOS-MOS battle androids. There also exist more advanced AGWS models called E.S., powered by Lost Jerusalem artifacts called Vessels of Anima. Important organizations include the Kukai Foundation, a group that acts as a shelter for enhanced humans; the U-TIC Organization, a once-scientific group that now wishes to gain control of the Zohar; and Ormus, a secretive cult who worship Lost Jerusalem which secretly funds U-TIC and operations through a political faction called the Immigrant Fleet.|$|E
