State Secretary Kjell Hansen was opposed to the proposal and on 30 April 1985 Parliament cut the subsidies, hindering additional <b>gangue</b> breaking. This caused Hübert to resign and he was replaced by Oddmund Husum. Parliament's decision caused a strike and all production was halted on 2 May.

Calcite <b>gangues</b> in mineralized (argillaceous/barite-bearing) tectonites and tectonite ores contain the highest REE values and exhibit convex-upward and roughly roof-shaped REE patterns with positive Eu anomalies, which are typical of hydrothermal crustal fluids. Negative Ce and negative La anomalies in calcite <b>gangues</b> imply hydrothermal fluids that previously interacted with marine and terrigenous rocks underlying the carbonate host rocks. Similarities in the REE characteristics of mineralized tectonites {{with those of the}} non-altered wallrocks and non-mineralized tectonites support earlier propositions that hydrothermal fluids were derived from the Kunyang Group basement rocks. REE characteristics of mineralized (argillaceous/barite-bearing) tectonites indicate fluid-wallrock interactions during migration of hydrothermal fluids along faults. Convex-upward REE patterns of tectonite ores were likely due to remobilization of early-formed base-metal sulphides whereas convex-upward REE patterns of strongly mineralized tectonites (i. e. with disseminated–massive base-metal sulphides) were likely due to recrystallization of early formed calcite <b>gangues.</b> REE characteristics of altered tectonites due to fluid-rock interactions during fluid migration and metal/mineral remobilization/recrystallization are depicted in Y/Ho–La/Ho, Tb/Ca–Tb/La, and Yb/Ca–Yb/La plots of the data.

25|$|Three {{processes}} {{were involved}} in extracting lead from the ore brought out of the mine. First the ore had to be crushed to liberate the galena in it from the <b>gangue</b> minerals. Then the galena was separated from the other minerals, using some form of gravity separation process, or (after 1938) a froth flotation process. Finally the concentrated galena was smelted in a furnace to extract the metallic lead from it.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main {{utilization}} mode of titano-magnetite was firstly separating titano-magnetite by low intensity {{magnetic separation}}, then concentrating ilmenite from magnetic separation tailings. Magnetic separation tailings mainly contained ilmenite, {{but there was}} still a small quantity of titano-magnetite. Magnetic agglomeration of titanomagnetite occured because of existentence of remanence and pre-flotation grinding. It was found that titanomagnetite presented more optimal floatability than ilmenite. Therefore some <b>gangues</b> wrapped by titano-magnetite went into the floatation concentrate.

The recovery of copper concentrate is much lower than the Cu recovery of roughing concentrate from the condition experiments.

25|$|When the Lucy Tongue Level was {{completed}} in 1869, its entrance was below the ore hoppers {{at the foot of}} the incline from the Low Horse Level. A water-powered incline was built to take the ore up to those hoppers, though this involved a considerable amount of reorganisation in the area. Labour shortages in 1870 led to further mechanisation of the labour-intensive ore washing. A new oscillating jaw crusher eliminated the need for initial hand-knocking of the ore, and was powered by a high-pressure water turbine. Hotching tubs, even when mechanised, still needed constant supervision, and were replaced by newly-available automated fixed-sieve jigging machines. These still involved forcing water up and down through the bed of ore, but the sieves, covered with a three-inch (76mm) layer of galena, were stationary; material of the same density passed through the bed but lighter material was washed into the next sieve down the line.

In this paper, the engineering mechanical characteristics of superhigh-water content material concretion (SCMC) were studied for two types of backfilling technologies in longwall mining—open-type and pocket-type backfilling. The mechanical properties and responses of the SCMC were assessed under different cementation states, varying loading conditions and at different scales. The results indicate that: (1) the compressive and tensile strengths of SCMC specimens in different cementation states increase as the curing time increases—the SCMC formed by a mixture of SCM and <b>gangues</b> has higher strength than that of pure SCM; (2) the SCMC is under different loading and confinement conditions when different backfilling technologies is applied; however the strength of SCMC increases with curing time and decreases with water volume percentage; and (3) large-size specimens of pure SCMC enter into an accelerated creep state at a leveled load of 1. 4 MPa.

This study investigated the Rhodococcus opacus (R. opacus) adsorption behavior on the surfaces of calcite, serpentine, and dolomite by bioadhesive test, contact angle measurements, Zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that R. opacus could be absorbed well onto the surfaces of calcite, serpentine, and dolomite in a few minutes, with adsorption rate up to 96 %. The cell adsorption was dependent on the pH value and the most suitable pH is 7. 2, whereas no significant influence of temperature on adsorption was found. Increasing pulp density could provide more adsorption sites to R. opacus cells and increase the adsorption rate consequently. The contact angle of three minerals decreased after R. opacus attached, which indicated that the dispersibility of the mineral surface was improved and in favor of being separated. Zeta potential measurements showed that the cell with the charge was opposite to that of minerals on a broad of pH value. The SEM images showed that R. opacus attached very tightly onto the mineral surface, with a large number of small mineral particles gathered around the cell.
