Therefore, soil organic carbon research is gaining momentum in the Mediterranean basin. Our objective is to quantify effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) in three soil types (Vertisol, Cambisol, and Luvisol) within Central Morocco. Chemical analyses {{were used to determine}} how tillage affected various humic substances. Our results showed that, after 5 years, surface horizon (0 – 30 [*]cm) SOC stocks varied between tillage systems and with soil type. The SOCs was significantly higher in NT compared to CT (10 % more in Vertisol and 8 % more in Cambisol), but no significant difference was observed in the Luvisol. Average SOCs within the 0 – 30 [*]cm depth was 29. 35 and 27. 36 [*]Mg ha− 1 under NT and CT, respectively. The highest SOCs (31. 89 [*]Mg ha− 1) was found in Vertisols under NT. A comparison of humic substances showed that humic acids and humin were significantly higher under NT compared to CT, but fulvic acid concentrations were significantly lower.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of alumina is an inherent problem in Solid Rocket Motors (SRM). In the V on Karman Institute this problem {{have been studied}} using a scale model of Ariane 5 booster where alumina is modeled with water. The Stokes number is maintained. After a parametric test, the relevant parameter found {{to be responsible for}} the entrapment of particles, was the horizontal distance between the tip of the isolation ring (inhibitor) and the nozzle tip. This parameter is named as Obstacle tip to Nozzle tip (OT 2 NT). The problem found during Tóth investigation was that {{a large part of the}} water accumulation in the cavity was due to the dripping of the inhibitor. The rst objective of the experimental part have been to reduce the dripping modifying the inhibitor design. The design found to minimize the dripping is the one with no extra absorbing material and a wider top plate (24 mm). A posteriori, a parametric tests was <b>done.</b> OT 2 <b>NT</b> <b>has</b> been con rmed to be the main responsible while the entrapment for the new system is around a half of Tóth results. The aim of the numerical part have been to apply an existent code, Open-Foam twoPhaseEulerFoam library, based on the nite volumes. Then this code have been modi ed in order to handle with ve dispersed phases with different properties, named as sixP haseEulerFoam. The codes have been verificated through a direct comparison with existing publications. Then a sensitivity study to numerical parameters has been done. For twoPhaseEulerFoam it has been found than the results are close to the existing ones while for the sixP haseEulerFoam although the behavior of the solution is the one expected, its values are overestimated giving only a qualitatively valid answer to the problem. Finally, twophaseEulerFoam is applied to the booster geometry studied in the experimental part. Due to the fact that OT 2 <b>NT</b> <b>has</b> been determined as the main responsible for the entrapment, three different geometries showing three different OT 2 NT (25 : 69, - 4 : 31 and - 25 : 91 mm) values have been tested.

Methods: We tested the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative expected values of each marker {{with the aim of}} setting a model for prenatal screening readings. Statistical data treatment has been performed on a sample of 340 pregnant women with positive results of prenatal screening. Results: Sensitivity of PAPP-A was 0. 6250 (probability 62. 50 %), free beta HCG 0. 5893 (58. 93 %), NT 0. 1785 (17. 85 %). Specificity of PAPP-A was 0. 5106 (probability 51. 06 %), free beta HCG 0. 5246 (52. 46 %), NT 0. 9718 (97. 18 %). Positive expected value of PAPP-A was 0. 2011 (probability 20. 11 %), free beta HCG 0. 1964 (19. 64 %), NT 0. 556 (55. 56 %). Negative expected value of PAPP-A was 0. 8735 (probability 87. 35 %), free beta HCG 0. 8662 (86. 62 %), NT 0. 8571 (85. 71 %). The <b>NT</b> marker <b>has</b> a significantly higher specificity, which means that its normal value will significantly reduce the final risk of trisomy 21. The sensitivity of NT is much lower than that of biochemical markers, which means that a pathological value of <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not <b>have</b> a significant influence on the final risk, i. e. the significantly higher sensitivity of biochemical markers will reduce the final risk of trisomy 21. Conclusion: The analyses stress the importance of using a software which has the possibility to separate the level of a biochemical risk by correlating PAPP-A and free beta HCG and, by adding the NT marker, calculate the level of a final risk of Down syndrome...|$|R
