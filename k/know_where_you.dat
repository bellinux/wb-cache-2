5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> begin. You never <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are going to end.|$|E

So, you don't really <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. A piece will look like a street in London, but {{a portion of the}} {{architecture}} looks like New York, but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city. You're there, but you don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. It's like every time you travel, you'll be lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{music from}} the film is largely orchestral in nature, {{although}} it includes two moderately successful pop singles ("I'm Still Here" [...] and [...] "Always <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Are") from The Goo Goo Dolls frontman John Rzeznik and British pop-rock group, BBMak. Both songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik in the film, but BBMak recorded [...] "Always <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Are" [...] for the soundtrack. The score was composed by James Newton Howard, {{who said that the}} score is [...] "very much in the wonderful tradition of Korngold and Tiomkin and Steiner." [...] The score {{has been described as a}} mixture of modern music in the spirit of Star Wars and Celtic music. Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser is credited as the co-composer of the track [...] "Silver Leaves", and is also listed as a soloist in the film's credits. Walt Disney Records released the film's soundtrack album on November 19, 2002.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, the band ran a contest on MTV. The contest was called, [...] "Lost Weekend" [...] with Van Halen. Fans mailed over 1 million postcards to MTV {{in hopes of}} winning the contest. In the promo for MTV, David Lee Roth said, [...] "You won't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, you won't know what's going to happen, and when you come back, you're not gonna have any memory of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did {{not share}} their mother's enthusiasm for the war. As {{committed}} pacifists, they rejected the WSPU's support for the government. Sylvia's socialist perspective convinced her {{that the war was}} another example of capitalist oligarchs exploiting poor soldiers and workers. Adela, meanwhile, spoke against the war in Australia and made public her opposition to conscription. In a short letter, Emmeline told Sylvia: [...] "I am ashamed to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> and Adela stand." [...] She had a similar impatience for dissent within the WSPU; when long-time member Mary Leigh asked a question during a meeting in October 1915, Pankhurst replied: [...] "hat woman is a pro German and should leave the hall.... I denounce you as a pro German and wish to forget that such a person ever existed." [...] Some WSPU members were outraged by this sudden rigid devotion to the government, the leadership's perceived abandonment of efforts to win the vote for women, and questions about how funds collected on behalf of suffrage were being managed with regard to the organisation's new focus. Two groups split from the WSPU: The Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU), each dedicated to maintaining pressure toward women's suffrage.|$|E
500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are going to go. But once you figure that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E

50|$|Better than <b>Knowing</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Are is {{the fourth}} and final album from Chicago pop-punk band Spitalfield. It was {{released}} on October 3, 2006 through Victory Records.|$|R
500|$|The track [...] "Receptacle For the Respectable" [...] {{reflects}} the eclecticism {{of the album}} as it [...] "undergoes a complete personality change" [...] {{over the course of}} its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys' Smiley Smile album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a [...] "pantomime death metal" [...] section with Rhys's [...] "distorted, bellowed vocals" [...] screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by [...] "pissing about with Pro Tools", looping the bass {{from the end of the}} third section [...] "by accident" [...] to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that [...] "if you're going to do a fifth bit, you'd probably do a sixth, and before you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are, you're doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits!". According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and [...] "completely went with [...] silly streak".|$|E

The band began their Heaven Upside Down Tour on July 20, 2017 in Budapest. The first single from the album, [...] "We <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Fucking Live", was released on September 11, with the album due to follow on October 6.

On 12 May there were clashes between loyalists and nationalists on Woodhouse Street. On 27 May there were clashes between nationalists and police after a junior Orange march on the lower Garvaghy Road.|$|E
2500|$|A United Press {{correspondent}} described Robinson's {{speech as}} [...] "the most unrestrained language that ever has been {{heard in the}} Senate."

Near the conclusion of his speech, Robinson violated the custom of the Senate and addressed his colleague directly, pointing at La Follette and shouting, [...] "I want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> stand." [...] La Follette {{was not allowed to}} take the floor to refute the other Senators before adjournment, though Senator Fall allowed him a brief statement, whereupon he announced he was prepared to substantiate everything he said in St. Paul and desired the chance to rebut the charges being made against him by his fellow senators. Throughout the remainder of his term in the Senate, his opponents used procedural maneuvers to ensure he never was allowed to address charges of disloyalty again.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study in}} 2008 {{concluded}} that a contributing factor to the Israeli Defense Force's defeat in the Israeli-Hezbollah Conflict in the Summer of 2006 was {{due in large part}} to an over reliance on EBO concepts. However, contrary to this opinion, Dag Henriksen, PhD, Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy, highlights the reality that [...] "the absence of a clearly identified military strategy for war or of one’s objectives reduces the relevance of the concept of EBO—or, indeed, of any military concept. In other words, if you do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are going, the means to get there is hardly the key problem. Thus, one risks cherry-picking the variable (in this case EBO) that actually played a subordinate role in the negative outcome for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during this conflict. Logically, these factors render this particular conflict largely unsuitable as an empirical foundation for harshly criticizing EBO." [...] Henriksen's study finds that the Israeli campaign in 2006 does not provide sufficient empirical evidence of flaws in EBO.|$|E
2500|$|... "Via, Veritas, Vita" [...] is a Latin phrase {{which means}} “The Way, The Truth, and The Life.” Chosen by the University as its motto, this phrase is {{attributed}} to Jesus Christ and {{is found in the}} Gospel of John chapter 14, verse 6, which reads “5Thomas said to him, [...] "Lord, we don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are going, so how can we know the way?" [...] 6Jesus answered, [...] "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him." [...] (New International Version) [...] The choice of the motto is firmly rooted in the University’s belief that religious instruction, particularly in the teachings of Jesus Christ, is essential to the moral development of every young person. [...] Incidentally, the motto has been adopted by the Province of Negros Oriental by incorporating it in its provincial seal.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S., [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] {{was issued}} as the album's first single, with an {{accompanying}} music video. Initially, the album and single lingered {{for almost a}} year without performing well, but when Geffen founder David Geffen was asked to lend support to the band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they were coming out of a bus into New York. Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!" [...] The song was featured in the 1988 Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool, starring Clint Eastwood, and members of the band had a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
