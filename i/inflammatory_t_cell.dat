40|$|Background: Hepatic gene transfer, in {{particular}} using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, {{has been shown}} to induce immune tolerance to several protein antigens. This approach has been exploited in animal models of inherited protein deficiency for systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. Adequate levels of transgene expression in hepatocytes induce a suppressive T cell response, thereby promoting immune tolerance. This study addresses the question of whether AAV gene transfer can induce tolerance to a cytoplasmic protein. Major Findings: AAV- 2 vector-mediated hepatic gene transfer for expression of cytoplasmic b-galactosidase (b-gal) was performed in immune competent mice, followed by a secondary b-gal gene transfer with E 1 /E 3 -deleted adenoviral Ad-LacZ vector to provoke a severe immunotoxic response.

This may reflect a regulatory mechanism {{that seems to be}} essential for the selflimitation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses as it has been shown in disease models such as leishmaniosis or toxoplasmosis. In our group we could recently show that the Notch signalling pathway is a main regulator of IL- 10 production by TH 1 cells. In the present work, the mechanism of the Notch-mediated IL- 10 induction has been further investigated in vivo. The results of the present thesis demonstrate that the Notch signalling pathway also plays a prominent role in the regulation of the self limitation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses by the induction of IL- 10 in TH 1 cells in vivo. IL- 10 induction in TH 1 cells could be induced by an immunisation with Ovalbumin and Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG in vivo and was strongly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling. The contribution of the individual Notch ligands for IL- 10 induction in TH 1 cells in vivo was further investigated by the application of Notch ligand blocking antibodies and the given results clearly suggest that IL- 10 induction in vivo is dependent on the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll- 4). Hence, it was examined which subset of antigen presenting cells (APC) expresses the Notch ligand Dll- 4 and could therefore be involved in the IL- 10 induction in vivo. Interestingly, the expression of Dll- 4 was found to be largely restricted to the APC subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and was selectively acquired upon stimulation with Toll-like receptor 9 ligand CpG in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, pDC, compared to other APC subsets, were most efficient in inducing IL- 10 production by TH 1 cells both in vitro and in vivo in a Dll- 4 /Notch dependent manner. The present thesis describes a mechanism by which pDC can regulate an immune response by inducing IL- 10 production by TH 1 cells. The given data contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the self limitation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses and has implications for future therapeutic interventions for TH 1 driven autoimmune diseases. This can be done by strengthening the IL- 10 production of potentially autoreactive TH 1 cells by activation of Notch either by stimulation with Notch antibodies or recombinant Dll- 4 or a vaccination with Dll- 4 expressing pDC. On the other hand one could block Notch/Dll- 4 interactions in chronic infections or in tumor models where IL- 10 expression is undesirable, to enable an appropriate immune response...|$|E

We report that GSH is essential for T cell effector functions through its regulation of metabolic activity. Conditional gene targeting of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclc) blocked GSH production specifically in murine T cells. Gclc-deficient T cells initially underwent normal activation but could not meet their increased energy and biosynthetic requirements. GSH deficiency compromised the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin- 1 (mTOR) and expression of NFAT and Myc transcription factors, abrogating the energy utilization and Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming that allows activated T cells to switch to glycolysis and glutaminolysis.

The cancer cells grow inside this stroma, forming a tumor that provides their vascular supply and protects them from cellular immune response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTLR sense {{microbial}} infections, {{and control}} activation of immune responses. Dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes express TLR and the TLR-signaling adaptor protein MyD 88. The impact of TLR-activated B cells on T cell-mediated inflammation is unknown. In this study, {{we have used}} mice carrying B cell-restricted deficiencies in MyD 88 or in distinct TLR to {{examine the impact of}} TLR-activated B cells on a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that TLR-signaling in B cells suppresses <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses (both Th 1 and Th 17), and stimulates recovery from EAE. Only certain TLR are required on B cells for resolution of EAE, and these are dispensable for disease initiation, indicating that a category of TLR agonists preferentially triggers a suppressive function in B cells and thereby limits autoimmune disease. The TLR agonists controlling the regulatory function of B cells are provided by components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis present in the adjuvant. Thus, MyD 88 signaling in B cells antagonizes MyD 88 signaling in other cells, which drives differentiation of Th 17 cells and is required for induction of EAE. Altogether, our data indicate that B cells link recognition of microbial products via TLR to suppression of a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{associations between}} B and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypic profiles and antibody {{responses to the}} pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV 5) in perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) infants on antiretroviral therapy and in HIV-exposed uninfected (PHEU) infants enrolled in International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials P 1072 study (NCT 00880698). Of 17 B and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subsets analyzed, PHIV and PHEU differed only {{in the number of}} CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and frequency of naive B cells, which were higher in PHEU than in PHIV. In contrast, the B and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypic profiles of PHIV and PHEU markedly differed from those of geographically matched contemporary HIV-unexposed infants. The frequency of regulatory <b>T</b> and B <b>cells</b> (Treg, Breg) of PHIV and PHEU displayed two patterns of associations: FOXP 3 + CD 25 + Treg positively correlated with CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> numbers; while TGFβ+ Treg and IL 10 + Treg and Breg positively correlated with the frequencies of <b>inflammatory</b> and activated <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, the frequencies of activated and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> of PHIV and PHEU positively correlated with the frequency of immature B cells. Correlations were not affected by HIV status and persisted over time. PHIV and PHEU antibody responses to RV 5 positively correlated with CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> counts and negatively with the proportion of immature B cells, similarly to what has been previously described in chronic HIV infection. Unique to PHIV and PHEU, anti-RV 5 antibodies positively correlated with CD 4 +/CD 8 +FOXP 3 +CD 25 +% and negatively with CD 4 +IL 10 +% Tregs. In conclusion, PHEU shared with PHIV abnormal B and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypic profiles. PHIV and PHEU antibody responses to RV 5 were modulated by typical HIV-associated immune response modifiers except for the association between CD 4 +/CD 8 +FOXP 3 +CD 25 +Treg and increased antibody production...|$|R
5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>inflammatory</b> properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|R
