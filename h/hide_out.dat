5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who {{followed}} through with the plan and was later killed), and {{that he needed to}} leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to <b>hide</b> <b>out.</b> Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E

5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> until she had given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> at an international network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E

5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Niš in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January– February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E

25|$|Prizefighting {{had become}} quite {{sophisticated}} in Tombstone and in October 1883 McLeod beat the then champion Young in four rounds and {{was awarded a}} $400 prize. McLeod also maintained good relations with Judge Aaron H. Hackney in Globe by helping the Judge's friends caught in the feud, including Frederick Russell Burnham, leave the Tonto Basin to <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> in Tombstone. In August 1884, McLeod was assassinated in Nacosair, Sonora, Mexico by James Powers.|$|E

He was regarded as handsome with blue eyes and was known to be charismatic and likeable. He bought an apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and a Tudor home in Scarsdale.

25|$|The Oldtown {{area has}} a proud {{industrial}} history with it being {{the location of}} many of the town's major employers. Former industries in the area include the Model Bakery and the Gaeltex Factory. Current employers in the area include Dunnes Stores, NowDoc, Jungle King and The <b>Hide</b> <b>Out</b> Bar (Oldtown Inn), which was established in the 19th century. The pub was redeveloped in 2008 and was awarded the most improved public house by the then Minister for the Environment, John Gormley. However, the new owner John G. Larkin, has links with Dessie Larkin, the Fianna Fáil mayor and councillor (Gormley was in coalition with Fianna Fáil at this time).|$|E
25|$|Settlement in {{the area}} after the English ejected the Dutch was slow. The Swedes and Finns who had settled {{in the area}} {{from the days of}} New Sweden had {{generally}} welcomed the English and were allowed to stay; the few Dutch found in the area were rounded up as prisoners and sent to Virginia as slaves. Lord Baltimore encouraged Marylanders to move east to settle the area. But the land was far removed from other, more established settlements and did not appeal to many new settlers. It was a tempting wilderness base for pirates to <b>hide</b> <b>out</b> from authorities and regularly pillage settlers for supplies.|$|E

25|$|One {{point that}} the French had a major problem with was the concept of sanctuary. As long as the revolutionaries who are {{fighting}} a guerilla war have a sanctuary, {{in which they can}} <b>hide</b> <b>out,</b> recoup after losses, and store supplies, it is almost impossible for any foreign enemy to ever destroy them. In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Bằng.|$|E
