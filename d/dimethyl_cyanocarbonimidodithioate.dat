40|$|The almost planar (r. m. s. {{deviation}} = 0. 055  Å) title compound, (MeS) C(O) NHC(O) NH 2, {{was formed}} during an attempted crystallization of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>cyanocarbonimidodithioate</b> with CrO 2 Cl 2; an unexpected redox reaction converted the cyanocarbonimido moiety to a urea group and removed one methylthiol group. In the crystal, hydrogen-bonding interactions from the amide and amido N—H groups to carbonyl O atoms of neighbouring molecules result in [010] ribbon-like chains...|$|E
