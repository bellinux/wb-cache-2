30|$|As {{regards the}} {{security}} layers, {{on the one}} hand, Fig.  6 shows that the largest fraction of securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, were issued by <b>General</b> <b>Governments,</b> followed by debt securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (1.13 trillion euros), Rest of the World (1.06 trillion euros), and Other Financial Institutions (1.00 trillion euros). Non-financial Corporations and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds play only a minor role as issuing counterparties of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem. The fact that <b>General</b> <b>Governments</b> {{play a key role}} as an issuing counterparty of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem could be explained as follows. The expectation of the public security purchases by the Eurosystem and the subsequent increase in the prices of the purchased securities may have generated an increase in the purchases of public securities by the private banking sector in order to sell them to the Eurosystem. However, our data, being data on holdings and issuances, are not able to provide empirical evidence of the aforementioned speculation. On the other hand, with particular reference to the APP securities, as we can see from Fig.  7, {{at the end of the}} second quarter of 2017, the largest fraction of APP securities held by the Eurosystem was issued by the institutional sector <b>General</b> <b>Governments,</b> amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, followed by securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (0.31 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.04 trillion euros).

This paper examines {{the stability of}} sub-national governments' indebtedness before gauging the fiscal effort needed to scale back public debt to GSP ratios to ten-year average levels. To do this, we first derive key debt sustainability formulae which are then applied to relevant sub-national data. The analysis reveals that under macroeconomic conditions and fiscal settings in 2012 - 13, debt levels were unstable for all State and Territory <b>general</b> <b>governments.</b> Moreover, virtually all sub-national governments in Australia need to turn existing primary budget deficits into substantial surpluses to restore public debt to levels experienced on average over the previous decade.

30|$|For {{constructing}} the regional (or intraregional) SAM {{at the level}} of prefectures, the economic accounting {{at the level of}} prefecture (or regional SNA) is needed as the main statistics in addition to the regional I–O table of the relevant prefecture.

In addition to the regional I–O table, because regional economic accounting is published in all Japanese prefectures, the basic data source for constructing regional SAMs is available. In particular, we are able to use the following table that is included in prefectural economic accounting: “sectoral income–expenditure transactions of <b>general</b> <b>governments</b> (SIET) table.” Here, the SIET table has rich information on income–expenditure transactions between four institutional sectors: (1) local agencies of central government, (2) prefectural governments, (3) municipal governments, and (4) social security funds, 8 and is certainly needed to construct the detailed interregional SAM proposed in this study.|$|E

The availability and size of such resources and their capabilities is one of the challenges of building and maintaining a smart city.

To top all that there are also the technical challenges requiring highly advanced technological solutions.

40|$|Abstract: Internet voting {{has been}} very topical {{and it has been}} used in {{elections}} in North America, Europe, and elsewhere. The advantages of its use include increased participation from infirmed, elderly, and itinerant voters and quicker vote tabulation. Its disadvantages stem from the inherent lack of control and transparency from allowing votes from homes and other locations rather than from controlled polling stations, which may lead to voter fraud or inadvertent spoilage of "virtual " ballots. Much of this balancing-off of pros and cons is done on a qualitative basis with little attempt at quantifying the risks using an established methodology. The application of a well-known risk analysis method OCTAVE has merely been proposed. In this paper, we extend this general proposal and describe key constructs for applying OCTAVE to perform risk analysis for voting alternatives in <b>general.</b> <b>Governments</b> or other institutions can then use this methodology to perform quantitative risk analysis to compare different voting alternatives including Internet voting, as well as poll, mail-in, and telephone voting...|$|E
40|$|M any economies, {{during the}} early stages of {{monetary}} development,experienced what appear to be sporadic relative shortfalls of smalldenomination means of payment. These episodes have been broadly documented in the literature under the label of “shortages of small change. ” Sargent and Velde (2002), for example, review in great detail the evidence for Europe. Hanson (1979) provides an interesting survey of the evidence for the British colonies in North America. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present evidence of similar events occurring in the early monetary history of Argentina. The provision of small change in modern economies has become almost a nonissue. 1 In fiat money systems, the monetary authority controls the ag-gregate supply of monetary balances (of all denominations) and stands ready to exchange at par any denomination for an equivalent amount of any other denomination. It is, then, demand that determines the relative amounts of the different denominations that circulate in the economy. There are, of course, costs of providing the demanded amounts. Low-denomination coins tend to be relatively more costly to produce (at least, per unit of value). Yet, in <b>general,</b> <b>governments</b> in modern societies have considered these costs worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays on investor differentiation in industrial real estate markets. The first essay examines the following questions: (1) Do corporates buy or sell at different prices when transacting in the industrial market (as assessed from a comparison between the transactions of corporates and non-institutional investors) ? (2) If such a difference does exist, what are the factors that determine its magnitude? Unlike in prior studies on the office market, corporate investors only buy high but do not sell low when transacting in industrial real properties. The pattern of buying high by corporates is consistent during market cycles and across general- and special-purpose property types. The results reflect a higher cost of real capital (acquisition cost) to corporates, and generally imply that the price a corporate {{is willing to pay}} is determined primarily from an overall business value perspective, rather than property market value. In the second essay, I examine the performance of government investors in the industrial market. The analysis reveals that, in <b>general,</b> <b>governments</b> buy high and sell low in comparison to similar property transactions by individuals. On average, governments overpay by an estimated 9. 8 % and sell at a discount of 17. 3 %. The results may help governments identify a potential vulnerable point on their real estate management, and reduce their loss if they can mitigate this inefficiency...|$|E

In particular, we have analyzed balance sheet and macroeconomic data from various sources 18, relative to the nineteen European Union’s Member States belonging to the EMU. Our analysis is based on two categories of variables: i) network variables, i.e., the financial exposures via loan, bond, and equity contracts, through which the euro area sectors are tied to each other; and ii) macroeconomic variables, i.e., i) private and public consumption, ii) private and public investment, iii) Gross Domestic Product (GDP), iv) Harmonised Unemployment Rate (HUR), and v) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The combination of the network variables and macroeconomic variables allows us to shed light on the implications of QE both in terms of stimulation of the real economy and financial stability.
