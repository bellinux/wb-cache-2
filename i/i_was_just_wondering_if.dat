40|$|Intraoperatively, you {{confirmed}} {{entrance and}} exit block of the PVs; however, three months after, when patients got touched up, only 66 % had isolated pul-monary veins. What is your explanation for that? Dr Kurfirst: Yes. I think that during our surgical procedure, {{when you are}} testing the transmurality of the lesion, you are testing it by the decline of im-pedance of the clamps. And also, {{it has been shown}} that clamping of pulmon-ary veins alone, without any energy, has the potential for provoking some kind of exit or entry block for a while, maybe for some hours. So I think that especially in dilated left atria with fibrous tissue, we need more lesions. So these are our results from the beginning of this programme, and I hope that with adding more lesions, we can also increase the success rate of PV isolation. Dr Salzberg: We do a single hybrid approach in Amsterdam, and we clamp the PVs until the impedance drops within 5 seconds, and then we do epicardial entrance and exit block testing.

I could see it had been sarkied. (That's a sort of gum-poison, pater, which attacks the nerve centres. Our chief medical officer is writing a monograph about it.)

40|$|AbstractAt a {{time when}} the {{supremacy}} of SQUIDs as the most sensitive magnetometers is being challenged by the recent progress of optically pumped atomic magnetometers operating at room temperature, looking into new opportunities to further improve SQUIDs sensitivity would probably be most welcomed by the SQUID community. By far the most promising such opportunity is to operate a double (D) rf SQUID (an rf-SQUID in which a dc-SQUID is used instead of a single Josephson junction) in a non-adiabatic regime at frequencies of about a few GHz. At these relatively high frequencies required to assure an ultra-high SQUID sensitivity the SQUID-design complexity and the cost of the electronics involved (current generator and SQUID amplifier) are still kept at reasonable levels. The advantages of using this concept, as presented in my contribution in more detail now, are overwhelming. Ironically, although this idea in its preliminary shape has been around for some time now [1], the opportunity has never <b>been</b> explored experimentally! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what else {{needs to be done to}} get this message across the SQUID community and have this concept finally tested experimentally...|$|R

Many smiling faces and graceful figures glided past me, but the smiles were lavished on other eyes, the figures sustained by other hands than mine. I turned away tantalized, left the dancers, and wandered into the oak-panelled dining-room. No fibre of sympathy united me to any living thing in this house; I looked for and found my mother's picture. I took a wax taper from a stand, and held it up. I gazed long, earnestly; my heart grew to the image. My mother, I perceived, had bequeathed to me much of her features and countenance--her forehead, her eyes, her complexion. No regular beauty pleases egotistical human beings so much as a softened and refined likeness of themselves; for this reason, fathers regard with complacency the lineaments of their daughters' faces, where frequently their own similitude is found flatteringly associated with softness of hue and delicacy of outline. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> how that picture, to me so interesting, would strike an impartial spectator, when a voice close behind me pronounced the words-- ...|$|R

And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.

Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent {{it to me and}} said, 'We want to do this. We will think of it as one thing for now.
