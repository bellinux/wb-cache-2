In 2014 the Constitutional Court {{declared}} section 4 para. 3 of this Law to be unconstitutional in the part where it prohibits couples from accessing heterologous medically assisted procreation techniques if a condition which causes complete, irreversible sterility or infertility has been diagnosed. The <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments</b> in science and law, and the deep implications that the application of new techniques − which involve {{in the context of}} procreation a third person − can have in terms of protection of health and not only, makes it appropriate to keep under review this area, taking into account the pronouncements of the European Court of Human Rights and regulations in European countries...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{science has}} led to {{exciting}} new developments, but {{the nature of the}} work has exposed limitations in our ability to evaluate published findings. Reproducibility has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible. The rise of computational science {{has led to}}exciting and <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments</b> inmany scientific areas. New technologies, increased computing power, and methodological advances have dramatically improved our ability to collect complex high-dimensional data (1, 2). Large data sets have led to scientists doing more computation, as well as researchers in computa-tionally oriented fields directly engaging in more science. The availability of large public databases has allowed for researchers to make meaningful scientific contributions without using the tradi-tional tools of a given field. As an example o...|$|E
40|$|Entry {{into force}} of the UN Watercourses Convention in August 2014, {{and the opening of}} the UNECE Water Convention to all states in March 2016, are {{significant}} milestones in international water law. A comparative analysis of these two global water conven- tions and the 1995 Mekong Agreement shows that all three instruments are generally compatible. Nonetheless, the international legal principles and processes set forth in the two conventions can render the Mekong Agreement more up to date, robust and practical. Strengthening the Agreement would be timely, given the increasing pres- sures associated with the rapid hydropower development within the basin and the gradually emerging disputes therein. Because of these <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments,</b> the monograph strongly recommends that the Mekong states seriously consider joining both conventions in order to buttress and clarify key provisions of the 1995 Mekong Agreement...|$|E

"In {{view of the}} <b>fast-moving</b> {{dangerous}} <b>developments</b> in the Islamic world, it is very distressing to see the {{tendencies of}} permitting or underestimating the shedding of blood of Muslims and those under protection in their countries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} challenging issues in current learning technology research, particularly {{in relation to}} emerging collaborative technologies and the {{growing body of evidence}} on the learner experience. The complex nature of the interplay of social, technical and environmental factors is examined along with an overview of the key theoretical models which are currently in play. Limitations are identified in the learning technology literature in which a technological determinism is often evident, despite repeated calls for an approach which takes fuller account of the technology's pedagogical, organisational, social and technical aspects. We propose that interdisciplinary collaboration has the potential to help us address the demanding task of analysing these interconnected factors, and may also go some way towards mitigating over-charged claims of the impact and effectiveness of learning technology against the reality of its use. The focus of this paper is on sociotechnical approaches, particularly those derived from a social informatics tradition, which to date appear to have received little attention in learning technology research. We identify potential benefits in applying these approaches to today's learning environment which encompasses <b>fast-moving</b> technology <b>developments</b> along with changing communicative behaviours among learners, whether on campus, in the workplace or in everyday life. Most importantly, sociotechnical frameworks address the issue of technological determinism by explicitly recognising that agency also resides in individual learners, social structures, the design of learning artefacts and context in which the learning takes place. In order to demonstrate the value of such approaches, we go on to outline findings from the application of one of these concepts, namely a sociotechnical interaction network (STIN), to a transnational networked learning context. The paper concludes by proposing that these approaches in general, and the sociotechnical interaction network concept in particular, are important conceptual tools in dealing with issues currently confronting contemporary learning technology research, such as the spread of web 2. 0 and mobile technologies and the increasingly complex social and technological contexts of many learners. They may also provide a valuable means of exploring the increasingly blurred distinction between abstract and formal learning, and situated informal learning, particularly in relation to the workplace...|$|R
40|$|In the United State’s {{response}} {{to the events of}} the Arab Spring, the Obama administration has been consistently careful not to get ahead of <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments.</b> Critics have decried the administration’s apparent lack of a coherent approach, and its willingness to talk the language of democratic ideals whilst acting to protect national interests. Supporters, on the other hand, have praised the blending of pragmatism and principle as evidence of a smarter approach to international affairs than that of Obama’s predecessor. The United States’ cautious and contradictory approach, which has at times amounted to the endorsement of the inevitable, reflects wider strategic tensions in the United States’ approach to the Middle East, and the reality that whilst the US {{may be the most important}} external power in the region, its ability to dictate outcomes is limited. Yet by ‘muddling through’ and insisting on keeping the United States on the right side of history throughout the course of the Arab revolutions, the Obama administration has ensured that the new regimes in the region will have to continue to work with the United States, and ensured that the US is not diverted from its overriding strategic reorientation towards the Asia-Pacific...|$|E
40|$|Cities of Light is {{the first}} global {{overview}} of modern urban illumination, a development that allows human wakefulness to colonize the night, doubling the hours available for purposeful and industrious activities. Urban lighting is undergoing a revolution due to recent developments in lighting technology, and increased focus on sustainability and human-scaled environments. Cities of Light is expansive in coverage, spanning two centuries and touching on developments on six continents, without diluting its central focus on architectural and urban lighting. Covering history, geography, theory, and speculation in urban lighting, readers will have numerous points of entry into the book, finding it easy to navigate for a quick reference and or a coherent narrative if read straight through. With chapters written by respected scholars and highly-regarded contemporary practitioners, this book will delight students and practitioners of architectural and urban history, area and cultural studies, and lighting design professionals and the institutional and municipal authorities they serve. At {{a moment when the}} entire world is being reshaped by new lighting technologies and new design attitudes, the longer history of urban lighting remains fragmentary. Cities of Light aims to provide a global framework for historical studies of urban lighting and to offer a new perspective on the <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments</b> of lighting today...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{have led}} to exciting <b>fast-moving</b> <b>developments</b> in science. Today, {{we are living in}} a technology-driven era of biological discovery. Consequently, tracking technologies have facilitated dramatic advances in the fundamental understanding of ecology and animal behaviour. Major technological improvements, such as the development of GPS dataloggers, geolocators and other bio-logging technologies, provide a volume of data that were hitherto unconceivable. Hence we can claim that ornithology has entered the era of big data. In this paper, which is particularly addressed to undergraduate students and starting researchers in the emerging field of movement ecology, I summarise {{the current state of the}} art of individual-based tracking methods for birds as well as the most important challenges that, as a personal user, I consider we should address in future. To this end, I first provide a brief overview of individual tracking systems for birds. I then discuss current challenges for tracking birds with remote telemetry, including technological challenges (i. e., tag miniaturisation, incorporation of more bio-logging sensors, better efficiency in data archiving and data processing), as well as scientific challenges (i. e., development of new computational tools, investigation of spatial and temporal autocorrelation of data, improvement in environmental data annotation processes, the need for novel behavioural segmentation algorithms, the change from two to three, and even four, dimensions in the scale of analysis, and the inclusion of animal interactions). I also highlight future prospects of this research field including a set of scientific questions that have been answered by means of telemetry technologies or are expected to be answered in the future. Finally, I discuss some ethical aspects of bird tracking, putting special emphases on getting the most out of data and enhancing a culture of multidisciplinary collaboration among research groups...|$|E
