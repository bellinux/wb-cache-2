The +Teamgeist ball differs from previous balls in having just 14 curved panels (making the ball topologically equivalent to a truncated octahedron), rather than the 32 that have been standard since 1970. Like the 32 panel Roteiro which preceded it, the +TeamGeist panels are bonded together, rather than stitched. It is claimed to be rounder and to perform more uniformly regardless of where it is hit, and being almost waterproof, it does not get heavier in wet weather.|$|E

40|$|In {{the open}} {{innovation}} management literature, {{it is widely}} acknowledged that individuals {{play a crucial role}} in collaborative knowledge creation processes. However, the literature tends not to explore the human side of open <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> The present article therefore examines the competencies that professionals need for working in open <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> (specific but not necessarily unique to open innovation) and to cope with the challenges they face. A qualitative study consisting of explorative interviews and focus group discussions was conducted, resulting in a competence profile for open innovation professionals. The profile adds a new perspective to the field of open innovation management by focusing on how individuals involved in open <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> can enhance open innovation success. It reveals, among other things, how professionals can generate new knowledge, build trust, and deal with low reciprocal commitment in open <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Especially, brokering solutions and being socially competent seem to be important for open innovation professionals.

Design/methodology/approach-The members of <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> may develop friendly and friendship relationships over time. In our study, we focus on the effect of the frequency of such non-work relationships on team performance. For this research, we collected full network data on non-work relationships in a sample of 44 <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> and investigate how these "friendly and friendship networks" affect the performance of <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Findings-As result turns out that the frequency of friendly ties has positive as well as negative consequences on team performance, whereas the frequency of friendship ties positively relates to the performance. Research limitations/implications-The results indicate the importance of informal relations for the performance of <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Further, it is shown that friendly and friendship relations have different theoretical and practical implications. Future research can overcome the limitations of the presented research by concentrating on larger sample sizes and longitudinal research designs. Practical implications-Building on {{the results of the study}} managers can better orchestra <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> focussing not only on formal but also on informal contacts. The main practical implication is to strive for friendship contacts and to avoid too strong friendly contacts. Originality/value-The study adds knowledge to the research on informal relationships and performance two-fold. First, the findings testify that friendly and friendship contacts are different and not part of the same dimension, and there is strong evidence for the importance of informal contacts...|$|R

40|$|Is there a {{role for}} the {{multifaceted}} Renaissance Man in modern team-intensive innovation activities? This paper argues that researchers with broad knowledge, also known as generalists, make an especially valuable contribution to <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Given the re-combinative nature of technological progress, innovation results depend crucially on the skilful matching of different pieces of knowledge. The presence of generalists in <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> makes the knowledge recombination process more effective, even if this comes {{at the cost of}} reduced knowledge depth. Moreover, typical barriers in team processes become less acute with the presence of generalists. We analyze the role of generalists versus specialists in <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> by tracking the trajectories of inventors in the electrical and electronics industry through their patenting activity. Our findings suggest that <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> with the contribution of generalists outperform those that rely on a diverse set of specialistsFinancial support under Grants ECO 2009 - 08278 and ECO 2009 - 08308 of the Spanish Government is gratefully acknowledge...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} Communication and Performance explores how communicational {{structures}} impact {{the performance of}} <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Communication is particular important in teams in which members with different specializations and professional backgrounds have to execute the work together as it is common in <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> This book argues that communicational structures influence the performance of <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> through three mediating factors, individual creativity, individual commitment and team discensus. It is shown that team discensus, or the conflict potential in teams, relates positively to team performance {{in the beginning of}} an innovation process, however negatively in the end of an innovation process. Individual creativity and individual commitment always foster the performance of <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Moreover, the study indicates that communicational structures indeed impact team performance via individual creativity, individual commitment and team discensus and that in order to improve the performance of teams a managerial focus on the team as a entity is more promising than focusing on single individuals in the team. Further, three managerial tools are introduced and explored that are useful for managing the structures of communication. These managerial tools are computer-mediated means of communication, physical proximity of the team members, and team composition. Altogether, this PhD thesis provides a tool and managerial knowledge for analyzing and navigating the structures of communication toward a better performance. ...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{strategic}} {{emphasis on}} new product development {{is reflected in}} the exploration and exploitation of value relevant for sustainable competitive advantage. However, traditional management approaches have been inadequate in meeting this strategic imperative taking into consideration the high rate of failure in the creation and capture of sustainable value from new product innovations. Scenario thinking by virtue of its ability to help improve foresight, learning and the probing of the unknown future may serve as a strategic management approach that could help product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> to explore and exploit the much needed value from their innovations. Scenario thinking in this thesis refers to the use of scenario narratives to stimulate actions in the immediate present (also informed by the past) about the possible future aimed at improving understanding of the cost, returns, efficiency and all the requisite information related to the creation and capture of value from new product innovation. From a transdisciplinary perspective this research takes on the phenomenological treatment of practices as advanced by the contemporary turn to ‘practice’ to explore scenario thinking in product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> It adopts a case based approach with three software organisations and four of their new product development projects serving as the empirical research sites. With emphasis on the meso-level, the product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> represent the sociological level of inquiry with emphasis placed on their everyday practices and their relationships in context. Data for the empirical inquiry were chiefly collected using the qualitative methods of ethnographic interviews, non-participant observation and the analysis of organisational and project archival documents. The thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in three main areas. Firstly, it unpacks scenario thinking, in the form of strategizing and foresighting and how it manifest in the actions of the present by showing that traditional scenario exercises are only a momentary part of the practice of scenario thinking by developing a socially embedded process base model to show how the practice, with no specific conformity, comes to presence in product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> Secondly, as an empirical process study it shows how and when the practice of scenario thinking in product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> may lead to the identification of opportunities for innovation. Thirdly, it shows why some organisations are more ‘foresightful’ than others VI by identifying those practices and their underlying activities that enable (or impede) the cultivation of scenario thinking in product <b>innovation</b> <b>teams.</b> In relation to practice it is argued that scenario thinking should not be seen as a ‘one-off’ episodic intervention but rather an everyday practice intentionally or non-intentionally engaged in by organisational actors in their situated practice. As an internally and contextually generated competence imbued with routines, values and know-how it is difficult for competitors to imitate and the practice does not necessarily require an external management guru to facilitate. Effective management of those practices identified to enable (or impede) scenario thinking in <b>innovation</b> <b>teams</b> could lead to the identification of novel opportunities for innovation...|$|R

The relationships between team reflexivity, a demanding work environment (i. e. quality of the physical work environment and work load) and <b>team</b> <b>innovation</b> was examined among 98 primary health care teams (PHCTs) in the UK, comprised of 1137 individuals.
