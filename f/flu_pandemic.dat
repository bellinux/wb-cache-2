5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic,</b> which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Brinkley {{opened a}} 16-room clinic in Milford, where he won over the locals {{immediately}} by paying good wages, invigorating {{the local economy}} and making house calls on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic.</b> For all his later infamy as a charlatan, accounts of his success at nursing flu victims back to health, and the lengths to which he went to treat them, were resoundingly positive.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, investigative work in 1999 by a British {{team led}} by {{virologist}} John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital identified the major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples, France, as being {{the center of the}} 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic.</b> These researchers postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated so it could migrate to pigs that were kept near the front.|$|E
40|$|I {{have chosen}} {{the subject of this}} work because I am very {{interested}} in the flu issue.

50|$|Later <b>flu</b> <b>pandemics</b> {{were not}} so devastating. They {{included}} the 1957 Asian Flu (type A, H2N2 strain) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (type A, H3N2 strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In later pandemics antibiotics were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Hong Kong's {{transfer}} to China, the territory has suffered coincidentally an economic double-blow: Asian Financial Crisis and the H5N1 avian <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic.</b> The then-Financial Secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, adopted a radical measure {{to make use}} of British Hong Kong foreign currency reserves and restored Hong Kong's financial stability. In December 1997, officials had to destroy 1.4 million livestock in order to contain the H5 virus from spreading.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone house}} {{remained}} the Ricketts family's summer home. After the hotel closed, several small cabins were {{built around the}} lake for rental to sportsmen. Ricketts proposed moving the highway from his front yard in 1904; the Pennsylvania General Assembly approved this in 1908, after he paid {{for the construction of}} the new highway. The house was renovated and added to in 1913, and Ricketts died there during the 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic.</b> His wife died shortly thereafter, and they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near {{the north end of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic,</b> known as the Russian flu.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] This {{fact sheet}} tells {{how to set}} up an {{infection}} control program that will make workplaces safer during a <b>pandemic</b> <b>flu.</b> A <b>pandemic</b> <b>flu</b> will have a huge impact on workers in the United States. During the worst part of a <b>pandemic</b> <b>flu,</b> 40 % to 60 % of workers may have to stay home. Some workers are more likely to get sick, like health care workers and those who respond to an emergency. Workers who have a lot of close contact with the public are also in danger. Whenever workers are at risk of getting the virus, employers must take steps to prevent it from spreading. This is called infection control...|$|R

5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she had died in the 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic,</b> that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic,</b> and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic</b> during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E

After the war, Sawyer's grandfather became {{the owner of the}} Chalfonte Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey. Sawyer's father, Henry Sawyer II, died in the 1918 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic</b> two months before his son was born, and Sawyer was raised by his mother, a school teacher, in Philadelphia's Germantown neighborhood.

After graduation, Sawyer enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) where he wrote for The Daily Pennsylvanian, joined the Zeta Psi fraternity, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic</b> vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Canadiens {{ice hockey}} club, {{formally}} , {{was founded on}} December 4, 1909. The Canadiens are the oldest professional hockey franchise in the world. Created as {{a founding member of}} the National Hockey Association (NHA) with the aim of appealing to Montreal's francophone population, the Canadiens played their first game on January 5, 1910, and captured their first Stanley Cup in 1916. The team left the NHA and helped found the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917. They returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 1919, but their series against the Seattle Metropolitans was canceled without a winner due to the Spanish <b>flu</b> <b>pandemic</b> that killed defenceman Joe Hall. The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times: once while part of the National Hockey Association (NHA), and 23 times as members of the NHL.
