500|$|... was an {{impulsive}} young man. From rare {{photographs and}} {{the testimony of}} his contemporaries emerges [...] a figure of medium stature, with slightly drooped shoulders, thick brown hair, and a pale oval face. His eyebrows were dark, {{and one of them}} was almost always raised, giving his face an expression of intense irony. His eyes burned with constant passion, and <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in his smile. He smiled often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to Rinder, executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably and <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> so completely blue that he was incapable of talking". (The executive in question denied to the Tampa Bay Times that this incident had ever happened).|$|E
2500|$|After Moore was {{released}} {{again from the}} University of Virginia Health System, he traveled {{to his home in}} Los Angeles, to start his rehabilitation program. On the morning of August 19, Moore was feeling unwell and those present could see that <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> turning blue. [...] He was rushed to the hospital, but died shortly thereafter. While it was widely reported that he had died from a blood clot, the coroner's office determined his cause of death to be pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> curled, and <b>his</b> leg was fried.|$|R
60|$|The smile {{which for}} a moment dwelt on <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> not unkind.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{looked up}} quickly. His face was very white, and <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> quivering.|$|R
2500|$|The admiration between Revelli and Schembechler was mutual. [...] In a 1970 interview, Revelli {{compared}} {{himself and}} his training methods to those of Schembechler. [...] "Bo and I speak the same language. [...] Psychologically, our practices are the same. [...] Both the team and the band have to perfect their fundamentals before they can do anything else. [...] And both need proper warmups {{to stay in shape}} in the off-season. [...] Sometimes we'll spend 45 minutes on calisthenics of the embouchure (perfecting the position of the lips on the mouthpiece of an instrument). [...] I had one boy come back who hadn't practiced all summer. [...] <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> about six months behind everyone else's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches on <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> given to him because he cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E
60|$|The bristly red {{moustache}} was contorted {{as though}} <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> smiling.|$|E

60|$|Streuss {{was surely}} {{something}} of a charlatan! His revolver had disappeared. The smile upon <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> both gracious and unembarrassed.|$|R
60|$|First Inquisitor. [aside] <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> quivering. The flame that shone {{within his}} eyes but now Has flickered and gone out.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> dry, and {{he could}} not moisten. them with his tongue.|$|E
60|$|She still sobbed, {{ignoring}} him, ignoring {{that he held}} her. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> dry.|$|E
60|$|Duane {{tried to}} speak. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> weak, {{and he could}} {{scarcely}} move them.|$|E
60|$|The voices {{around him}} {{were still a}} little tangled, but the hand which held a {{steaming}} tumbler to <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> Philippa's.|$|R
60|$|The merchants {{brought him}} {{steatite}} from Sidon in their painted ships: The meanest cup that touched <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> fashioned from a chrysolite.|$|R
60|$|Sir Timothy seemed {{suddenly}} {{very much}} younger. The droop of <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> no longer pathetic. There {{was a little}} humourous twitch there.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> {{twisted in}} an {{unpleasant}} {{smile as he}} frowned down upon the tablecloth.|$|E
60|$|The yellow face of {{the steward}} was greenish with terror, and <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> dry.|$|E
60|$|He gave {{no sign of}} {{annoyance}} but <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> firmly closed. She watched him steadfastly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Aurora!' {{he cried}} again, {{and with that}} enigmatic word on <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> incinerated in the vast and towering belch of the devouring element.|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} fixed again, and the only word that came from <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> the word {{millions}} of times repeated. Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very much}} obliged to you,' {{answered}} Guy, his voice stern and dignified, and the smile that curled <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> like Philip's own.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> a contused, shapeless mass, and {{his mouth}} was full of blood and broken teeth.|$|E
60|$|Silas Zane {{came running}} into the room. His face was ghastly, even <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> white and drawn.|$|E
60|$|Stanley moved {{a little}} on his feet. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> {{slightly}} parted, his eyes fixed upon Mr. Bundercombe.|$|E
60|$|He smiled very slightly, yet {{it seemed}} to me that the curve of <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> almost a caress. There was {{certainly}} nothing left now of Mr. Grooten.|$|R
60|$|Joe's {{knuckles}} were torn, {{his nose}} <b>was</b> bleeding, <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>was</b> cut and swollen, while his shirt {{had been ripped}} down from throat to waist. Further, he was tired, and breathing hard.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc, {{turning her}} head slowly, {{transferred}} her stare {{from the wall}} to her husbandâ€™s person. Mr Verloc, with {{the tips of his}} fingers between <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> <b>was</b> looking on the ground.|$|R
60|$|Ezra {{glanced at}} his father, and saw that <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> moving tremulously as they pattered forth prayers.|$|E

60|$|Mr. de Valentin bowed slightly, {{and turned}} away. <b>His</b> <b>lips</b> <b>were</b> parted {{in a very}} {{unpleasant}} and most peculiar smile.|$|E
60|$|Going back to {{his room}} he took out his {{revolver}} and loaded every chamber. In the set of <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> menace to the next employer who dared to insult and degrade him.|$|R
60|$|His fading {{voice trailed}} away into silence. A cough shook him, and the faint crimson foam on <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> increased. But he rallied again, and lay there panting, his fingers {{plucking}} at the coverlet.|$|R
60|$|On <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>was</b> the soothing, {{purring sound}} {{that the great}} cats {{themselves}} made when contented and happy. It was the nearest approach to a friendly advance that Tarzan could make {{in the language of}} Sheeta.|$|R
