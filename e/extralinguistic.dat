The term heteroglossia refers to the qualities of a language that are <b>extralinguistic,</b> but common to all languages.

In this way most languages are incapable of neutrality, for every word is inextricably bound to the context in which it exists.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{studies on}} iconicity in ASL were {{published}} in the late 1970s, and early 1980s. [...] Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of the language. Though they recognized that certain aspects of the language seemed iconic, they considered this to be merely <b>extralinguistic,</b> a property which did not influence the language. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties. Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically {{to the rest of the}} sign language community. Frishberg (1975) wrote a very influential paper addressing the relationship between arbitrariness and iconicity in ASL. She concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of grammatical processes. In other words, over time, the natural processes of regularization in the language obscures any iconically motivated features of the sign.|$|E

For example, you cannot infer sarcasm purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists think that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and <b>extralinguistic</b> context, which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on.

50|$|A {{more common}} term for this {{phenomenon}} is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues {{that there has been}} a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for. This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (<b>extralinguistic)</b> factors underlying their different competencies.|$|E
50|$|When {{children}} {{are presented with}} a sentence that includes an unfamiliar verb, {{they need to make}} the correct associations between a new word and what it refers to. They might look to <b>extralinguistic</b> context clues to help them determine what the meaning of that verb is, but the environment does not give specific enough evidence to determine that meaning. While some researchers thought that cross-situational learning could help children to learn words, Gillette et al. (1999) have shown that this kind of learning procedure is especially difficult for verbs. Rather, they proposed that children use syntactic information, such as the position of words within sentences, to help them learn word meanings.|$|E
50|$|Syntactic {{bootstrapping}} is {{a theory}} in linguistics which proposes that children learn word meanings by recognizing the syntactic categories (such as nouns, adjectives, etc.) and structure of their language. Children have innate knowledge of the links between syntactic and semantic categories and can use their observations about syntax to make inferences about word meaning. Learning words in one's native language can be challenging because the <b>extralinguistic</b> context of use does not give specific enough information about word meanings. This problem can be overcome by using information present in a word's syntactic category. Once conclusions are made about a word's syntactic category, a child can then infer aspects of the word's meaning.|$|E

5000|$|The {{semantic}} bootstrapping hypothesis {{has been}} criticized by some linguists. An alternative hypothesis to semantic bootstrapping, syntactic bootstrapping, proposes that verbs are always learned based on their syntactic properties rather than their semantic properties. This is sometimes construed as being incompatible with semantic bootstrapping, which proposes that verb meanings can be identified from the <b>extralinguistic</b> context of use. Pinker does not see syntactic bootstrapping as an alternative or necessarily bootstrapping at all. Pinker makes the critical distinction that semantic bootstrapping seeks to answer how children can learn syntax and grammar while the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is only concerned with how children learn verb meanings. Pinker believes that syntactic bootstrapping is more accurately [...] "syntactic cueing of word meaning" [...] and that this use of syntactic knowledge to obtain new semantic knowledge {{is in no way}} contradictory to semantic bootstrapping, but is another technique a child may use in later stages of language acquisition.|$|E
50|$|Frege {{developed}} his original theory {{of meaning in}} early works like Begriffsschrift (concept script) of 1879 and Grundlagen (foundations of arithmetic) of 1884. On this theory, {{the meaning of a}} complete sentence consists in its being true or false, and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an <b>extralinguistic</b> entity which Frege called its Bedeutung, literally meaning or significance, but rendered by Freges translators as reference, referent, Meaning, nominatum etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function, but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself. Thus Caesar conquered Gaul divides into the complete term Caesar, whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term —conquered Gaul, whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence - its truth value - appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.|$|E
50|$|When {{reading a}} sentence, readers will analyze {{the words and}} phrases they see and make inferences about the sentence’s {{grammatical}} structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse the sentence chunks {{at a time and}} will try to interpret the meaning of the sentence at each interval. As readers are given more information they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of the whole sentence. With each new portion of the sentence encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with the sentence structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption {{about the rest of the}} sentence. The garden path sentence effect occurs when the sentence has a phrase or word with an ambiguous meaning that the reader interprets in a certain way, and when they read the whole sentence there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate the sentence again to understand its meaning. The sentence may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the <b>extralinguistic</b> context.|$|E
5000|$|In {{linguistic}} pragmatics, exophora is {{reference to}} something <b>extralinguistic,</b> i.e. {{not in the}} same text, and contrasts with endophora. Exophora can be deictic, in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something {{in the context of the}} utterance or speaker. For example, pronouns are often exophoric, with words such as [...] "this", [...] "that", [...] "here", [...] "there", as in that chair over there is John's said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to. Given [...] "Did the gardener water those plants?", it is quite possible that [...] "those" [...] refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion. But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place [...] - [...] to the [...] "context of situation", as it is called [...] - [...] where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary. The interpretation would be [...] "those plants there, in front of us". This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether. Exophoric reference is not cohesive, since it does not bind the two elements together into a text.|$|E
5000|$|The term “deixis” {{refers to}} the ways in which {{language}} encodes contextual information into its grammatical system. More broadly, deixis {{refers to the}} inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs.  To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the “here” and “now” (proximal deixis) from the “then” and “there” (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, “When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on <b>extralinguistic,</b> subjective, occasion-specific considerations.” Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story’s characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. “Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation”. [...] Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the social}} {{sciences}} now distinguish between biologically defined sex and socially constructed gender, the term gender is now also sometimes used by linguists to refer to social gender as well as grammatical gender. Traditionally, however, a distinction has been made by linguists between sex and gender, where sex refers primarily to the attributes of real-world entities - the relevant <b>extralinguistic</b> attributes being, for instance, male, female, non-personal, and indeterminate sex - and grammatical gender refers to a category, such as masculine, feminine, and neuter (often based on sex, but not exclusively so in all languages), that determines the agreement between nouns of different genders and associated words, such as articles and adjectives.A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language, for instance, states [...] By GENDER is meant a grammatical classification of nouns, pronouns, or other words in the noun phrase according to certain meaning-related distinctions, especially a distinction related to {{the sex of the}} referent. [...] Thus German, for instance, has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Nouns referring to people and animals of known sex are generally referred to by nouns with the equivalent gender. Thus Mann (meaning man) is masculine and is associated with a masculine definite article to give der Mann, while Frau (meaning woman) is feminine and is associated with a feminine definite article to give die Frau. However the words for inanimate objects are commonly masculine (e.g. der Tisch, the table) or feminine (die Armbanduhr, the watch), and grammatical gender can diverge from biological sex; for instance the feminine noun die Person refers to a person of either sex, and the neuter noun das Mädchen means [...] "the girl".|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study is the {{validation}} of a series of predictions concerning the ability to comprehend different pragmatic phenomena expressed through linguistic or gestural means. According to the Cognitive Pragmatics Theory, it exists a gradation of difficulty in the comprehension of different pragmatic phenomena, depending upon the complexity of the mental representations involved; furthermore, the construction of the meaning of a communicative act is relatively independent by the input modality. Thus, we predict that the same gradient of difficulty in the comprehension of different pragmatic phenomena should be detected in both the linguistic and the <b>extralinguistic</b> communication. As right hemisphere injured patients are well known for having pragmatic deficit, also when tested through <b>extralinguistic</b> communication, we aim at comparing their performance on linguistic versus <b>extralinguistic</b> pragmatic ability.

Furthermore, our results showed an overlap in brain regions involved in unification of speaker-related information and those used for the unification of semantic and world knowledge information [inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA 45 / 47) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) ].

Following the tenets of Cognitive Pragmatics theory, which provides a framework for explaining differences in difficulty as regards various pragmatic phenomena, we investigate the ability to comprehend direct, indirect, deceitful, and ironic communication acts performed through linguistic and <b>extralinguistic</b> means. Our main prediction {{is that there is a}} gradation of difficulty in comprehending these communicative phenomena, in deaf children as well as in hearing children. This prediction is grounded on the assumptions that the construction of the meaning of a communication act is independent of both the communicative means (i. e. linguistic or <b>extralinguistic)</b> and the input modalities (i. e. oral or visual). Rather (as supported by previous studies on hearing children), the gradation of difficulty is determined by mental representations of different complexity and inferential chains of different loads.

However, no study has analyzed this phenomenon according to <b>extralinguistic</b> factors, nor determined which linguistic factors are the most significant predictors of this variation when considered together. The current study presents a variationist analysis of the choice of infinitive versus subjunctive after para.

Six linguistic variables related to the para and/or matrix clause are also included (type and person of the para clause subject, coreferentiality between para and matrix clause subjects, transitivity of the para clause verb, and discourse theme and informational status of the para clause).

40|$|Crosslinguistic {{variation}} in vocabulary composition is usually attributed {{to differences in}} the structural properties of languages and correlated differences in the frequency and salience of different word classes in the input. Here we explore whether another property of the input, the <b>extralinguistic</b> contexts of word use, can account for {{the similarities and differences}} in the early vocabularies of English and Mandarin learners. Early word learning is limited by the child’s initial representation of the input. Since novice language learners know few words and little syntax, they must initially learn words from the <b>extralinguistic</b> contexts in which they appear. By simulating this learning procedure with adults we can determine whether the information in word-to-world pairs is sufficient to account for the composition of early vocabularies in both linguistic environments. We assessed the potency of word-to-world mapping in each language by asking adult native-speakers to identify nouns and verbs from their <b>extralinguistic</b> contexts in maternal speech. We found that verbs were identified more often in Mandarin (p <. 001) while nouns were identified more often in English (p <. 001). Even after the data were corrected to compensate for potential differences in response bias, there was still a large and persistent difference in verb identification. Subjects in both groups performed well on action verbs and poorly on verbs referring to unobservable relations or mental states. Since Mandarin mothers used more action verbs than the Americans, the Mandarin subjects were better able to identify their target verbs. These results indicate that the information available in <b>extralinguistic</b> contexts can account both for the early acquisition of verbs in Mandarin and for the predominantly nominal initial vocabulary of English learners. Cognitively mature adults, forced to rely on the evidence of their senses, were able to identify only those words that can be learned by children who are similarly impaired...|$|E

If {{this is due to}} an attempt to conserve the French language, there should also be similar concern with foreign cultural references. This essay uses qualitative analyses of <b>extralinguistic</b> references to discover if a so-called domesticating practice is notable also in French subtitling. Sweden, however, is a smaller country, and may be considered more Americanized culturally. Swedish subtitling is used as the more globalized counterpart. This research cites instances in which <b>extralinguistic</b> references are made and how they are subsequently dealt with in the translated subtitles. The instances are singled out and then individually analyzed. Using four categories of translation methods for <b>Extralinguistic</b> Cultural References (ECRs), this study investigates whether translation norms differ between Swedish and French subtitles. This study‘s most important finding is that there do seem to be different norms for Swedish and French subtitles and that the francophone target audience is not required to move so far from its domestic reference frame as is the Swedish target audience. Another important finding is that while there are both quantitative and qualitative differences, there are also striking similarities on the statistical level, indicating that there are global norms that govern translation in general, and specifically subtitling.
