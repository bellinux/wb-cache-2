While passing through Zanesville the route passes woodland, with some commercial businesses. The highway makes a sharp curve due west, before another sharp curve northeast. After the second curve the route leaves Zanesville, running parallel to the Muskingum River and an Ohio Central Railroad track. The road makes a sharp curve northwest and passes under the Ohio Central Railroad track. After passing under the railroad track the route curves north-northeast and the railroad track curves due east. The roadway passes through the Zanesville State <b>Forest</b> <b>Nursery,</b> followed by a curve northwest, passing through the state <b>forest</b> <b>nursery</b> again. After leaving the state <b>forest</b> <b>nursery,</b> the highway passes through farmland heading due north. The route curves northeast passing through the state <b>forest</b> <b>nursery</b> {{for the last time}} and the highway has an intersection with County Road 40 (CR40), in rural Jefferson Township. Following this intersection, SR666 turns due west, before curving towards the north. This section of roadway passes mostly through farmland, with wooded areas when the route is close to the river. SR666 ends at an intersection with SR208 near Dresden, on the east bank of the Muskingum River.|$|E

25|$|The general {{short-term}} {{effect of}} nitrogen fertilization on coniferous seedlings is to stimulate shoot growth {{more so than}} root growth (Armson and Carman 1961). Over a longer period, root growth is also stimulated. Many nursery managers were long reluctant to apply nitrogenous fertilizers late in the growing season, for fear of increased danger of frost damage to succulent tissues. A presentation at the North American Forest Tree Nursery Soils Workshop at Syracuse in 1980 provided strong contrary evidence: Bob Eastman, President of the Western Maine <b>Forest</b> <b>Nursery</b> Co. stated that for 15 years he {{has been successful in}} avoiding winter “burn” to Norway spruce and white spruce in his nursery operation by fertilizing with 50-80lb/ac (56–90kg/ha) nitrogen in September, whereas previously winter burn had been experienced annually, often severely. Eastman also stated that the overwintering storage capacity of stock thus treated was much improved (Eastman 1980).|$|E

40|$|Colletotrichum {{isolates}} {{obtained from}} tropical <b>forest</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Surveys of <b>forest</b> <b>nurseries</b> in Malaysia {{have shown that}} Colletotrichum {{is one of the}} major fungi associated with seedling diseases. Morphological and cultural characteristics of 12 Colletotrichum isolates from several <b>forest</b> <b>nurseries</b> in Peninsular Malaysia and an isolate from Guatemala were compared. Results from the preliminary morphological studies suggest that most of the isolates produced ovoid/straight conidia with rounded apices typical of C. gloeosporioides. The exception was isolate 689 (ex Gliricidia sepium, from Guatemala) which produced ovoid conidia with pointed apices. Morphological analysis of the other isolates illustrated that most of them showed variation in their conidial size, appressorial shape and size, suggesting the existence of different forms of C. gloeosporioides. The results also revealed distinct appressorial shapes. Some produced globose appressoria, whilst in others appressoria were lobed. These features were reliable and reproducible characteristics. All isolates became septate on germination, suggesting that none of them are members of the C. orbiculare group. Other criteria such as culture characteristics, the presence and dimensions of setae...|$|R

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>nurseries</b> in Sweden produce ca. 360 million {{seedlings}} of Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. annually. Fungi {{represent the}} largest microbial component in rhizospheres and may significantly affect health and, consequently, {{quality of the}} seedlings. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess fungi focusing on pathogens in roots and the sphagnum peat growth substrate of healthy-looking P. sylvestris and P. abies seedlings from nine <b>forest</b> <b>nurseries</b> situated in northern, central and southern regions of Sweden. We hypothesized that nursery stock and the growth substrate can provide a venue for dissemination of fungal diseases. In each nursery and for each tree species, 100 seedlings with the growth substrate were collected during the dormant period. DNA was isolated from parts of root systems and from samples of the growth substrate, amplified using internal transcribed spacer of rDNA as a marker and 454 -sequenced. Clustering at 98. 5 % similarity of 169, 844 high-quality sequences resulted in 619 non-singleton fungal taxa. Although results showed that management practices in <b>forest</b> <b>nurseries</b> generally give a healthy stock, latent establishment of pathogenic fungi in both roots and the growth substrate supported the hypothesis. Furthermore, seedling roots and the growth substrate were inhabited by distinct communities of fungi, and lifestyles of these fungi largely determined community segregation into particular ecological niche...|$|R
