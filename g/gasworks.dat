5|$|A small <b>gasworks</b> a short {{distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the <b>gasworks,</b> running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the <b>gasworks</b> closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
5|$|Early {{industries}} in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in Forbury, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham <b>Gasworks,</b> which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the <b>gasworks</b> were a local landmark, and were not removed until {{the construction of the}} Caversham bypass in the 1970s and 1980s. Other noted {{industries in}} early Caversham included breweries, a tannery, and a match factory.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{a public}} company was formed to provide an {{electricity}} supply for Cullompton which merged with the Bradninch Electricity Company in 1927 to form the Culm Valley Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. A <b>gasworks</b> {{was set up in}} Cullompton in 1865 for the Cullompton Gas Light and Coke Co. This was taken over by the Devon Gas Association and nationalised in 1949. The <b>gasworks</b> was closed in 1956 and Cullompton was then supplied from Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by {{the work}} of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the {{introduction}} of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first <b>gasworks</b> in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful <b>gasworks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a <b>gasworks</b> that remained operational until the 1920s. The <b>gasworks</b> {{is in the form}} of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 1945, a {{passenger}} train to Leeds and Bradford stalled in <b>Gasworks</b> Tunnel, ran back and was derailed in the station. Two {{people were killed}} and 25 were injured. Services were not fully restored until 23 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{light on}} the small rock of Oxcars was {{automated}} as early as 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton <b>gasworks.</b> A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Waddesdon Manor was {{complete}} in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch {{closed and the}} track was removed. The <b>gasworks</b> remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards. The track of the disused siding remained until at least 1916.|$|E
5|$|Electricity is {{supplied}} by Northern Ireland Electricity which was privatised in 1993 {{and is now}} a subsidiary of ESB Group. The <b>gasworks</b> used to be in North St., but {{there is no longer any}} town gas since it was abolished in Northern Ireland in the 1980s by the Thatcher government for being uneconomical, although it was restored to the greater Belfast area in 1996. Water {{is supplied}} by Northern Ireland Water, a public owned utility.|$|E
5|$|Following {{nationalisation}} of Britain's railways in 1948, {{the station}} transferred under British Railways to the Eastern Region although the old LTSR network west of <b>Gasworks</b> Junction {{was controlled by}} the London Midland Region. On 20 February 1949 the whole LTS line {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond <b>Gasworks</b> opened in 1848, and Richmond {{began to develop}} into a {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} imports to Plymouth from the Americas and Europe during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century included maize, wheat, barley, sugar cane, guano, sodium nitrate and phosphate. Aside from the dockyard in the town of Devonport, industries in Plymouth such as the <b>gasworks,</b> the railways and tramways, and a number of small chemical works had begun to develop in the 19th century, continuing into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Gas Light Company {{was formed}} in 1838 and the {{following}} year, gas lighting was provided and a <b>gasworks</b> was constructed on Eastgate. In 1866, the company was incorporated; in 1895–96, the works were rebuilt and lit the town until the company was nationalised in 1948. Gas ceased to be made here in the 1960s and the original buildings were retained although later extensions were demolished from 1966 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|A {{paper mill}} built in Partington more than 250years ago {{was the first}} factory in Trafford. The {{completion}} of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 transformed Partington into a major coal-exporting port and attracted a range of other industries. Until 2007 Shell Chemicals UK operated a major petrochemicals manufacturing complex in Carrington, Partington's closest neighbour, to the east. The gas storage facility in the north-eastern corner of the town was once a <b>gasworks</b> and another significant employer.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned <b>gasworks</b> in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, <b>Gasworks</b> Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a <b>gasworks,</b> breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at <b>gasworks</b> to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, the Slea was canalised in 1794 and the Sleaford Navigation Company {{constructed}} {{offices and}} wharves along Carre Street. The canal brought trade, while the Gothic-fronted <b>gasworks</b> on Eastgate lit the town from 1839. Benjamin Handley and Anthony Peacock financed and {{benefited from the}} navigation and founded the bank that took over Alvey's House on Northgate and later added a Baroque extension; Henry Handley, a Member of Parliament, is commemorated by the Handley Memorial on Southgate, a Gothic monument {{in the style of}} an Eleanor Cross. During the 1850s, the railways arrived and the station was built in a Gothic style. Sleaford's agricultural location and its new transport links encouraged seed trading and malting in the late 19th century: the seed merchant Charles Sharpe's house, The Pines, is on Boston Road. The massive Bass and Company maltings complex, constructed in brick off Mareham Lane between 1892 and 1905, is grade II* listed and has a frontage more than 1,000 feet long.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Sleaford's {{population}} more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The <b>gasworks</b> opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town. Sleaford's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, the slums around Westgate were over-crowded, lacking sanitation and disease-ridden; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850, when a report on the town's public health by the General Board of Health heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local Board of Health to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed clean water to be pumped into the town, but engineering problems and a reluctance to sell land to house the turbines had delayed the introduction of sewers.|$|E
5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding <b>gasworks</b> arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the <b>gasworks</b> continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring pleasure craft by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|This {{corner is}} also the former site of the country's longest-serving <b>gasworks,</b> which {{operated}} from 1863 to 1987, and a small industrial museum, the Dunedin <b>Gasworks</b> Museum, {{is located on the}} southern part of its site on Braemar Street. Opened to the public in 2001, this museum is one of only three known preserved <b>gasworks</b> museums in the world. The museum features five steam pumping engines which were used in the <b>gasworks,</b> and an older engine imported from Scotland in 1868. Three of the buildings within the <b>Gasworks</b> complex have NZHPT classifications: the skeleton of the 1879 gasometer, the exhauster and boiler house, and the fitting shop (all Category I).|$|E
25|$|In 1824, the Walsall Corporation {{received}} an Act of Parliament {{to improve the}} town by providing lighting and a <b>gasworks.</b> The <b>gasworks</b> was built in 1826 {{at a cost of}} £4,000. In 1825, the corporation built eleven tiled, brick almshouses for poor women. They were known to the area as 'Molesley's Almshouses'.|$|E

25|$|Derek Jarman's 1986 promotional {{video for}} The Smiths 'The Queen is Dead' single was partly shot at Beckton <b>Gasworks.</b>|$|E
25|$|British pop/rock trio The Outfield filmed {{multiple}} sequences for {{the video}} to the band's 1987 hit 'Since You've Been Gone', from their album Bangin', at Beckton <b>Gasworks.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{video for}} Loop's 1990 single 'Arc-lite' was filmed {{on the set}} of Full Metal Jacket. The <b>gasworks</b> was used as the main {{background}} scene for the Oasis video 'D'You Know What I Mean?', as it shows the band members playing on a concrete slab within the <b>gasworks.</b> The videoclip for Marcella Detroit's 1994 single 'I Believe' was shot in this location. Also, the 1995 TV series Bugs episode 'Out Of The Hive' shows the entire works in a scene where a car drives off an unfinished bridge in flames.|$|E
25|$|The first railway line {{to connect}} Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb {{received}} a <b>gasworks.</b> The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.|$|E
25|$|A fishermen's cottages row {{was under}} {{construction}} in the 1840s. However, the main developer died, and the project was abandoned, with the area used instead as a walled kitchen garden until the <b>gasworks</b> was built.|$|E
25|$|Other {{plans for}} the town include a {{shopping}} arcade, as well as fire and police stations and other municipal buildings. The museum also has the components of an early cinema, and those of a <b>gasworks</b> from Milnthorpe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{hour or so}} of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew Modine (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Huế, a Vietnamese city, to clear it of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick had the whole <b>gasworks</b> {{selectively}} demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old <b>gasworks</b> and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile. According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full Metal Jacket, the <b>gasworks</b> were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Huế.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gasworks</b> {{themselves}} were demolished in September 1972, but the railway siding and the concrete foundations {{of a gas}} holder are still visible on the site today. The company offices at 161 Ryrie Street are now listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} World War I {{capacity}} at the <b>gasworks</b> was stretched, so in 1924 {{the works}} were rebuilt with new technology. 1925 was the first industrial use of gas, before {{this time it was}} primarily used in households. The company built new offices at 161 Ryrie Street in 1920.|$|E
