40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: <b>Imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> is the {{drug of choice}} for equine piroplasmosis, but its administration causes severe colic and diarrhoea. An imidocarb protocol that reduces these signs is required. Objectives: (1) Quantification {{of the effects of}} <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on equine orocaecal transit time (OCTT), with and without atropine or glycopyrrolate premedication; (2) Investigation of an improved pre-treatment regimen for imidocarb administration. Hypothesis: Treatment with <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> will result in colic and reduced OCTT as demonstrated by the lactose 13 C-ureide breath test (LUBT), which will be ameliorated by premedication with atropine or glycopyrrolate. Methods: The effects of three drug therapies on OCTT were compared in six healthy horses in a randomised double-blind study versus a saline control: (i) <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 2. 4 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) with intravenous saline (I/S); (ii) <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 2. 4 mg/kg IM with atropine 0. 035 mg/kg IV (I/A); (iii) <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 2. 4 mg/kg IM with glycopyrrolate 0. 0025 mg/kg IV (I/G). The LUBT was used to measure OCTT in each case, and significance of treatment effect determined by a linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: I/A treatment caused an increase in OCTT (P < 0. 05), whereas I/S produced a non-significant decrease in OCTT. I/S caused colic and diarrhoea in four of six horses after injection, which was not seen in any horse with I/A or I/G treatments or saline control. Intestinal borborygmi were increased in I/S and decreased in I/A treated individuals respectively. Conclusions: I/S treatment induced colic signs and a potential reduction in OCTT, whilst I/A treatment increased OCTT significantly when compared to I/S. Both atropine and glycopyrrolate premedication ameliorated the clinical gastrointestinal effects of imidocarb, but atropine produced significant inhibition of gastric and/or small intestinal motility, which was not seen with glycopyrrolate. Pre-medication with glycopyrrolate is recommended when using imidocarb for equine piroplasmosis. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State UniversityThe primary work {{presented}} involves {{evaluation of}} the apicomplexan hemoparasite Theileria equi for <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> resistance, assessment of possible alternative treatment options, and investigation of the potential role for ATP-binding cassette transporters in drug resistance. An in vitro drug susceptibility assay was developed and adapted to multiple different drugs. The susceptibility of two T. equi isolates and a lab generated variant to both <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and the experimental bumped kinase inhibitor 1294 was assessed. Two distinct isolates of T. equi had an almost four-fold difference in <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> susceptibility, and a variant generated through continuous in vitro <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> exposure developed a further 15 -fold decrease in susceptibility. In contrast, {{there was no difference}} in susceptibility to bumped kinase inhibitor 1294, suggesting that these drugs may represent a possible alternative for resistant T. equi parasites. Also presented is the failure of four T. equi infected ponies to clear infection with the USDA Florida strain despite two rounds of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> treatment, a demonstration of drug resistance in vivo. This collective data raises concern for the existence and emergence of drug resistance at the parasite level. An investigation was undertaken of the 45 putative T. equi ATP-binding cassette transporters as potential mediators of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> efflux leading to drug resistance. Selection of the most likely candidate transporters based on differential transcription was accomplished using RNA sequencing. No experiments performed in this study supported <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> as a substrate for efflux by the most differentially expressed ABC transporter BEWA_ 032300, however there are other transporters of interest and other mechanisms by which ABC transporters can contribute to drug resistance for further investigation. The described drug assay was utilized in a collaborative project to examine the effect of environmental exposures on the stability and efficacy of buparvaquone and parvaquone. T. equi was used as a model organism for Theileria parva, for which these drugs are vital in prophylaxis and treatment. It was found that air exposure causes significant drug degradation and subsequent loss of efficacy, a finding that has implications for successful treatment as well as the prevention of drug resistance development.

The lactose 13 C-ureide breath test was used to measure OCTT in each case and significance of treatment effect determined by a linear model analysis of variance. Results: Imidocarb/atropine treatment caused an increase in OCTT (P&# 60; 0. 05) whereas imidocarb/saline produced a nonsignificant decrease in OCTT. Imidocarb/saline caused colic and diarrhoea in 4 of 6 horses, which were not seen in any of the horses treated with imidocarb/atropine or imidocarb/glycopyrrolate or administered the saline control.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that four {{intramuscular}} doses of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> administered at 72 -hour treatment intervals are effective in sterilising experimental Babesia equi infections in horses. It has also been documented that <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> has dose dependent hepato- and nephrotoxic effects in a number of species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the clinical and clinicopathological effects of this multiple treatment regime of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in healthy ponies. Specific emphasis was placed on the potential adverse effects on hepatic and renal function in this species. Serum bile acids and serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity were measured to evaluate the effect of this treatment regime on hepatic function. The diffuse hepatocellular necrosis and pronounced periportal hepatocellular swelling and degeneration previously reported as the most consistent hepatic lesions noted in equines following imidocarb treatment were not evident at the dose and dosage interval used in this study. Urinary gamma glutamyltransferase: creatinine ratios (IU/g) and fractional clearance of sodium, potassium and phosphate (%) were calculated as a measure of renal function. Urinary GGT and urinary GGT: creatinine ratios were significantly elevated on Day 5 of the trial and were considered indicative of transient changes in renal function. The rapid return to previous baseline values supported reported observations that changes between 25 and 100 IU/g may be a function of drug excretion and are not necessarily indicative of significant nephrotoxicity. It was concluded that four intramuscular treatments of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> at a dose of 4 mg/kg every 72 hours may be a relatively safe method whereby persistent Babesia equi infections can be sterilised.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> {{for the treatment}} of Hepatozoon canis infection was studied in three naturally infected asymptomatic dogs followed longitudinally over 8 months. Response to treatment was followed by monitoring blood counts, parasitemia levels in blood, parasite in concentrated buffy-coat smears and by PCR. The dogs were initially treated with a low dose of 3. mg/kg <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> twice a month and when parasitemia persisted after five treatments, with the regular dose of 6. mg/kg. In one dog, H. canis gamonts were no longer detectable by blood and buffy-coat microscopy after 2 months of therapy with 6. mg/kg while in the two other dogs gamonts were intermittently found in blood but persistently detectable in buffy-coat smears during the whole study period. Furthermore, combined therapy with doxycycline monohydrate administered at 10. mg/kg/day PO for 4 weeks also failed to eliminate H. canis. PCR revealed that parasite DNA was present in the blood of all dogs at all sampling dates regardless of treatment refuting the effectiveness of treatment suggested by negative blood microscopy. Detection of H. canis in buffy coat was found to be twice as sensitive than by blood smear and detection by PCR was even more sensitive revealing infection in eight samples (16 % of total samples) negative by blood and buffy-coat microscopy.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{treatment}} of persistent infection to eliminate transmission risk represents a specific challenge requiring compelling evidence of complete pathogen clearance. The limited repertoire of antimicrobial agents targeted at protozoal parasites magnifies this challenge.

The equine theileriosis, {{caused by}} Theileria equi, is an endemic disease of south of Rio Grande do Sul Brazil. There {{are signs that}} tick Rhipicephalus boophilus microplus still transmit that disease and in few time, some studies had experimental demonstrated it. The purpose of the first study {{of this paper was}} to demonstrate the tick infestation and the role of it in the transmission of the disease. In equines with contact directly with cattle, the serum incidence of the disease was 81, 8 % and in this group, 31, 8 % of this horses had tick infestation. In the equines that didn t have contact with cattle, the incidence of the disease was 12 % and no tick was found in this horses. The most efficient drug in the treatment of the disease is <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> Many studies had demonstrated different doses and protocols of treatment of the disease and the toxicity of it was obvious. No study had show the sterile of T. equi with this drug, but it s a way to treat the acute disease and to control the chronic theileriosis. The acute form of the disease is seemed with fever, icteric and death. The chronic kind of it is seemed with covered coat, hyporexia, low performance in athlete horses and loss of weight. The goal of the second study of this paper was to show the toxicity and the metabolic effects of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> drug into two protocols of treatment (two groups, 2 and 4 mg/kg) in serum positive horses to theileriosis.

40|$|Hepatozoonosis {{caused by}} Hepatozoon canis (Eucoccidiorida, Hepatozoidae) {{is among the}} most {{widespread}} vector-borne infections of dogs, primarily transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks. Based on the absence of a consensus on the treatment regimes for canine hepatozoonosis, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (5 - 6 mg/kg subcutaneously once a week for 6 weeks), and of toltrazuril/emodepside (Procox(®), 15 mg/kg once a day for 6 days) in association with clindamycin (15 mg/kg once a day for 21 days) in treating naturally infected dogs. At the enrollment time (T 0), 32 dogs, cytologically or molecularly positive for H. canis, were assigned to test and control groups. Animals were treated according to the specific therapeutic protocol, and the presence of H. canis gamonts was assessed weekly by cytology and PCR throughout six months (T 1 -T 19). In addition, any abnormality in leucocyte morphology was evaluated and recorded. Results indicate that, in spite of a reduction in the percentage of infected dogs, both treatments did not provide parasitological cure. Accordingly, new treatment protocols or active compounds against H. canis should be investigated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{group of}} 8 dogs {{was treated with}} an imidacloprid/flumethrin collar (Seresto®) 28 days prior to {{infestation}} with adult Dermacentor reticulatus ticks, infected with Babesia canis. The ability of the collar to prevent transmission of B. canis in the treated group was compared to an untreated control group. All 8 dogs in the untreated control group became infected with B. canis parasites, which were detected in blood smears as early as day 6 post tick-application. All control dogs developed clinical signs of babesiosis and were rescue-treated with <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate.</b> These dogs also developed specific B. canis antibodies as identified by serology (IFA test) and were confirmed PCR/RLB positive. None of the 8 dogs treated with the imidacloprid/flumethrin collar became infected with B. canis, which was confirmed {{by the absence of}} specific B. canis antibodies and babesial DNA as confirmed by PCR/RLB. The collar caused 96. 02 % of the ticks to die within 48 h post challenge and this increased to 100 % within 4 days. Although a high percentage of 44 % of the Dermacentor ticks were infected with B. canis, they were unable to transmit the infection to the treated group. Hence, the imidacloprid/flumethrin collar effectively prevented transmission of B. canis 1 month after application onto the dogs...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{babesiosis}} is {{a frequent}} and clinically significant tick-borne disease. Sixty symptomatic dogs with clinical findings compatible with babesiosis were {{included in this study}} conducted in Serbia. After clinical examination, blood samples were taken for microscopic examination, complete blood count (CBC), Canine SNAP 4 Dx Test, DNA analyses and sequencing. The main clinical signs included apathy, anorexia, fever, brown/red discoloration of urine, pale mucous membranes, icterus, splenomegaly, and vomiting. The main clinicopathological findings in Babesia infections were a slight to severe thrombocytopenia and a mild to very severe normocytic normochromic anaemia. Microscopic evaluation revealed 58 positive samples with the presence of large and small intraerythrocytic piroplasms in 57 and 1 sample(s), respectively. No co-infections were found using SNAP test. Two Babesia species, B. canis (58 / 60) and B. gibsoni (2 / 60), were differentiated by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Species identification was further confirmed by sequencing PCR products of B. gibsoni samples and six randomly selected B. canis samples. All dogs were treated with <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (6. 6 mg/kg of body weight), given intramuscularly twice at an interval of 14 days.

40|$|Haematological {{variables}} and selected serum indices, particularly those affected {{by changes in}} renal and hepatic function, were examined in 6 healthy ponies following 4 intramuscular doses of 4 mg/kg <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> administered every 72 hours. This treatment regime {{has been reported to}} sterilise experimental Babesia equi infections in horses and may have value in preventing the spread of this disease during exportation of possible carrier horses to non-endemic countries. Serum bile acids and serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity were measured to evaluate the effect of this treatment regime on hepatic function. Owing to the absence of any increase in these variables it was concluded that this treatment regime had no clinically detectable deleterious effect on hepatic function in healthy ponies. Urinary gamma glutamyltransferase : creatinine ratios (IU/g), serum creatinine and fractional clearance of sodium, potassium and phosphate (%) were calculated as a measure of renal function. Urinary GGT and urinary GGT : creatinine ratios were significantly elevated on Day 5 of the trial, with 2 of the trial animals also exhibiting mild azotaemia indicative of changes in renal function. The changes in urine GGT : urine creatinine ratios observed in this study also provides evidence of the value of this ratio for the early detection of renal toxicity, following exposure to nephrotoxic agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological findings of Babesia infection in 32 dogs in northern Australia are presented. Eleven different breed types were represented from 6 localities in north Queensland and one locality in northern Western Australia. Twenty three (72 %) were males. Babesia-infected dogs were grouped {{by the degree}} of haematological disturbance and clinical severity: Acute babesiosis (25 / 32), all pups with severe haemolytic anaemia; subclinical carriers (5 / 32) with non-specific malaise, characterised haematologically by a normal erythrogram but marked leucopenia; chronic anaemia, observed in 2 adult dogs. Pups were azotaemic (serum urea > 6. 6 mmol/l) and had elevated serum bilirubin levels (20. 8 to 48. 5 mmol/l). Total serum protein was usually within the normal range. Pups that died were also hypoglycaemic and severely hyperkalaemic (K+> 10 mmol/l). Low parasitaemias in routine blood smears complicated diagnosis but smears made from ear or toe capillaries, or after haematocrit concentration, greatly enhanced finding parasitised cells. At necropsy, pallor and jaundice were the most consistent observations. Haemoglobinuric nephrosis, an active reticulo-endothelial system and capillaries packed {{with large numbers of}} infected erythrocytes were the main histopathological findings. A combination of <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> at 5 mg/kg body weight, given intramuscularly, with fluid therapy and blood transfusion was the most successful treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 50 adult cows each of Friesian and Jersey breed {{maintained}} at the Livestock Experiment Station Bhunikey (Pattoki) District Kasur were selected randomly for this study. Blood smears of all animals were prepared aseptically through standard procedure. The cows found positive for theileriasis {{were treated with}} Buparvaquone (Butalex) injection @ 5 ml/ 100 Kg b. wt. intramuscularly, while {{for the treatment of}} babesiasis, positive animals were treated with <b>Imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> 12 % w/v (Imizol) @ 2 ml/ 100 Kg b. wt.

The overall incidence of theileriasis in Holstein-Friesian and Jersey cows was 24 and 15 per cent, respectively, while the incidence of babesiasis was 2. 5 per cent in both the breeds. The highest incidence of Theilaria, i. e., 38 and 30 per cent was observed in Holstein-Friesian and Jersey cows during 3 PPrd and 4 th quarter of the year, respectively. The lowest incidence of Theileria was observed during 1 st quarter in both Holstein-Friesian and Jersey cows (16 and 8 percent, respectively).

40|$|Canine {{babesiosis}} is {{a relatively}} frequent disease in Croatia. Elevated body temperature, anemia and haemoglobinuria {{are the most common}} signs. Diagnosis is rapidly obtained by employing blood smears, as B. canis is present in the red blood cells of affected dogs. Treatment is favourable and without consequences. Blood work was performed initialy, prior to treatment, and on the 1 st and the 7 th day following treatment. Following history and examination of the dogs blood and urine samples were taken. After confirmation of B. canis in the red blood cells, alltogether 226 dogs were tretated. Out of them 80 were tretaed with Berenil® (diminazen aceturate, Hoechst), 72 were tretated with Imizol® (<b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> Schering-Plough-Animal-Health) and 74 with Oxopirvedin® (fenamidine dizetionate, Merial). Clinical findings, haematological analysis and urine analysis are given and statistically assesed. After tretment with Berenil®, symptoms of babesiosis regressed within 24 hours. Health improved more slowly in the group treated with Oxopirvedin® in comparioson with the group treated with Berenil®. Contrary to the above, Imizol® displayed the slowest regression of the disease and reinfestation with B. canis within 30 days was not noted. That is not the case if treatment was provided by Berenil® and Oxopirvedin®. In all 226 cases of canine babesiosis side effects were not noted, except topically inflammed tissue at the site of subcutaneous application...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{work was}} {{performed}} to investigate {{the effect of a}} potent anti-protozoan drug, Imidocarb on the cell mediated and humoral immune response to foot and mouth disease vaccine (FMDV, O 1 strain) in normal and Anaplasmosis-infected calves. Materials and Methods: A total of 55 male mixed bred calves were used and divided into two main groups of 25 calves each. The first group was healthy and the second was Anaplasma - infected calves. FMDV was administered in both groups. Calves of the first and second groups were subdivided into equal five subgroups of 5 calves each. The first subgroup was vaccinated control. The treated subgroups were each given 3 mg / kg body weight <b>Imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> in a single intramuscular dose at one week before vaccination, at time of vaccination, one week and two weeks post vaccination with FMDV (O 1), respectively. The cellular immune response in the different groups was evaluated weekly, however antibody titers were measured by ELISA and serum neutralization test Results: Imidocarb increased rate of erythrocyte rosette forming lymphocytes when it was administered one week before vaccination, at time of vaccination and one week post vaccination. Imidocarb increased antibody titre of FMDV in both normal and anaplasmosis-infected calves. The protection rate due to challenge with virulent FMDV was high in treated calves as compared with the vaccinated control. Conclusion: The best immunopotentiating effect of Imidocarb is achieved by dosing one week before vaccinating calves with FMD vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Histological and {{electron}} microscopic {{examinations of}} the kidneys of 8 dogs suffering from fatal, naturally acquired Babesia canis infection and nephropathy are presented. Seven animals {{were treated with}} <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> on average 4. 5 days prior to death. Severe anaemia was present only in 2 cases. Degenerative histological changes observed mostly in the proximal convoluted tubules included vacuolar-hydropic degeneration, necrosis and detachment of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells from the basement membrane. Necrotic debris occasionally formed acidophilic casts within the tubules. In some cases, necrosis of the whole tubule was observed. Haemoglobin casts in the tubules and haemoglobin droplets in RTE cells seldom appeared. No significant histological changes were seen in the glomeruli. Ultrastructural lesions in RTE cells included nuclear membrane hyperchromatosis, karyopyknosis, karyolysis, swelling or collapse of mitochondria with fragmentation of cristae and vacuolar-hydropic degeneration in the endoplasmic reticulum and microvilli. Nuclear oedema was also observed. Many RTE cells exhibiting necrosis collapsed. Vacuolar-hydropic degeneration and necrosis were also observed in the glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelium. The severe acute tubular necrosis described {{in this study is}} probably the result of hypoxic renal injury. Systemic hypotension leading to vasoconstriction in the kidneys might be the most important cause of renal hypoxia in B. canis infections, but anaemia may also contribute to inadequate oxygenation. Imidocarb should be applied with caution in patients with possible renal involvement until further data become available on its potential nephrotoxicity in dogs...|$|E

40|$|A 15 -month-old, female mongrel dog was {{presented}} with a 6 -week history of inappetence, weight loss, and tetraparesis. Physical examination revealed weakness, poor body condition, mild fever, pale mucous membranes, and diffuse muscle atrophy. The right hind limb was painful and edematous, with large ecchymoses. The femur was irregular on palpation and moderate popliteal lymphadenopathy was evident. Results of a CBC showed severe anemia with mild regeneration, an inflammatory leukogram with 90 % of neutrophils parasitized by Hepatozoon sp. gamonts, and moderate thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate had myeloid hyperplasia and contained a few extracellular Hepatozoon meronts and a few intracellular gamonts within neutrophils. Serum chemistry abnormalities included hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity. Radiologic findings of the right femur included periosteal bone proliferation and lesions compatible with osteomyelitis. A fine needle aspirate specimen from the bone lesion had neutrophilic inflammation; 36 % of the neutrophils contained Hepatozoon gamonts. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis included a protein concentration of 37 mg/dL and marked mononuclear pleocytosis (243 cell/mu L) with a predominance of lymphocytes. An ELISA was positive for Hepatozoon canis and PCR results with DNA sequencing confirmed infection with this organism. A diagnosis of hepatozoonosis with skeletal involvement and meningoencephalomyelitis was made. The dog recovered almost completely neurologically and had no gamonts in the blood after 60 days of therapy with <b>imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and prednisone.

40|$|Babesiosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tick-borne hemoproto-zoan diseases that affects dogs worldwide. In the last years, there has been a sharp increase in positive cases of Babesia canis infection in the Falcon State, Venezuela. Although recent studies conducted in South America suggest that B. canis vo-geli might be the species present in Venezuela, no data on the pathogenesis and molecular characteristics of Venezuelan pi-roplasms are available at this moment. By this reason the pres-ent work was undertaken to describe the evolution of an ex-perimental infection induced in dogs, as well as the first mo-lecular characterization of the 18 S rRNA gene of the Venezue-lan B. canis isolate used for inoculating the experimental ani-mals. Experimental infection was carried out in four dogs, two of them splenectomized. The animals were inoculated with 1 x 10 B. canis infected-red blood cells. Parasitemia, packed cell volume and body temperature were measured daily. Prepatent period of the infection oscillated between 2 - 6 days. All of the inoculated dogs developed a mild-type disease. Symptoms of canine piroplasmosis were moderate, and main clinical findings consisted in low parasitemia, short febrile period and slight anaemia. <b>Imidocarb</b> <b>dipropionate</b> showed to be the treatment of choice, since it cleared parasites from blood, as demon-strated by PCR assays. The partial sequence of the ssu rRNA gene of the Venezuelan piroplasm showed 100 % identity with a Brazilian isolate of Babesia canis vogeli, which is in full con-cordance with the clinical signs caused by this subspecies in the experimental animals, as well as those reported previously by other authors...|$|E
