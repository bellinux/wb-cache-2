25|$|Also {{indirect}} {{constraints on}} neutrino velocity, {{on the basis}} of effective field theories such as SME, can be achieved by searching for threshold effects such as Vacuum Cherenkov radiation. For example, neutrinos should exhibit Bremsstrahlung in the form of <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair</b> production. Another possibility in the same framework is the investigation of the decay of pions into muons and neutrinos. Superluminal neutrinos would considerably delay those decay processes. The absence of those effects indicate tight limits for velocity differences between light and neutrinos.|$|E
25|$|The fine-structure {{constant}} is {{the coupling}} constant of quantum electrodynamics (QED) determining {{the strength of}} the interaction between electrons and photons. It turns out that the fine structure constant is not really a constant at all owing to the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electron-positron field. The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair</b> production, the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.|$|E
25|$|Muons are {{unstable}} elementary {{particles and}} are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter {{than all other}} matter particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because leptonic family numbers are conserved {{in the absence of}} an extremely unlikely immediate neutrino oscillation, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino (antimuon decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below). Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair),</b> are produced.|$|E

25|$|Pair production: This becomes {{possible}} with gamma energies exceeding 1.02 MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5 MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By {{interaction with the}} electric field of a nucleus, {{the energy of the}} incident photon is converted into the mass of an <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair.</b> Any gamma energy in excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's range, it combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least 0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the annihilated particles).|$|E
25|$|When a high-energy (TeV) gamma photon or cosmic ray {{interacts with}} the Earth's atmosphere, it may produce an <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair</b> with {{enormous}} velocities.

Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment HAWC, the Pierre Auger Observatory and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large neutrino detectors, such as the Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and IceCube. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as STACEE, a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Core {{collapse}} can {{be caused}} by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or photodisintegration. When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will {{no longer be able to}} support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole. [...] Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results. [...] <b>Electron-positron</b> <b>pair</b> production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova. [...] A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.|$|E

In the majority of annihilation events, two gamma quanta are created that are, in the reference frame of the <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair,</b> emitted in exactly opposite directions. In the laboratory frame, {{there is a small}} angular deviation from collinearity, which is caused by the momentum of the electron.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} supermassive black holes {{remains an open}} field of research. Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is {{in place in the}} center of a galaxy, it can grow by {{accretion}} of matter and by merging with other black holes. There are, however, several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or [...] "seeds", of supermassive black holes. The most obvious hypothesis is that the seeds are black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a large gas cloud in the period before the first stars formed collapsing into a [...] "quasi-star" [...] and then a black hole of initially only around , and then rapidly accreting to become relatively quickly an intermediate-mass black hole, and possibly a SMBH if the accretion-rate is not quenched at higher masses. [...] The initial [...] "quasi-star" [...] would become unstable to radial perturbations because of <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pair</b> production in its core, and may collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion which would eject most of its mass and prevent it from leaving a black hole as a remnant.|$|E

40|$|Many {{models of}} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{as well as}} of soft gamma {{repeaters}} (SGRs) involve a fireball — an optically thick concentration of radiation energy with a high ratio of energy density to rest mass. We study the asymptotic behavior of an ultrarelativistic fireball consisting of <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pairs</b> and photons. We show that in the ultrarelativistic limit, after photons decouple from the pairs, the photon distribution function remains a blackbody spectrum in some appropriate Lorentz frame, allowing us to define an effective Lorentz factor and temperature for the photon gas. We also study the freezing out of <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pairs</b> and their asymptotic Lorentz factor γ∞. The dependence of these quantities on initial conditions can be described by simple scaling laws. We apply our results to SGR 1806 - 20 and find that the energy carried by <b>electron-positron</b> <b>pairs</b> is higher than calculated by former estimates, but is still an order of magnitude short of the minimum energy required to produce the observed afterglow. A viable solution of the energy budget is that the fireball is loaded by baryons or electromagnetic flux. ...|$|R
