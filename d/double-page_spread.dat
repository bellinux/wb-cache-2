500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a <b>double-page</b> <b>spread.</b> This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we {{have never been able to}} let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
500|$|High-profile {{advertising}} {{was central}} to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out {{in stark contrast to}} the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a <b>double-page</b> <b>spread.</b> The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan [...] "Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you". The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as [...] "a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs." [...] The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed ("it's still very simple to teach yourself computing") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as [...] "eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was [...] "designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain." [...] Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose: ...|$|E

Through the Window in particular showcases many of Keeping's techniques and themes. Told {{through the eyes of}} a small boy watching events in the street outside from his bedroom window, the illustrations are full of intense evening light and colour, movement, and even, when a horse-drawn dray rattles across a <b>double-page</b> <b>spread,</b> virtual sound. Other picture books include Richard (1973), about a day in the life of a police horse; Wasteground Circus (1975), on the transient but magical effect on two young boys of the circus coming to town; and Willie's Fire Engine (1980), a romantic, dreamlike tale of a young Edinburgh boy's dream of being a firefighter.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, a {{national}} press ad for Asda on a <b>double-page</b> <b>spread</b> was headed [...] "The big Asda Rollback" [...] with headings stating [...] "Lower prices on everything you buy, week in week out" [...] with equal prominence to a column headed [...] "Lower prices {{than any other}} supermarket"; that the arrows underneath the heading [...] "Lower prices than any other supermarket" [...] compared prices at Asda with prices at Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons. The ASA ruled that in {{the context in which}} it appeared, it was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted either as referring to price reductions that had taken place within Asda or to price comparisons with the named competitors. In addition, because the ad did not explain that the price reductions had not necessarily taken place in the week that immediately preceded the ad, they concluded that the headings which stated the number of price reductions that had taken place in each product category were misleading. The ASA also concluded that the [...] "Lower prices than any other supermarket" [...] claim in the advert was misleading.|$|E

Already familiar with Nick Landau (acting editor), when another artist dropped out, Bolland was called directly to complete a Judge Dredd story in Prog 41 (3 Dec 77) and soon was established as a regular artist on the series. [...] "From that point on," [...] writes Bolland, [...] "either he [...] or his successor Steve MacManus called me direct whenever they wanted me to do a Dredd story." [...] Dredd stories started as traditional UK comic stories, i.e. [...] "six-page one-offs... Pat Mills and John Wagner seem to spurn the American comic idea of continuing stories or, worse, the idea of a 2000 AD continuity between characters," [...] Bolland seeing this as a [...] "strength... hav one great new idea each week." [...] Soon, though, the writers began to craft serials, and Bolland's distinct abilities with subtle facial expressions, dramatic lighting and the dynamic composition of page layout made him the perfect choice to draw the ongoing sagas, starting with [...] "The Lunar Olympics". Bolland contributed artwork to such Judge Dredd story-arcs as [...] "Luna Period", [...] "The Cursed Earth", [...] "The Day the Law Died", [...] "The Judge Child Quest" [...] and [...] "Block Mania". As the Dredd stories rose in popularity, they [...] "were moved so they started on the middle pages" [...] with a colour <b>double-page</b> <b>spread,</b> which Bolland [...] "always struggled with" [...] finding it [...] "very difficult... to fill that space most effectively." [...] Ultimately the weekly deadlines meant that Bolland was unable to produce all episodes of the epic storylines himself, and the art chores on The Cursed Earth were split between Bolland and Mike McMahon.|$|E
