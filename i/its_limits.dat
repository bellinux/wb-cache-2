5|$|Historical {{knowledge}} about Sogdia is somewhat hazy {{during the period}} of the Parthian Empire (247 BC – 224 AD) in Persia. The subsequent Sasanian Empire of Persia conquered and incorporated Sogdia as a satrapy in 260, an inscription dating to the reign of Shapur I noting that <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> formed the northeastern Sasanian borderlands with the Kushan Empire. However, by the 5th century the region was captured by the rival Hephthalite Empire.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle {{continued}} to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted {{a visit from the}} Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to <b>its</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
500|$|Intuition and {{ambiguous}} teaching lead {{students to think}} of the limit of a sequence as a kind of infinite process rather than a fixed value, since a sequence need not reach <b>its</b> <b>limit.</b> Where students accept the difference between a sequence of numbers and <b>its</b> <b>limit,</b> they might read [...] "0.999..."

5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E
5|$|Neila's {{interactions}} with choreographers and dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions in Singapore inspired her {{to create new}} Indian dance steps based on classical foundations; for instance, her dance-drama Kannagi, staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998, {{was said to have}} stretched tradition to <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> and offered something to a range of audiences far wider than a traditional dance-drama would have done. Up to 2007, Neila had choreographed dance segments for the last 13 Chingay Parades, street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities.|$|E
5|$|The Act of February 18, 1895 {{amended the}} {{previous}} year's borough bill {{to raise the}} requirement for incorporation petitions from owners of 10 {{percent of the land}} value to 50 percent. The rush was also slowed by the legislature deciding that no borough created thereafter could maintain a separate school system unless there were at least 400 children living within <b>its</b> <b>limits.</b> With the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders by then at 28 members, divided evenly between the parties, the legislature passed a bill setting the number of members of such boards in third-class counties (including Bergen) at 9, with the freeholders elected from the Delford-style boroughs to go out of office on May 8. Nevertheless, on May 9, electors in what became the borough of Englewood Cliffs voted to secede from Englewood, 34–1.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean {{army had}} been pushed to <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at much reduced strength and effectiveness by the end of August. Logistical problems wracked the North Koreans, with shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers common. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans, and the UN had near-total superiority over the air and sea. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and it had fewer than 100 tanks by September 1, compared to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative, as the North Korean troops retained a high morale and enough supplies to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has <b>its</b> <b>limits,</b> and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the U.S. Army {{participated in}} Operation Overlord, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy. After heavy fighting, the Allies {{broke out of}} Normandy in July 1944. Efforts to capture the ports in Brittany proved difficult, but Allied forces quickly liberated Belgium and much of France. U.S. forces participated in the invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) in August 1944, and the airborne assault on the Netherlands (Operation Market Garden) in September, but logistical difficulties and German resistance slowed U.S. assaults on the Siegfried Line and in Lorraine in late 1944. In December 1944, the U.S. Army {{was surprised by the}} German Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge), which was defeated only after costly fighting that strained the U.S. Army's manpower to <b>its</b> <b>limits.</b> In February 1945, operations began that drove the Germans from the Rhineland, and the Rhine was crossed in March 1945. In April 1945, U.S. Army forces entered the heartland of Germany. Operations continued until the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 with the signing of unconditional surrender the previous day.|$|E

5|$|Mobile {{has more}} than 45 public parks within <b>its</b> <b>limits,</b> with some that are of special note. Bienville Square is a {{historic}} park in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District. It assumed its current form in 1850 and is named for Mobile's founder, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville. It was once a principal gathering place for {{the citizens of the}} city and remains popular today. Cathedral Square is a one-block performing arts park, also in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District, that is overlooked by the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. Fort Conde is a reconstruction of the city's original Fort Condé, built on the original fort's footprint. It serves as the official welcome center and colonial-era living history museum. Spanish Plaza is a downtown park that honors the Spanish phase of the city between 1780 and 1813. It features the Arches of Friendship, a fountain presented to Mobile by the city of Málaga, Spain. Langan Park, the largest of the parks at , features lakes, natural spaces, and contains the Mobile Museum of Art, Azalea City Golf Course, Mobile Botanical Gardens and Playhouse in the Park.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{initially}} did not mark numbered routes within <b>its</b> <b>limits.</b> In 1932, the New York Automobile Club {{drafted a}} plan establishing alignments for several routes through the city. In this plan, NY9A went south through the Bronx and into Manhattan on Broadway while US9 used Riverdale Avenue north of 230th Street. As a result, the two routes {{would have had}} a short concurrency across Spuyten Duyvil Creek. NY9A would have split to the south on Tenth Avenue at 218th Street in order to join the Harlem River Drive via Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street. From there it would head west on 155th Street to Amsterdam Avenue, where it would head south to 79th Street, heading west there to rejoin US9 at Riverside Drive. US9 would have continued south through lower Manhattan to Staten Island via the Staten Island Ferry; however, it is unclear whether NY9A would have continued south with US9 to lower Manhattan.|$|E
