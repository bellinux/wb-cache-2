For {{reducing}} <b>heald</b> <b>frame’s</b> vibration {{and noise}} {{in the process of}} weaving, composite of Carbon-Fibre was applied to it, and three methods of lay up for laminate was designed in the paper. Finite element model of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was set up, and element shell 181 was used to simulate different layers of the composite material, then some important natural frequencies and vibration modes were calculated, and the results of that was compared with another <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> made of aluminium alloy. The analysis result indicated that, the second method for laying had an optimum dynamic characteristics, based on that, fundamental frequency of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was increased by 19. 48 Hz, and self-weight of it was lightened about 26. 82 %. In results, lightweight design of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was come true, at the same time, vibration resistance of it was also strengthened effectively...|$|R

40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the <b>Heald</b> <b>frames.</b> The <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The drafting plan of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital Crimp Tester and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing fancy weave...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to eliminate the residual vibration of shedding system and the associated mechanism that connects the heddle shafts with the cam mechanisms. Effective cam design method which is based on motion design of the cam pitch curve by “blends ” of the traditional profiles, formed by superimposing three functions; a cycloid, a ramped versine, and a ramp called as ramp-plus-ramped cycloid-plus-ramped versine is proposed in this study. This function is reshaped using the system’s natural frequency and damping ratio to yield almost zero residual vibration of the heddle shaft. The proposed method is then compared with the well known cam curves and its applicability is shown by simulation and experimental results. The results show that the proposed method is quite effective for fast vibration free motion of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|R
50|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of part of the warp yarn to form a shed (the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or <b>heald</b> <b>frame,</b> {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that weaving mills become noisy with {{increasing}} speed of a jet loom. One of the authors used the <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> equipped with bar magnets {{in order to reduce the}} heald vibration, and reported that the disorder of the heald motion during shedding motion was improved. Then, sound heard by human ears seemed reduced, but there was no significant difference in the noise level measured with the noise-level meter. In this report, therefore, the high response sound measuring system was arranged in order to obtain the time chart of sound pressure level caused by healds during shedding motion. High-speed video-camera was also used in order to observe the healds motion. It was clarified that the noise was significantly connected with healds motion during shedding motion. Large sound occurred in two cases : when healds collided with the heald bar vertically near the upper dead point of shedding motion and when healds collided at random by rebounds around the lower dead point of shedding motion...|$|R

It is characterised by a heald attachment into the heald shaft with a necessary design allowance. The preparation of a mathematical model for the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> is explained in this study. A damping element for dissipating the energy created during the heald impact on the carrying wire of the heald shaft is currently used for the high-speed weaving loom. This system makes use of a damping element, fitted in the profile of the rod at an optimum distance from heald eye. This element provides for reduction of the heald velocity before its drop upon the supporting wire because the opposite section of the heald is pressed into the rubber element. The calculated results of the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> are compared with the existing solution without application of the damping element...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of <b>frame</b> {{compliance}} and <b>rider</b> mobility on the scooter stability. Particular attention {{is given to the}} wobble mode, because it may easily become unstable in the vehicle speed range. This article includes a synthetic discussion of previous works, presents a new mathematical model, and discusses the results of both numerical and experimental analyses of the vehicle stability by varying the vehicle characteristics and motion conditions. The mathematical model describes the out-of-plane dynamics of the scooter and consists of a twelve-degree-freedom linear model. It describes the main scooter features and, in particular, includes the <b>frame</b> compliance, <b>rider</b> mobility, and an advanced tire model. The torsion and bending compliance of both the front fork and swingarm are modelled using lumped rotational springs; similarly, the rider mobility is described by means of two soft springs which connect the rider body to the chassis. The tire model describes in detail the carcass geometry and its compliance. The full scooter model is available on the website www. dinamoto. it and has been derived using 'MBSymba', which is a package for the symbolic modelling of multibody systems. The scooter stability has been investigated at both low and high speeds; in particular, {{the effect of}} vehicle compliance and rider mobility on the weave and wobble modes have been examined. Numerical simulations show that the bending flexibility of the front fork stabilizes wobble mode at high speed and has a contrary effect at low speed, whereas the torsion flexibility of the fork {{does not appear to have}} a remarkable influence; the bending flexibility of the swingarm slightly stabilizes the weave mode at very high speeds whereas the torsion flexibility of the swingarm has a contrary effect. The effect of rider mobility is to stabilize the weave mode at high speed and the wobble mode at low speed. Several experimental tests have been carried out in the same speed range and a good correlation between simulations and tests has been found. The variation of some important vehicle parameters has been investigated; in particular, tests were repeated for different values of the rear-frame inertia, the rear-chassis stiffness, the front-tire characteristics, the normal trail, and the steer inertia...|$|R
50|$|CFRP bicycle frames weigh {{less than}} one of steel, aluminum, or {{titanium}} for the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible <b>frames</b> for <b>rider</b> comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.|$|R
