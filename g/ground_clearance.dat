5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler crank arm, an improved track tensioner and increased <b>ground</b> <b>clearance.</b> Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of projectiles at Mach 0. 9, 1. 1, and 1. 2 when {{in close proximity}} to a surface were investigated using a synergy of live-range test firings, wind-tunnel experiments, and computational fluid dynamics simulations; the latter provided the majority of the insight into the problem. Building on work that previously indicated significant ground influence for a projectile at Mach 2. 4 due to shock reflections, a similar projectile was investigated for <b>ground</b> <b>clearances</b> of height-to-diameter ratios from 0. 25 to 8. It was found that at Mach 0. 9 the projectile’s drag, normal force, and pitching moment coefficients changed predictably, and with significant increasing magnitude below h/d = 2. Drag increased, a strong normal (suction) force acting toward the ground developed with increasing strength of the shock developing on the lower side of the projectile, and a nose-up pitching tendency was established. At the supersonic Mach numbers, the ground influence was present at higher <b>ground</b> <b>clearances,</b> and influential shock reflections occurred; at high clearances, the reflected shock increased the pressure on the lower side, and at low clearances (h/d 3 ̆c 1), the reflecting expansion waves lowered the pressure to produce a pronounced negative normal force. At the lowest investigated clearances, drag was approximately 30...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} rotors in forward flight within ground effect {{showed that the}} ground-induced {{interference}} is an upwash {{and a decrease in}} forward velocity. The interference velocities are large, oppose the normal flow through the rotor, and have large effects on the induced efficiency.

This paper is posted on this site with permission from SAE International, and is for viewing only. Further use or distribution of this paper is not permitted without permission from SAE. In this paper the effects of a rough underbody on the rear wake structure of a simplified squareback model (the Windsor model) is investigated using balance measurements, base pressure measurements and two and three component planar PIV. The work forms part of a larger study to develop understanding of the mechanisms that influence overall base pressure and hence the resulting aerodynamic drag. In the work reported in this paper the impact of a rough underbody on the base pressure and wake flow structures is quantified at three different <b>ground</b> <b>clearances.</b> The underbody roughness has been created through the addition of five roughness strips to the underbody of the model and the effects on the wake at <b>ground</b> <b>clearances</b> of 10. 3 %, 17. 3 % and 24. 2 % of the model height are assessed. All work has been carried out in the Loughborough University Large Wind Tunnel with a scale model giving a blockage ratio of 4. 4 % for a smooth under-body or 4. 5 % with the maximum thickness roughness strips. The tests are conducted with a fixed ground plane. Results are presented for the base pressure distribution and these are compared against the stream-wise PIV results. This work demonstrates the need for rough underbody structures to be considered during base pressure investigations before any model scale work is conducted due to their influence on the wake structures.

Beginning with the block 22 aircraft, the original narrow-chorded Curtiss propeller was replaced by propellers with larger blades, the Evansville plant switching to a new Curtiss propeller with a diameter of 13ft (3.96m) and the Long Island plant using a Hamilton Standard propeller with a diameter of 13ft 2in (4.01m). With the bigger propellers having barely 6in (152mm) of <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> Thunderbolt pilots {{had to learn to}} be careful on takeoffs to keep the tail down until they obtained adequate <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> and on landings to flare the aircraft properly.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} study {{of the influence of}} wing span has been conducted for an inverted wing with endplates in ground effect. Aerodynamic coefficients were determined for different spans at different <b>ground</b> <b>clearances,</b> highlighting a trend for shorter spans to delay the onset of both separation and resulting loss of negative lift. The vortices at the wing endplates were not observed to change significantly in terms of strength and size; thus, at shorter spans, their influence over a larger percentage of the wing helped the flow stay attached and reduced the severity of the adverse pressure gradient which invokes separation at greater spans. Consequently, it was shown that, compared to a large-span wing, a wing with a shorter span may have a lower lift coefficient but can operate closer to the ground before performance is adversely affected. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGlobal effects {{caused by}} the {{detonation}} of an IED near a military vehicle induce subsequent severe acceleration effects on the vehicle occupants. Two concepts to minimize these global effects were developed, {{with the help of}} a combined method based on a scaled experimental technology and numerical simulations. The first concept consists in the optimization of the vehicle shape to reduce the momentum transfer and thus the occupant loading. Three scaled V-shaped vehicles with different <b>ground</b> <b>clearances</b> were built and compared to a reference vehicle equipped with a flat floor. The second concept, called dynamic impulse compensation (DIC), is based on a momentum compensation technique. The principal possibility of this concept was demonstrated on a scaled vehicle.

This paper used steady and unsteady computation methods to research the flow field around the equipment with slider at different locations and with different <b>ground</b> <b>clearances.</b> The numerical results suggest that locations of the slider have no effect on the flow field distribution. Moreover, when the equipment is far away from the ground, local velocity is 99 % of the inflow velocity at X=− 0. 5 m in front of the equipment, causing a 1 % error. So a probe with a length of 0. 5 m is needed for ensuring the experiment of 1 % accuracy. And with the equipment moving near the ground, ground effects intensify its interference so that a longer probe is needed to achieve the same error...|$|R

As the scale was reduced, the increasing peak local Mach number between the wing and the ground resulted in a higher propensity of the flow to separate towards the trailing edge, and for incompressible or full-scale CFD to underestimate the lift and drag coefficients by an ever-increasing margin. The lower vortex path was less affected. The results suggest that compressible CFD of a scale experiment ought to be conducted at the same Reynolds number and Mach number as the tunnel test for the best possible correlation at free-stream Mach numbers beyond 0. 15. 1 page(s...|$|R
