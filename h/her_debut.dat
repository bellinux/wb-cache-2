5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from <b>her</b> <b>debut.</b> Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of <b>her</b> <b>debut</b> effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as <b>her</b> <b>debut</b> album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E
