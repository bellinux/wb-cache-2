But even for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Logging-while-drilling (LWD) {{borehole}} sensors {{are used}} to provide real-time resistivity data of adjacent Earth formations for hydrocarbon exploration. This allows for an proactive adjustment of the dipping angle and azimuth direction of the drill, and hence geosteering capabilities. The analysis of borehole eccentricity effects on LWD sensor response in full 3 × 3 anisotropic Earth formations is important for correct data interpretation in deviated or horizontal wells. In this paper, we present a cylindrical-grid finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model to tackle this problem. The grid is aligned to the sensor axis to avoid staircasing error in the sensor geometry, but in general misaligned to the (eccentered) borehole/formation interface. A locally-conformal discretization is used to compute effective conductivity tensors of partially-filled grid cells at those interfaces, involving an isotropic medium (borehole) and a full 3 × 3 anisotropic medium in general (<b>dipped</b> <b>Earth</b> formation). The numerical model is used to compute the response of eccentered LWD sensors in layered Earth formations with anisotropic dipping beds.

50|$|Beanstalks and {{rotovators}} {{are currently}} {{limited by the}} strengths of available materials. Although ultra-high strength plastic fibers (Kevlar and Spectra) permit rotovators to pluck masses {{from the surface of}} the Moon and Mars, a rotovator from these materials cannot lift {{from the surface of the}} Earth. In theory, high flying, supersonic (or hypersonic) aircraft could deliver a payload to a rotovator that <b>dipped</b> into <b>Earth's</b> upper atmosphere briefly at predictable locations throughout the tropic (and temperate) zone of Earth. As of May 2013, all mechanical tethers (orbital and elevators) are on hold until stronger materials are available.|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} open country, wide and high. They talked and bounded on, Jude cutting {{from a little}} covert a long {{walking-stick}} for Sue as tall as herself, with a great crook, which made {{her look like a}} shepherdess. About half-way on their journey they crossed a main road running due east and west--the old road from London to Land's End. They paused, and looked up and down it for a moment, and remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively thoroughfare, while the wind <b>dipped</b> to <b>earth</b> and scooped straws and hay-stems from the ground.|$|R
50|$|This four-storey {{gatehouse}} is {{the tallest}} and most elaborate of the four, and {{was built in}} the early 14th century. It was intended as a self-contained fort, and each floor is capable of being defended separately. The current gatehouse was built to replace a 12th-century gate known as Munecagate, which stood 100 yd to the north-west, {{on the site of the}} Roman gate porta decumana - that location is indicated by a slight <b>dip</b> in the <b>earth</b> rampart. Today, Monk Bar houses a museum called the Richard III Experience at Monk Bar and retains its portcullis in working order.|$|R
60|$|They {{laid him}} down in a sandy chamber strewn with flowers. And, bowing many times, their heads betwixt their rather bandy legs, they left him. When they were gone, Nod wriggled softly up and looked about him. The chamber was round and caved, and on the walls were still visible the marks of the Minimuls' hands and scoops which had {{hollowed}} it out. Through the roof a rugged root pierced, crossed over, and <b>dipped</b> into the <b>earth</b> again. The candle-worms cast a gentle sheen on the golden sanded walls. Hung from the roof were strings of dried flowers, shedding so heavy and languid a smell in the narrow chamber that Nod's drowsy eyelids soon began to droop. His bright eyes glanced like fireflies, darting to and fro with his thoughts. But the odour of the flowers soon soothed them all to rest. Nod fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} day he crossed, and {{the tracks of}} Wildfire were still wet on the sand-bars. The stallion was slowing down. Slone saw him, limping along, not far in advance. There was a ten-mile stretch of level ground, blown hard as rock, from which the sustenance had been bleached, for not a spear of grass grew there. And following that was a tortuous passage through a weird region of clay dunes, blue and violet and heliotrope and lavender, all worn smooth by rain and wind. Wildfire favored the soft ground now. He had deviated from his straight course. And he was partial to washes and <b>dips</b> in the <b>earth</b> where water might have lodged. And he was not now scornful of a green-scummed water-hole with its white margin of alkali. That night Slone made camp with Wildfire in plain sight. The stallion stopped when his pursuers stopped. And he began to graze on the same stretch with Nagger. How strange this seemed to Slone! ...|$|R
40|$|The thermospheric zonal wind forms a {{fast wind}} jet at the <b>Earth’s</b> <b>dip</b> 5 equator {{instead of the}} {{geographic}} equator. This remarkable feature is re- 6 vealed in two sets of independent observations made two decades apart. One 7 is from the CHAMP satellite during the year of 2002 {{and the other is}} from 8 the DE- 2 satellite during Aug. 1981 – Feb. 1983. Both observations show 9 that this wind jet is eastward at night with speed reaching 150 ms− 1, and 10 westward around noon with speed over 75 ms− 1. These fast wind jets are 11 observed during local times of fully developed equatorial ionization anomaly 12 (EIA). On the other hand, a channel of slow wind is found on the dip equa- 13 tor during the period of 05 – 08 MLT, which corresponds to local times before 14 the EIA develops. These features strongly suggest the ion drag being the 15 principle cause for shifting the wind jet from the geographic equator to the 16 dip equator. 1...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{solution}} coating {{technique has}} emerged as a promising economically viable process for earth abundant chalcogenide absorber materials for photovoltaic applications. Here, direct ethanol based <b>dip</b> coating of <b>earth</b> abundant Cu 2 NiSnS 4 (CNTS) films on soda lime glass (SLG), molybdenum coated glass (Mo), and fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) substrates is investigated. The structural and morphological properties of pre-annealed and sulfurized CNTS films coated on SLG, FTO, and Mo substrates are reported. The influence of dipping cycles on composition and optoelectronic properties of preannealed and sulfurized CNTS films deposited on SLG substrate is presented. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis reveal how changes in thickness and elemental composition affect morphology and optoelectronic properties. The obtained absorption coefficient, optical bandgap, resistivity and mobility of pre -annealed and sulfurized films are found to be 104 cm(- 1), 1. 5 eV, 0. 48 cm, 3. 4 cm(2) /Vs and 104 cm(- 1), 1. 29 eV, 0. 14 Omega cm, 11. 0 cm(2) /Vs, respectively. These properties are well suited for photovoltaic applications and lead {{to the conclusion that the}} direct ethanol based dip coating can be an alternative economically viable process for the fabrication of earth abundant CNTS absorber layers for thin film solar cells.

40|$|The {{equatorial}} {{mass density}} anomaly (EMA) is an anomalous latitudinal {{distribution of the}} atmospheric mass density, with its equinox configuration consisting of a density trough near the <b>Earth's</b> <b>dip</b> equator flanked by density crests around ± 25 ° dip latitude. As a novel feature, this study reveals a pronounced 4 -peak longitudinal pattern of the EMA, which is in reminiscence of the wave- 4 like structure in the neutral wind and the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). It is found that the wave- 4 modulation in the EMA trough region is in phase with that in the EMA crest region, {{in contrast to the}} 180 ° phase reversal for the case of EIA. This difference strongly suggest that although the latitudinal structure of the EMA is principally caused by the EIA via ion drag, its wave- 4 pattern likely arises from different sources. The direct penetration of the non-migrating diurnal tides DE 3 to the F-region height or thermal budget modulation by the composition NO at lower thermosphere are discussed as plausible candidates. Our results reveal a 4 -hour phase lag between the wave- 4 patterns in neutral density and wind, and a 2 % peak-to-peak amplitude of the neutral density wave- 4 pattern. These results find good agreements with theoretical predictions based on direct penetration of the DE 3 to F-regions heights, hence strongly support this mechanism. Our observations thus add further evidences for the influence of tropical deep convection on the thermospheric dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Above the Atlantic Ocean, off {{the coast}} of Brazil, there is a <b>dip</b> in the <b>Earth</b> s {{surrounding}} magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly. Here, space radiation can reach into Earth s upper atmosphere to interfere with the functioning of satellites, aircraft, and even the International Space Station. "The South Atlantic Anomaly is a hot spot of radiation that the space station goes through at a certain point in orbit," Miria Finckenor, a physicist at Marshall Space Flight Center, describes, "If there s {{going to be a problem}} with the electronics, 90 percent of that time, it is going to be in that spot. " Space radiation can cause physical damage to microchips and can actually change the software commands in computers. When high-energy particles penetrate a satellite or other spacecraft, the electrical components can absorb the energy and temporarily switch off. If the energy is high enough, it can cause the device to enter a hung state, which can only be addressed by restarting the system. When space radiation affects the operational status of microprocessors, the occurrence is called single event functional interrupt (SEFI). SEFI happens not only to the computers onboard spacecraft in Earth orbit, but to the computers on spacecraft throughout the solar system. "One of the Mars rovers had this problem in the radiation environment and was rebooting itself several times a day. On one occasion, it rebooted 40 times in one day," Finckenor says. "It s hard to obtain any data when you have to constantly reboot and start over. ...|$|R
60|$|The {{expanse of}} open plain {{that we now}} beheld {{stretched}} away uninterruptedly on the right hand, {{as far as the}} distant hills. Towards the left, the view was broken and varied by some rough stone walls, a narrow road, and a <b>dip</b> in the <b>earth</b> beyond. Wherever we looked, far or near, we saw masses of granite of all shapes and sizes, heaped irregularly on the ground among dark clusters of heath. An old furze-cutter was the only human figure that appeared on the desolate scene. Approaching him to ask our way to St. Cleer's Well--no signs of which could be discerned on the wilderness before us--we found the old fellow, though he was eighty years of age, working away with all the vigour of youth. On this wild moor he had lived and laboured from childhood; and he began to talk proudly of its great length and breadth, and of the wonderful sights that were to be seen on different parts of it, the moment we addressed him. He described to us, in his own homely forcible way, the awful storms that he had beheld, the fearful rattling and roaring of thunder over the great unsheltered plain before us--the hail and sleet driven so fiercely before the hurricane, that a man was half-blinded if he turned his face towards it for a moment--the forked lightning shooting from pitch-dark clouds, leaping and running fearfully over the level ground, blackening, splitting, tearing from their places the stoutest rocks on the moor. Three masses of granite lay heaped together near the spot where we had halted--the furze-cutter pointed to them with his bill-hook, and told us that what we now looked on was once one great rock, which he had seen riven in an instant by the lightning into the fragmentary form that it now presented. If we mounted the highest of these three masses, he declared that we might find out our own way to St. Cleer's Well by merely looking around us. We followed his directions. Towards the east, far away over the magnificent sweep of moorland, and on the slope of the hill that bounded it, appeared the tall chimneys and engine-houses of the Great Caraton Copper Mine--the only objects raised by the hand of man that were to be seen on this part of the view. Towards the west, much nearer at hand, four grey turrets were just visible beyond some rising ground. These turrets belonged to the tower of St. Cleer's Church, and the Well was close by it.|$|R
