40|$|Epithelial-mesenchymal {{interactions}} {{are central to}} the development of skin and skin appendages in vertebrates. These interactions continue throughout adult life and underpin the cyclic growth and loss of hair in mammals. While the molecular basis of such {{interactions are}} being gradually uncovered, at the cellular level many questions remain unanswered. For example, the localisation and role of hair follicle epithelial stem cells remains a subject of debate, as does the function of the dermal sheath component. In embryonic appendage development there is strong evidence for common signalling mechanisms, but the degree to which epithelial-mesenchymal communication diverges in different adult appendages remains as yet undiscovered. I have studied the replicative abilities of germinative epidermal (GE) cells of the rat vibrissa follicle by single and repeated plucking of fibres from individual follicles. In both cases, the cellular events following fibre removal were scrutinised at intervals up to 9 days using histology, and cell proliferation and cell death markers. Follicles that were repeatedly plucked had their growing hairs measured at regular intervals. By analysing cell proliferation patterns I found that the new regenerated epidermal matrix came from residual GE cells left in the follicle base - after both single and repeated <b>depilations.</b> Indeed plucking appeared to cause an initial inhibition of proliferative activity in the follicle upper outer root sheath, the other candidate region for supplying a new matrix. Length measurements of the regenerated hairs demonstrated that the repeatedly plucked follicles produced total cumulative lengths of fibre between 60 and 265 % longer than expected, as determined by measuring the original club fibre lengths. In vivo amputation of plucked follicles demonstrated that the residual GE cells have the ability to regenerate a new matrix and new fibre without any contribution from cells from the upper region of the follicle. These studies, along with in vitro observations of prolonged replicative abilities of bulb cells suggest that the GE cells have a proliferative capacity which is beyond that of one cycle. This raises the possibility that GE cells are not transient amplifying cells with limited proliferative potential and strongly suggests that the duration of anagen cannot be attributed to the replicative limitations of the GE cells. The behaviour and interactive abilities of dermal cells isolated from three different skin appendages (rat vibrissa follicle, rat claw unit, and pigeon feather follicle) were characterised by cell culture, immunohistochemistry and dermal-epidermal recombinations. Dermal cells from all the above appendages demonstrated common aggregation properties in culture and all expressed a-smooth muscle actin. When recombined with epidermal cells and implanted onto host rats, dermal sheath cells from the lower part of vibrissa follicles produced a robust skin-like structure with a norma...|$|R

50|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestation of}} infestation with psoroptic mites is usually called mange and sometimes scabies, but the skin disease of sheep caused by Psoroptes ovis is often {{known locally as}} sheep scab. This species may affect its hosts severely enough to reduce their gain in weight. Costs to farmers of controlling sheep-scab in Britain were at £8 million (US$12 million) annually in 2005. Transmission between hosts is readily accomplished by contagion during flocking contact and also on fomites such as scraps of sheep's wool because these relatively large and robust mites can survive for one to two weeks off their host. Psoroptes ovis infests the superficial layers of the skin. Irritation of the outer skin by the mite's mouthparts and saliva results in a complex form of cutaneous hypersensitivity and inflammatory exudation of serum and fresh cells. The mites feed on this moist exudate. The skin loses its hair (<b>depilation)</b> at the sites of infestation {{and this may be}} extensive. As a result of the movement of the mites into areas of fresh skin, large scabs accumulate on the raw skin left behind. The mites cause intense pruritus (itching). In cases of heavy infestations, the host grooms compulsively, aggravating the <b>depilation,</b> and it may become mentally distressed. Psoroptes ovis infests sheep worldwide and can be a serious welfare and animal-production problem for sheep farmers.Infestations of cattle with mites of the similar genus Chorioptes, in combination with Sarcoptes mite infestation, has been shown to cause a failure to gain body weight by 15.5 kg to 37.2 kg over a two-month period compared to cattle without the mites.|$|E
50|$|Comic sources {{describe}} the abuse and humiliation of those guilty of moicheia, including {{a scene in}} the Clouds where Aristophanes refers to an adulterer being punished by the insertion of a radish into his anus. Other comic punishments for adulterers include the removal of pubic hair. Kapparis has argued that both of these punishments were intended to humiliate the adulterer by feminising them, as <b>depilation</b> was a standard part of a female beauty regimen in Classical Athens, and being penetrated was associated with femininity. The historian David Cohen has questioned the idea that these comic forms of abuse were carried out in reality, but Konstantinos Kapparis and Christopher Carey {{have argued that the}} reason that these jokes had such longevity in comedy was precisely because they were a reflection of reality.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Polypropylene drums permitted the routine commercial {{use of a}} range of highly corrosive chemicals in the tanning industry, for processes such as <b>depilation</b> and bleaching. In spite of the cheapness of the processes the chemicals they require are too aggressive for most practical choices of metal drums. ==Polypropylene drums for aggressive chemical processes== Polypropylene is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with high bonding strength, tough, stable, elastic, hard and highly abrasion- and impact-resistant. Because of its chemical and physical molecular structure, solid masses of polypropylene are highly resistant {{to a wide range of}} aggressive chemicals including aqueous solutions of salts, acids and alkalis.Applying these characteristics to the demands of the tannery, professor Mario Serrini invented the first polypropylene drum in the 1990s and subsequently he exploited the attributes of the material to refine the technical advantages and performance of the tanning process.|$|E
5000|$|Infestation of {{the outer}} skin is {{typically}} caused by psoroptic mites. Psoroptes ovis is an example, it infests sheep and cattle. Other common psoroptic mites are in the genera Chorioptes and Otodectes. Psoroptic mites as adults are just large enough to see {{with the naked eye}} and can crawl rapidly using long legs. Psoroptes ovis infests the superficial layers of the skin, among the dead cells of the stratum corneum. Irritation {{of the outer}} skin by the mite's mouthparts and saliva results in cutaneous hypersensitivity and inflammatory exudation of serum and fresh cells. The mites feed on this exudate. The skin loses its hair at the sites of infestation and large flakes of dried serum and cells accumulate.

Psoroptes ovis infests sheep worldwide and can be a serious welfare and animal production problem, mainly for sheep, but also cattle. Psoroptes cuniculi infests rabbits, mainly on their outer ear. Chorioptes bovis infestations are found on cattle, sheep and horses but do not cause the severe reactions associated with Psoroptes mites. Otedectes cynotis infestations on the outer ear of dogs are a common problem.|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of lambskins {{plays an important}} role in the New Zealand meat industry. The use of enzyme dewooling offers considerable advantages over the conventional <b>depilation</b> method which generates unpleasant working conditions and poses product quality risks when not properly handled. Prior to this work it was unclear from the literature why the practice of enzymatic <b>depilation</b> had not generally been adopted by industry. The aim of this work was to determine the problems associated with enzymatic <b>depilation</b> and provide a mechanistic understanding of the dewooling and damaging processes of enzyme <b>depilation</b> to provide underpinning knowledge for the design of a successful enzymatic <b>depilation</b> system. It was found that variability in <b>depilation</b> between different regions of the skin resulted in either over exposure of the skin to the enzyme regent and subsequent damage or underexposure of the skin to the enzyme reagent and incomplete <b>depilation.</b> Two approaches were taken in the work: Firstly an attempt was made for the first time to understand the variability in enzymatic <b>depilation</b> so that the variability observed in enzymatic <b>depilation</b> could potentially be reduced, thereby allowing a complete <b>depilation</b> process with no overexposure. Secondly an investigation was made for the first time to understand the cause of damage to skins during the process of enzymatic <b>depilation</b> so that the enzyme <b>depilation</b> process could potentially be modified to avoid damage. Experimental work characterising the time course of <b>depilation</b> and damage development was carried out and compared with the variation of physical properties across the skin. Correlations between <b>depilation</b> and physical properties such as thickness, grease content and follicle density were found. Reduction in the variability of these properties would likely improve the evenness of <b>depilation</b> but would not reduce it enough to eliminate damage due to over exposure. A range of techniques including: immunohistology, 2 -dimensional electrophoresis, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation, and atomic force microscopy were used to probe the structural and biochemical mechanism of enzyme <b>depilation</b> and damage. In this way it was found that the removal of minor collagen components were the likely cause of damage observed. In particular the removal of collagen VI was associated with a disruption of the smooth mesh of fine collagen fibres observed at the surface of the leather. The key requirement identified for a successful enzyme <b>depilation</b> system was the use of a broad spectrum protease which has no activity against collagen VI. The means to select a protease with these attributes was also developed by adopting a micro <b>depilation</b> assay incorporating immunohistology. This knowledge will enable the future development of non damaging enzyme depilatory reagents that could revolutionise the industry...|$|E
