5|$|Prions are {{proteins}} {{of particular}} amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein {{with the same}} amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> is Protein→Protein.|$|E

By adapting to online strategies, firms are blessed (or doomed) with {{a plethora of}} new business models. The <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> created in the process poses both op-portunities and challenges for marketers. On one hand, <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> captured online are usually easier to be stored and processed, thus empowering firms to be better informed about the consumers or the market itself.

My dissertation studies the marketing implications of these <b>information</b> <b>flows.</b> Broad as the re-search question is, my dissertation focuses on specific market settings.

For ex- ample, the MAC protection must allow some <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> between two virtual machines while preventing other <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> {{between those two}} machines. For solving these problems, the virtual environment must guarantee an in-depth protection {{in order to control}} the <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> that starts in a Virtual Machine (vm) and finishes in another one. In contrast with existing MAC approaches, PIGA-Virt is a MAC protec- tion controlling the different levels of a virtual system. It eases the man- agement of the required security objectives. The PIGA-Virt approach guarantees the required security objectives while controlling efficiently the <b>information</b> <b>flows.</b> PIGA-Virt supports a large range of predefined protection canvas whose efficiency has been demonstrated during the ANR Sec&Si 1 security challenge. The paper shows how the PIGA-Virt approach guarantees advanced confidentiality and integrity properties by controlling complex combinations of transitive <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> passing through intermediate resources. As far as we know, PIGA-Virt is the first operational solution providing in-depth MAC protection, addressing ad- vanced security requirements and controlling efficiently <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> inside and between virtual machines.

25|$|Esperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no {{grammatical}} gender, {{and simple}} verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, {{of which the}} indicative has three tenses, and are derived for several aspects, but {{do not agree with}} the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs to show the destination of a motion, or to replace certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of ethical concerns regarding the deployment of complex public sector IT systems and the <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> they instigate. The paper aims to reveal how different views on IT and IT-enabled <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> allow us to see differently their social implications and to construe different ethical questions. This is achieved by i) defining two opposing views on IT-enabled <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> as 'intermediaries' and 'mediators'; ii) by analysing the controversial case of My School - a web portal that provides performance data of 9, 500 Australian schools - that introduces new <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> in the education sector; and iii) by revealing and explaining how some unintended negative social implications emerge and how the articulation of ethical concerns depends on the view on My School-enabled <b>information</b> <b>flows.</b> The paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications, with particular emphasis on responsibilities of all involved, setting up foundations for an important area of future IS research.

Portions of these reports, say those over Kent, {{would be sent to}} 11 Group, while others, the attack on RAF Driffield for instance, would only be relayed to 13 Group. In turn, 11 Group's operations room would relay only those tracks of interest down to the sectors, filtering out tracks that were out of their range, or being handled by other sectors. Finally, the sector operators only had to relay information to the pilots that actually had an effect on their flight– data about other formations was not relayed, freeing the radio time.|$|E

25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
