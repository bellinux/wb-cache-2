25|$|In the 1980s <b>electronic</b> <b>typewriters</b> {{and later}} {{personal}} computers provided people in China and Japan {{an alternative to}} writing by hand. With {{the advent of the}} World Wide Web in 1991 and the subsequent widespread use of email, internet chat, and discussion forums, people began using computers {{to communicate with each other}} in Chinese and Japanese. Today, increased computer usage and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand. In a 2010 survey by Dayang Net, 43 percent of respondents said they use the computer all the time for their jobs and 43 percent said that they only write out characters by hand when filling out forms or writing their signature.|$|E

2500|$|The final major {{development}} of the typewriter was the [...] "electronic" [...] typewriter. Most of these replaced the typeball with a plastic or metal daisy wheel mechanism (a disk with the letters molded on the outside edge of the [...] "petals"). The daisy wheel concept first emerged in printers developed by Diablo Systems in the 1970s. [...] In 1981, Xerox Corporation, who by then had bought Diablo Systems, introduced a line of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Typewriters</b> incorporating this technology (the Memorywriter product line). For a time, these products were quite successful as their daisy-wheel mechanism was much simpler and cheaper than either typebar or Selectric mechanisms, and their electronic memory and display allowed the user to easily see errors and correct them before they were actually printed. [...] One problem with the plastic daisy wheel {{was that they were}} not always durable. [...] To solve this problem, more durable metal daisy wheels were made available (but at a slightly higher price).|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s IBM {{introduced}} a Selectric III {{and several other}} Selectric models, some of them word processors or typesetters instead of typewriters, but by {{then the rest of}} the industry had caught up with the trend, and IBM's new models did not dominate the market the way the first Selectric had. This was to be expected, as by the late 1970s the Selectric typewriter's dominance was under assault from both 35-45 character per second proportional-spacing <b>electronic</b> <b>typewriters</b> with inbuilt memory (e.g. the 800 from Xerox based on Diablo's [...] "daisywheels" [...] and from OEMs of Qume who had a similar printwheel technology) and CRT-based systems from AES, Lexitron, Vydek, Wang and Xerox (see the Word Processor article for further details of these brands). In addition, IBM had already (c. 1977) brought to market the CRT-based Office System/6 (from Office Products Division) and 5520 [...] (from IBM General Systems Division (GSD)) both of which used the new 6640 inkjet printer capable of 96 characters per second with two paper trays and sophisticated envelope handling, and was about to introduce Qume-based printers for the existing System/6 range and the new Displaywriter launched in June 1980 and described by IBM as [...] "not your father's Selectric." ...|$|E

50|$|Daisy wheel {{printing}} is {{an impact}} printing technology invented in 1969 by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems. It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters {{such as the}} IBM Selectric, but {{two to three times}} faster. Daisy wheel printing was used in <b>electronic</b> <b>typewriters,</b> word processors and computers from 1972. The daisy wheel is considered to be so named because of its resemblance to the daisy flower.|$|E
50|$|By 1980 daisy wheel {{printers}} {{had become}} the dominant technology for high-quality text printing. Dot-matrix impact, thermal, or line printers were used where higher speed or image printing were required and poor print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers - in particular laser printers - that could print any characters or graphics, rather than being restricted to a limited character set, became able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy wheel technology is now found only in some <b>electronic</b> <b>typewriters.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{pinnacle}} {{of this kind}} of technology was the IBM <b>Electronic</b> <b>Typewriter</b> series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric ink ribbons, [...] or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons. [...] This latter technology actually lifted the carbon film forming a typed letter, leaving nothing more than a flattened depression in the surface of the paper, with the advantage that no color matching of the paper was needed.|$|R
