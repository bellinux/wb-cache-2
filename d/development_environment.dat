5|$|Plan 9 proponents and {{developers}} {{claim that the}} problems hindering its adoption have been solved, that its original goals as a distributed system, <b>development</b> <b>environment,</b> and research platform have been met, and that it enjoys moderate but growing popularity. Inferno, through its hosted capabilities, has been a vehicle for bringing Plan 9 technologies to other systems as a hosted part of heterogeneous computing grids.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools {{is a game}} engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for elements such as graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems of Crystal Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making cross-platform production more feasible. The idea for the engine sprang from Square Enix's desire to have a unified game <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
5|$|Like the iPhone, {{with which}} it shares a <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> the iPad only runs its own {{software}}, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices. The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen. Developers may also create or modify apps {{to take advantage of}} the iPad's features, and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016. Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad. The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} early 2014, and {{prompted}} skepticism from both Square Enix staff and its prospective platform managers, {{who were more}} used to the dominant 2D-based mobile games. One of the problems cited by project leader Naoki Hamaguchi was creating realistic facial expressions equivalent to those used in the 2013 film Frozen. For development, the team used the Unity game engine. The development team built {{a relationship with the}} team at Unity Technologies very early in the development of Unity 5 and this allowed them to have their opinions included in the engine. Despite being dependent on the Unity 5 engine, the team also customised the game editor portion themselves. The team needed to take differences between different phone models into account to allow high performance. To help with development and overcome potential difficulties handling the Unity engine, a special <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> and structure was created. The team used physically based rendering to create realistic lighting and environmental effects. The budget was far lower than graphically equivalent console titles, so the team were reluctant to buy in helping tools and had restrictions on staff numbers: one person was working on all the game's backgrounds, while three were in charge of character designs. Using experience from the development of Final Fantasy XIII, the team were able to create high-end graphics within mobile restrictions.|$|E
