5|$|The USB Implementers Forum {{is working}} on a {{wireless}} networking standard based on the USB protocol. Wireless USB is a cable-replacement technology, and uses ultra-wideband wireless technology for <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> of up to 480Mbit/s.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The goal was to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> for external devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure that}} there are enough signal {{transitions}} for clock recovery {{to occur in the}} bitstream, a bit stuffing technique is applied to the data stream: an extra 0bit is insert into the data stream after any occurrence of six consecutive 1bits. (Thus ensuring that there is a 0bit to cause a transmission state transition.) Seven consecutively received 1bits are always an error. For USB3.0, additional data transmission encoding is used to handle the higher <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> required.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high <b>data</b> <b>rates,</b> thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E

INTRODUCTION Scalability, which includes <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> scalability, spatial resolution scalability and temporal resolution scalability, has become a very important issue in video coding algorithms. In this paper, we consider <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> scalability, which means that from a single compressed bit stream, any target <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> can be achieved. Usually, the visual quality of a decoded video sequence is related to the <b>data</b> <b>rate,</b> e. g. at a low <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> a decoded video sequence has a poor visual quality. However, a constant <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> does not necessarily imply a stable visual quality. Often the visual quality of a decoded video seq [...] ...|$|R

25|$|ANICS {{service is}} {{provided}} by FAA-owned satellite earth stations and leased transponders on two communications satellites. NAS facilities are connected to ASTI demarcation points through access circuits. These access circuits may be implemented by a copper or fiber optic cable, microwave radio, or leased services. Communications interfaces provide for Voice Grade (VG) services (VG1, VG2, VG3, VG5, VG6, VG7, VG8, VG10) and for digital services for <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> from 300 bit/s to 1.544 Mbit/s.|$|E
25|$|The higher speed {{rates are}} {{achieved}} {{by using a}} two-lane low voltage (0.4V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156MB/s. In full duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher <b>data</b> <b>rates,</b> the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI).|$|E
25|$|A normal VCD is encoded to MPEG-1 at a {{constant}} bit rate (CBR), so all scenes are required to use exactly the same data rate, regardless of complexity. However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.|$|E
