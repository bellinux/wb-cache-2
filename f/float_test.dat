50|$|The lung <b>float</b> <b>test,</b> {{also called}} the {{hydrostatic}} test or docimasia, is a controversial autopsy procedure used in determining whether lungs have undergone respiration. It has historically been employed in cases of suspected infanticide to help {{determine whether or not}} an infant was stillborn. In the test, lungs that float in water are thought to have been aerated, while those that sink are presumed to indicate an absence of air.|$|E
50|$|The defense {{pathologist}} {{testified that}} the 23- or 24-week fetus was stillborn, with lungs insufficiently developed to breathe, while the prosecution pathologist {{testified that the}} fetus was at 25 to 30 weeks and was born alive. The prosecutors used a widely discredited lung <b>float</b> <b>test</b> {{to determine whether the}} fetus took a breath after birth. The procedure tests the buoyancy of the lungs in the belief that lungs that float suggest that the fetus took a breath, and the lungs in this case did float. Forensic experts discredit the use of such a test in criminal proceedings {{because of the number of}} false positives on record. The jury in Patel's case determined the fetus had been alive and found Patel guilty of child neglect.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we compare the {{properties}} {{and the performance of}} three different carbonaceous materials, namely activated carbon, carbon black and graphene based nanoplatelets, as active materials for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The aim of this investigation is to contribute to the assessment of the advantages and limits related to the use of alternative active carbonaceous materials for EDLCs, with particular regard to carbon blacks. The results of this investigation indicate carbon black as a very promising candidate for the realization of high performance EDLCs, able to display high energy and high power. However, <b>float</b> <b>test</b> for 500 h at 2. 7 V have shown strong capacitance fade for carbon black based EDLCs. Post-mortem SEM analysis revealed cracks in the electrode surface, which could be related to the breakage of carbon black agglomerates during <b>float</b> <b>test,</b> which then in turn may be the reason of the strong capacitance fade. Overcoming this issue will be the next challenging step {{in order to be able}} to take advantage of the promising characteristics of this carbon black for longer time periods...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{cellulose}} {{has recently}} emerged as potential candidate for replacing fluorinated polymers (e. g. PVdF) binders in electrochemi-cal double layer capacitors (EDLC) and lithium-ion batteries. In the present work it is demonstrated that, among the advantages offered by its natural origin, cellulose fibers enables superior performance retention under <b>float</b> <b>test</b> at high voltage compared ot PVdF. Specif-ically, {{the performance of}} cellulose-based EDLCs with neat N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (PYR 14 TFSI) electrolyte are investigated upon prolonged float voltage tests at 3. 7 V. After 750 hours, cellulose-based EDLC soffered capacitance retention of 52. 7 % with respect to only 7. 5 % provided by the PVdF-based ones. For both kinds of devices, post-mortem analysis carried out on the electrolytes suggests a partial decomposition of the electrolyte, leading, at some extent, to the passivation/clogging of the electrode. Nevertheless, the main aging mechanisms seem to concern the electrodes ’ mechanical and chemical stability. PVdF binder rapidly degrades, thus causing dramatic capacitance losses, especially at the negative electrode. On the contrary, cellulose does not show any particular evidence of failures and the electrode morphology after 750 hours float voltage resembles that of the pristine electrode...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transfer}} of swimming skills from indoor, flat, calm conditions to outdoor, wavy, unsteady conditions. The aim of the current {{study was to examine the}} differences in swimming, floating, and entry skills in children between calm and simulated open water conditions. Sixty-six children, 11 years of age, were tested on two occasions, once in calm water and once in simulated open water conditions. Testing consisted of a 200 m time trial, a 3 min back <b>floating</b> <b>test,</b> a diving entry, and a rolling entry. The results show an 8 % decrement in performance on the 200 m swim between calm and unsteady conditions for those who completed the 200 m under both conditions. When weaker swimmers, who only completed 50 m of the 200 m test distance were tested, the performance decrement rose to 14 %. The diving entry, the rolling entry, and the <b>floating</b> <b>test</b> had decrements of 16 %, 21 %, and 24 %, respectively.

Two methods were used for modification: the solution method and the dry coating. The obtained products were characterized using the thermal analysis (DT/TG), X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by the evaluation of <b>floating</b> <b>test.</b> Results of <b>floating</b> <b>test</b> showed that when the solution method was applied, the hydrophobicity arrived at above 99 % when the amount of stearic acid was 1. 5 %, while with the dry coating the same hydrophobicity was achieved with 3 % of stearic acid. From {{the position of the}} principal exothermic peak (> 310 °C) at DTA curves, for calcites modified with dry coating and with the solution method, it can be concluded that with both modification processes, the same active sites exist at the calcite surface onto which stearic acid may be chemisorbed.

The usage of blends of ionic liquids and organic solvents has been considered as a feasible strategy since these electrolytes combine high usable voltages and good transport properties at the same time. In this work, the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium bis{(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl}imide ([Pyrr 14][TFSI]) was mixed with two nitrile-based organic solvents, namely butyronitrile and adiponitrile, and the resulting blends were investigated regarding their usage in electrochemical double layer capacitors. Both blends have a high electrochemical stability, which was confirmed by prolonged <b>float</b> <b>tests</b> at 3. 2 V, as well as, good transport properties. In fact, the butyronitrile blend reaches a conductivity of 17. 14 mS·cm− 1 and a viscosity of 2. 46 mPa·s at 20 °C, which is better than the state-of-the-art electrolyte (1 mol·dm− 3 of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in propylene carbonate) ...|$|R
