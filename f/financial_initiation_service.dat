30|$|VM migration, {{especially}} live VM migration, {{as mentioned}} in Section II.A, {{is useful for}} delay sensitive applications for MCC. Live VM migration, a key technology in virtualization, {{is the process of}} moving a running VM from one physical host to another with minimal downtime. For live VM migration, the <b>service</b> <b>initiation</b> time is a critical factor that causes delay. <b>Service</b> <b>initiation</b> time is the time from when the MD discovers a cloudlet to the time the MD starts offloading data. Four main steps are involved for the <b>service</b> <b>initiation</b> time: bind the MD with the cloudlet, transfer the VM overlay, decompress the VM overlay, and apply the VM overlay to the base VM to launch the VM. To minimize the <b>service</b> <b>initiation</b> time, Ha, et al. [15] applied four optimization techniques (Deduplication, Bridging the Semantic Gap, Pipelining, and Early Start) to minimize the delay significantly.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} a rich body of {{empirical}} research that uses specific service offerings (e. g. product-related and customer-related services) as proxies for the extent of servitization, the results are inconsistent. We investigate service transitions from an innovation management and resource-based perspective, assessing the service transition stages through the service offering type, service innovativeness {{and the extent of}} invested internal and external resources. We use a qualitative approach based on interviews of managers from 19 energy utilities in Germany and complementary longitudinal secondary data. We identify three service transition stages: 1) <b>service</b> <b>initiation,</b> 2) <b>service</b> anchoring and (3) service extension. The findings indicate that firms concurrently experiment with different service offerings and that their services' innovativeness steadily increases during service transition. We contribute to servitization research by identifying barriers in each of the service transition stages that prevent product-centric firms from achieving a higher service transition stage. While in the <b>service</b> <b>initiation</b> stage, firms may face strategy-related barriers, these are often followed by implementation-related barriers in the service anchoring stage and market-related barriers in the service extension stage. To overcome strategy-related barriers, our results indicate that firms should balance their product-oriented and service-oriented business model and can benefit from developing a clear strategic intent with relevant service offerings. We further find that implementation-related barriers can be overcome by establishing a service-specific innovation process. To overcome market-related barriers, the findings indicate that firms should integrate customers and external partners in the service innovation ecosystemThe work described in this paper was substantially supported by the Association for Energy and Climate Protection in Schleswig-Holstein (EKSH) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to set up}} {{a natural}} {{experiment}} as action research and to develop a framework of cognitive distance of informants to improve the <b>initiation</b> of <b>service</b> encounter-based innovation. Design/methodology/approach – Natural experiment as action research in one Scandinavian case company is used. This paper includes a longitudinal study over 10 month’s duration. Findings – An organisational support system and an improved front-office innovation climate were set up which generated a new system for information gleaning. A framework of cognitive distance was induced from transcriptions of interviews and transcriptions. Research limitations/implications – Only one Scandinavian company and a limited number of informants were activated. Also, the time period only included the <b>initiation</b> phase of <b>service</b> encounter-based innovation. Practical implications – Three different strategies are suggested to respond to different types of word-of-business. Social implications – Cognitive distance is a generic concept which relates to all human interaction and communication. It can explain why it is so difficult to “get things across”.
