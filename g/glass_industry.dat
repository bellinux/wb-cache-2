5|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> in Hebron was {{established}} during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Hebron {{glass is}} an {{attraction}} for {{both domestic and}} foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement {{in the aftermath of}} the Second Intifada, industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation, under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> is in question.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the <b>glass</b> <b>industry,</b> manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E

By contrast, northern Indiana experienced an economic boom when natural gas {{was discovered in}} the 1880s, which directly contributed to {{the rapid growth of}} cities such as Gas City, Hartford City, and Muncie where a <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> developed to utilize the cheap fuel. The Indiana gas field was then the largest known in the world. The boom lasted until the early 20th century, when the gas supplies ran low. This began northern Indiana's industrialization.|$|E

25|$|The {{progress}} of the <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> (especially {{from the use of}} coal) helped to democratize the use of the glass bottle. The production of sparkling wine increased dramatically and spread to the American continent. The technique of manufacturing was industrialized and other regions were inspired but the reputation of champagne suffered. The commercial flight of champagne was a product of the industrial revolution that allowed it to be within the financial reach of the booking middle classes.|$|E
25|$|The Roman writers Statius and Martial both {{indicate}} that recycling broken glass {{was an important}} part of the <b>glass</b> <b>industry,</b> and this seems to be supported by the fact that only rarely are glass fragments of any size recovered from domestic sites of this period. In the western empire there is evidence that recycling of broken glass was frequent and extensive(cullet), and that quantities of broken glassware were concentrated at local sites prior to melting back into raw glass. Compositionally, repeated recycling is visible via elevated levels of those metals used as colourants.|$|E
25|$|Renaissance Europe {{witnessed}} {{the revitalization of}} <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the Venetian glassworkers from Murano to produce the fine glassware which {{is also known as}} cristallo. The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for window panes in the late 17th century. The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown {{in many parts of the}} world, for example, in China, Japan and the Islamic Lands.|$|E

25|$|Glasses {{with lead}} oxide content first {{appeared}} in Mesopotamia, {{the birthplace of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>industry.</b> The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from Nippur dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO. Glass is mentioned in clay tablets from the reign of Assurbanipal (668–631 BC), and a recipe for lead glaze appears in a Babylonian tablet of 1700 BC. A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud, from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.|$|E
25|$|The {{vast amounts}} of wood needed to produce glass in this way {{dictated}} that glasshouses be located in forest areas and that the woodland be managed carefully by coppicing and pollarding to maximise the wood resource and to optimise the size of wood pieces used. Even so, periodically the glasshouse would have to relocate, as the woodland was depleted. The <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> had to compete for wood supplies with other industries such as mining, and domestic demand. In sixteenth-century England, an embargo {{was placed on the}} use of wood for fuel for glassmaking. Glasshouses often were located in forests owned by the church. One of the main uses of forest glass was for ecclesiastical stained glass windows.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> was {{therefore}} {{a relatively minor}} craft during the Republican period; although, during {{the early decades of}} the 1st century AD the quantity and diversity of glass vessels available increased dramatically. This was a direct result of the massive growth of the Roman influence at the end of the Republican period, the Pax Romana that followed the decades of civil war, and the stabilisation of the state that occurred under Augustus’ rule. Still, Roman glasswares were already making their way from Western Asia (i.e. the Parthian Empire) to the Kushan Empire in Afghanistan and India and as far Han Empire of China. The first Roman glass found in China came from an early 1st-century BC tomb at Guangzhou, ostensibly via the South China Sea.|$|E

Vân Đồn and Cô Tô are island districts. There are thousands of islands on Hạ Long Bay and Bái Tử Long Bay, many of which contain caves. Besides areas of alluvial deposits, there are also white sand zones which have built up from tidal action. Some places have formed white sand mines producing materials for the <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> (Van Hai), or have developed into tourism spots (Trà Cổ, Quan Lạn, Minh Châu, Ngọc Vừng).|$|E
25|$|Glass {{manufacturing}} {{played an}} important role in the growth of Cumberland from 1880 to 1930. The Warren Glass Works Company located in South Cumberland, and the Cumberland Glass Works located at the west end of North Mechanic Street, were established in the early 1880s and would become the two major glass making firms. The industry used local coal as an economical fuel, and native pure silica sandstone in the making of the glass. At the peak of production, around 1920, well over 1,000 people were employed in the glass factories and decorating shops. The onset of the Great Depression, coupled with the destruction of seven factories by fire dealt the <b>glass</b> <b>industry</b> in Cumberland a fatal blow. Recently, however, a glass decorating business opened in the city, using some equipment from the former companies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days of the Empire, the {{technical}} proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of ground-glass paint and yellow-stain:- babies’ ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the Edwardian period are the most opulent creations of the stained <b>glass</b> <b>industry.</b> The youthful Virgin of the Annunciation, Peter the fisherman, John the itinerant preacher and Joseph the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls.|$|E
