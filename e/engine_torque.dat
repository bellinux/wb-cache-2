25|$|The aircraft, a CASA C-212~C {{registered}} N432CA, was {{put into}} service with Executive Airlines in October 1986 after it was purchased from Prinair. As {{a result of the}} impact of the crash and subsequent fire, the aircraft was destroyed. The aircraft involved in the crash had prior maintenance troubles related to <b>engine</b> <b>torque.</b> In fact, just a day before the accident, issues with the propeller blade angle were addressed by Executive's maintenance department.|$|E
25|$|Four-by-four (4×4) {{refers to}} the general class of vehicles. The first figure {{represents}} the total wheels (more precisely, axle ends), and the second, the number that are powered. Syntactically, 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. Alternatively, a 6×4 vehicle has three axles, two of which provide torque to two wheel ends each.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} X5 was an all-wheel drive vehicle, BMW chose {{from the start}} to route 62% of the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> to the rear wheels, making it feel as close as {{possible}} to the company's rear-wheel drive sedans.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the clutch}} pedal is fully released, the clutch is fully engaged {{and all of}} the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> is transferred. In this coupled state, the clutch does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|Developed {{with help}} from Ricardo, the engine redlines at 8500 rpm, however 80% of the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> is {{available}} as low as 2000 rpm. McLaren claims that the engine has the highest horsepower to [...] emission ratio of any current production engine.|$|R
25|$|BMW, {{working with}} Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental Automotive Systems, {{developed}} {{a system to}} reduce <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> to prevent loss of control and applied it {{to most of the}} BMW model line for 1992 excluding the l3 series (E30 and some E36 chassis codes) which could be ordered with the winter package, which came with a limited slip differential, heated seats and mirrors. From 1987 to 1992, Mercedes-Benz and Robert Bosch GmbH co-developed a system called Elektronisches Stabilitätsprogramm ("Electronic Stability Programme", trademarked as ESP) to control lateral slippage.|$|E
25|$|Probst {{laid out}} full {{plans for the}} Bantam prototype, known as the BRC or Bantam Reconnaissance Car, in just two days, working up a cost {{estimate}} the next. Bantam's bid was submitted, complete with blueprints, on July 22. While much of the vehicle could be assembled from off-the-shelf automotive parts, custom four-wheel drivetrain components were to be supplied by Spicer. The hand-built prototype was completed in Butler, Pennsylvania, and driven to Camp Holabird, Maryland, for Army testing September 21. The vehicle met all the Army's criteria except <b>engine</b> <b>torque.</b>|$|E
25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> and {{acceleration}} were {{increased by}} {{the introduction of}} the new fuel-injected system, with dual throttle valve and auto fast-idle systems. The engine uses SCEM cylinder plating. Suzuki said the engine developed [...] @ 4,800 rpm and 114 Nm @ 2,300 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The RS5 {{also has}} an active rear {{differential}} that can apportion power between the rear wheels to create a similar effect, or even oversteer; in normal conditions, quattro all wheel drive delivers 60% of the <b>engine’s</b> <b>torque</b> rearward and rising {{to as much as}} 85 percent depending on conditions.|$|R
50|$|The only engine {{used was}} the D13B, {{initially}} using 2 valves per cylinder with an upgrade to 4 valves as complaints {{began to be}} heard concerning less than adequate performance. A CVT transmission was offered {{to take advantage of}} the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> ability and offer strong fuel economy.|$|R
2500|$|The Lockheed design {{incorporated}} {{tricycle undercarriage}} and a bubble canopy, and featured two [...] turbosupercharged 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines fitted with counter-rotating propellers {{to eliminate the}} effect of <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> with the turbochargers positioned behind the engines, the exhaust side of the units exposed along the dorsal surfaces of the booms. Counter-rotation was achieved {{by the use of}} [...] "handed" [...] engines, which meant the crankshaft of each engine turned in the opposite direction of its counterpart, a relatively easy task for a modular-design aircraft powerplant as the V-1710.|$|E
2500|$|Another year of {{significant}} development was required {{before the new}} RP-4 design was complete, having been extensively re-designed by Ferris Smith, a well known aeronautical engineer. Testing was accomplished by mounting the models to a framework {{on the front of}} a Packard Twelve Senior and driving up and down Muroc Dry Lake at speeds up to [...] Along with significant changes to the aerodynamics, the new design featured side-by-side contra-rotating propellers to eliminate <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> from its new Sidewinder engine, and tricycle landing gear. The RP-4 also used a new joystick-based control system that operators found far easier to use. Three examples were delivered to the Army, who placed an order for an additional 53 examples.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{negative}} feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. [...] The error signal is {{the departure of the}} speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.|$|E
50|$|The CamPro CPS engine uses a {{variable}} valve lift system (Cam Profile Switching system) and {{a variable}} length intake manifold (VIM; {{not to be}} confused with the stand-alone IAFM used in the 2008 Proton Saga) to boost maximum power and improve the CPS <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> curve over the original CamPro engine.|$|R

5000|$|The CX-7 {{features}} {{fully independent}} suspension, four wheel ventilated disc brakes with standard anti-lock brakes, stability control and traction control, and {{a choice of}} either front-wheel drive, or Mazda's Active Torque-Split all wheel drive system. With the Active Torque Split system, two computer controlled magnetic clutches feed up to 50% of the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> to the rear wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first ever}} series {{production}} DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250 six-speed dual-clutch transmission, with dual concentric wet multiplate clutches. [...] It was produced at the Group's Kassel plant under exclusive license from BorgWarner {{for use in}} transverse powertrain installations, of either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD) layouts. The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on power take-off unit to direct <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> to the Haldex Traction rear axle. [...] This DQ250 variant is used {{in a wide range}} of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars (Polo, Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus, Scirocco, Jetta, Eos, Passat, and Touran); Audi cars (A3, and TT); SEAT cars (Ibiza, León, Altea, and Toledo); Škoda cars (Octavia and Superb); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles (Caddy and T5 Transporter).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip {{down on the side}} of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the next}} {{race of the}} season in Barcelona, Räikkönen was unhappy with the setup of the car and was able to qualify only in 7th place. However, he had a good opening lap in the race and made up 2 places to finish the race in 5th position. Räikkönen termed Monaco GP {{qualifying}} session to be a [...] "disaster"; he was only able to qualify in 6th position, with his teammate Sebastian Vettel qualifying in 3rd, followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat in the Red Bulls. In the race, Räikkönen was able to move up to 5th place, before being controversially overtaken by Ricciardo, and thus held his qualifying position to finish the race in 6th, while Lewis Hamilton was robbed of his race win by a botched up pit stop strategy. Räikkönen put up a strong qualifying performance at Montreal to take 3rd on the grid behind the two Mercedes drivers. During the race, while on the out-lap from a pitstop, Räikkönen suffered a repeat of the incident at the previous year's race and spun at the hairpin, which was attributed to an <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> mapping issue. This caused him to lose his 3rd place to Valtteri Bottas. In the Austrian Grand Prix he was involved in a big crash with Fernando Alonso which left Alonso's McLaren on top of Räikkönen's Ferrari. However both left unscathed. After a disappointing showing caused by changing weather in Great Britain, Räikkönen bounced back strongly running second behind Vettel looking set for a 1–2 in Hungary, when a technical failure regarding the energy recovery system meant he lost straightline speed. An untimely safety car meant losing further positions after the restart and after a pitstop to re-fire the engine meant he dropped out of the points he retired when the problem did not fix itself as he had lost the chance to get back past any cars.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} transmissions used on AWD equipped vehicles will normally send 60% of the <b>engine's</b> <b>torque</b> {{to the front}} wheels and 40% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate transfer clutch.
