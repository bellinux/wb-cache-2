5|$|In 1940 Ye Qianyu met {{the dancer}} Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An {{overseas}} Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai {{had come to}} Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been her own child.|$|E

She sports a bob of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume; and has an aggressive fighting style. Throughout her early appearances in All Star Comics, she is often at odds with Wildcat because his penchant for talking to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were an ordinary human female rather than a superpowered Kryptonian annoys her.|$|E
500|$|Mike Nichols, who {{directed}} Streep in Silkwood, Heartburn, Postcards from the Edge and Angels in America, praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that [...] "in every role she becomes {{a totally new}} human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were that person". [...] He said that directing her is [...] "so much like falling in love that it has {{the characteristics of a}} time which you remember as magical but which is shrouded in mystery". He also noted that Streep's acting ability {{had a profound impact on}} her co-stars and that [...] "one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E
500|$|Since February 2006, Lindesfarne has {{had her own}} blog titled [...] "Virtual Quill". Originally, she was posting it as a sort {{of private}} journal, using the inter{{dimension}}al portal to make sure that if it were ever seen by others, it would only be seen by humans from her native dimension (namely, our world), not the dimension she's called home {{for the vast majority of}} her life. She would post generally once a week, talking about the various events in her life and those of her friends and family, providing additional information and insights into what was shown on the strip. Many fans commented back to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were a real person, but she couldn’t see those comments at first because her interdimensional Internet connection was one-way (write-only).|$|E
500|$|The 15-year-old King fell {{seriously ill}} in February 1553. His sister Mary {{was invited to}} visit him, the Council doing [...] "duty and obeisance to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been Queen of England". The King {{recovered}} somewhat, and in April Northumberland restored Mary's full title and arms as Princess of England, which she had lost in the 1530s. He also kept her informed about Edward's condition. About this time a set of drawn-out marriage negotiations came to conclusion. On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley, Northumberland's second youngest son, married Lady Jane Grey, the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and, through her mother Frances Brandon, a grandniece of Henry VIII. Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, and another Katherine, Guildford's younger sister, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. Within a month {{the first of these}} marriages turned out to be highly significant. Although marked by magnificent festivities, at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.|$|E

2500|$|Under the sub-title, [...] "The New Amys", Adam Thompson {{wrote in}} The Times on 30 December 2007 that [...] "Duffy, Estelle, Gabriella Cilmi and Adele lead the charge {{to be the}} next Winehouse. First {{sightings}} seem to indicate that they are all bright-eyed innocents with bags of talent– a familiar starting point, no?" [...] She said at first she did not understand the comparisons to Dusty Springfield and believes the comparisons with others or putting her in a movement is [...] "a gimmick" [...] and noted that [...] "nobody is replaceable". Later some of Springfield's friends sought out and befriended Duffy. Duffy was quoted as saying they tell her she is much like Springfield and talk to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were around during the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Although general {{relativity}} {{is not required}} to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of {{general relativity}} does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. [...] When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, {{so much so that the}} net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. As will be discussed in the forthcoming section Curvature of time, the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.|$|E
2500|$|Manrico realises {{that he is}} not the son of Azucena, but loves <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were indeed}} his mother, as she has always been {{faithful}} and loving to him - and, indeed, saved his life only recently, discovering him left for dead on a battlefield after being caught in ambush. Manrico tells Azucena that he defeated di Luna in their earlier duel, but was held back from killing him by a mysterious power (Duet: Mal reggendo / [...] "He was helpless under my savage attack"): and Azucena reproaches him for having stayed his hand then, especially since it was the Count's forces that defeated him in the subsequent battle of Pelilla. [...] A messenger arrives and reports that Manrico's allies have taken Castle Castellor, which Manrico is ordered to hold in the name of his prince: and also that Leonora, who believes Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent and take the veil that night. Although Azucena tries to prevent him from leaving in his weak state (Ferma! Son io che parlo a te! / [...] "I must talk to you"), Manrico rushes away to prevent her from carrying out this intent.|$|E

2500|$|On September 11, 2014, African-American actress Danièle Watts was {{temporarily}} detained by the LAPD {{when she and}} her boyfriend were in Studio City. Watts accused the officers who stopped her of racially profiling her because she was African-American and her boyfriend was Caucasian, claiming that they treated <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was a [...] "prostitute" [...] and that the officers had been disrespectful to her because she was African-American. LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker {{who was one of the}} two officers accused by Watts of misconduct, released a personal audio recording of the entire incident to TMZ. The recording showed that police had received a 911 call about lewd acts in a car and the couple who were described to have committed the lewd acts fit Watts' and her boyfriend's description. It also showed that when officers arrived on the scene, Watts' boyfriend cooperated with police but Watts refused to cooperate and identify herself, accused the officers of racism, and ignored officers requests and walked away from them leading to her being handcuffed and temporarily detained. Following the release of the recording, local civil rights activists called for Watts to apologize to the LAPD for falsely accusing them of racial profiling but Watts refused. The two officers were cleared of any wrongdoing by the department shortly after the release of the audio recordings.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Zohar, Rabbi Abba {{was once}} going toward Lod {{when he met}} Rabbi Zeira, the son of Rav. [...] Quoting [...] "And he {{believed}} in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness," [...] Rabbi Zeira asked whether it means that God counted it to Abraham, or that Abraham counted it to God. [...] Rabbi Zeira {{reported that he had}} heard that it means that God counted it to Abraham, but that interpretation did not satisfy him. [...] Rabbi Abba replied that it is indeed not so. [...] Noting that [...] says, [...] "and he reckoned her" [...] ( [...] , vayahsh'veha)" [...] and not [...] "and he reckoned to him ( [...] , vayahshov lo)," [...] Rabbi Abba taught that this means that Abraham counted it to God. [...] For [...] says, [...] "And he brought him forth abroad," [...] meaning that God told Abraham, in effect, to give up his astrological speculations; that was not the way to acquire knowledge of God’s Name. [...] Abram, it was true, would not beget children, but Abraham would beget children. [...] says, [...] "So ( [...] , Koh) shall your seed be." [...] The word , Koh, expresses the tenth sacred Crown of the King by which God’s Name may be known; it is the Crown through which judgments are set in motion. [...] Upon hearing God’s promise in [...] Abraham became filled with joy, and [...] "Abraham reckoned Her" [...] — that is, the Crown — [...] "for righteousness"; that is, he reckoned <b>Her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>She</b> were Compassion, because She had told him that he would father Isaac.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{exhibition}} in London {{just a few}} years after the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807 created a scandal. This is in part because British audiences misread Hendrik Cesars, thinking he was a Dutch farmer, boer, from the frontier. Scholars have tended to reproduce that error, but tax rolls at the Cape show he was free black. Violence was part of the show. An abolitionist benevolent society called the African Association conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. Zachary Macaulay led the protest. Hendrik Cesars protested that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: [...] "has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?" [...] Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants Charles Byrne and Patrick Cotter O'Brien. Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on November 24, 1810 at the Court of King's Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt [...] "to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent." [...] In support he produced two affidavits in court. [...] The first, from a Mr Bullock of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show Baartman had been brought to Britain by persons who referred to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were property. [...] The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion. Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in Dutch, in which she was fluent, via interpreters. However the conditions of the interview were stacked against her, in part again because the court saw Hendrik Cesars as the boer exploiter, rather than seeing Alexander Dunlop as the organizer. [...] They thus ensured that Cesars was not in the room when Baartman made her statement, but Dunlop was allowed to remain.|$|E
