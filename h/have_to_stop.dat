5|$|Dropped {{into the}} swamp where Keyes and his squad disappeared, the Master Chief discovers that the Captain has been {{captured}} and {{both human and}} Covenant soldiers have been turned into zombie-like creatures by bulbous aliens. One soldier, Private Wallace Jenkins, is left still semi-conscious and painfully aware of his predicament, unable to control his movement or actions as his former friends and he attack McKay's troops. Jenkins intends on ending his life, but is instead captured by McKay for study. The Chief is approached by Halo's resident A.I., 343 Guilty Spark, who informs the Chief that the creatures he has encountered are called the Flood, a virulent parasite that infects hosts and converts them into either forms for combat, or for reproduction. To activate Halo's defenses, Guilty Spark needs the Master Chief's help. In Halo's Control Room, Guilty Spark gives the Master Chief the key to activate Halo, but is stopped by a furious Cortana. Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon, but it doesn't kill the Flood- it kills their food, meaning humans, Covenant, and any other sentient life. Realizing that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Guilty Spark from activating Halo, Cortana and the Master Chief decide to destroy Halo by detonating the crash-landed Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors. In order to do this, they need Captain Keyes' neural implants. Cortana discovers the Captain is still alive, held prisoner once again aboard the Truth and Reconciliation, {{now in the hands}} of the Flood who are trying to escape Halo. The Chief fights Covenant and Flood to the Captain, but finds out he is too late—the Captain has been assimilated into the parasite. The Chief retrieves the implants and leaves the Truth for the Autumn.|$|E

Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to Robert Engelman (Worldwatch institute), {{in order to prevent}} collapse, human civilization would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).|$|E

25|$|From 1944 Baird was {{suffering}} from increasingly poor health, and late that year he suffered an attack of fever that left him almost invalid. Nevertheless, he formed a new company, John Logie Baird Ltd., with offices and labs in a downtown London house. Baird visited the lab less and less frequently over time, and his wife noticed why in a November 1945 visit when he was seen to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and pant after climbing every stair of the building's four stories. He caught a cold over Christmas 1945, and suffered a stroke in February 1946. He was ordered bedridden but refused to stay there, and continued to deteriorate until his death on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|The N2/M2, {{which the}} Government {{announced}} in March 2005 {{would not be}} tolled, allows thousands of commuters and hauliers to avoid the town, {{which has become a}} major bottleneck for traffic heading south from County Donegal, County Londonderry, County Tyrone, County Monaghan, County Louth and the rest of County Meath. The South Ashbourne Interchange, a large junction taking traffic on and off the N2 near the Nine Mile Stone, allows non-stop transferral of traffic to and from Ashbourne and its new by-pass. Phase II of the M50 upgrade, opened in 2010, links the N2 to the M50 at exit 5 with a partial freeflow junction, meaning most traffic transferring from the M50 to the N2 and vice versa does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> (traffic lights remain where traffic from the M50 southbound meets traffic from the N2 southbound).|$|E

25|$|NOK700 {{million has}} been {{allocated}} {{to build a new}} station at Homansbyen, in the residential area of Frogner, roughly midway between Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen. The station is estimated to have 10,000 daily travelers, and funding is scheduled for the period 2014 to 2017. Ruter has stated that they are opposed to building the station, and have made any decision in their long-term plan from 2010 to 2030 regarding if the station should be built. The company has stated that the area has a good tram service, and is in no need of rapid transit. Because the station would be deep underground, travel time gains to the city center for local residents would be small, compared to using the tram. Also, all travelers taking the metro west of the city center would receive longer travel time, since all trains would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at Homansbyen. Ruter is also concerned that a rapid transit station would take ridership away from the trams, which previously have been threatened with closure. The imminent planned upgrades to the section of the tunnel do not include any intermediate stations.|$|E
25|$|In the Suite du Merlin, for example, Niviane, {{who was the}} {{daughter}} of the king of Northumberland, is about to depart from Arthur's court, but, with some encouragement from Merlin, Arthur asks her to stay in his castle with the queen. During her stay, Merlin falls in love with her and desires her. Niviane, frightened that Merlin might take advantage of her with his spells, swears that she will never love him unless he swears to teach her all of his magic. Merlin consents, unaware that throughout the course of her lessons, Niviane will use Merlin's own powers against him, forcing him to do her bidding. When Niviane finally goes back to her country, Merlin escorts her. However, along the way, Merlin receives a vision that Arthur is in need of assistance against the schemes of Morgan. Niviane and Merlin rush back to Arthur's castle, but <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> for the night in a stone chamber, once inhabited by two lovers. Merlin relates that when the lovers died, they were placed in a magic tomb within a room in the chamber. That night, while Merlin is asleep, Niviane, still disgusted with Merlin's desire for her, as well as his demonic heritage, casts a spell over him and places him in the magic tomb so that he can never escape, thus causing his death.|$|E
