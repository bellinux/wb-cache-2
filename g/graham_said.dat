500|$|Brown was {{succeeded by}} his son Mike as Bengals' team president. Subsequently, in 2000, Cincinnati opened a new {{football}} facility on the Ohio River, naming it Paul Brown Stadium. Brown was elected in 1967 to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. [...] "I feel he's as fine a coach as the game ever has had", Otto <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> at the induction ceremony. [...] "I used to cuss him out and complain but now I'm happy that I played under him." [...] In 2009, Sporting News named Brown as the 12th greatest coach of all time; only two other NFL coaches were listed above him.|$|E
500|$|Most of Motley's runs were trap plays up the middle, {{but he had}} {{the speed}} to run outside. [...] "There's no telling how much yardage I might have made if I ran as much as some backs do now," [...] he once said. Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{portrays the}} mind of a {{psychotic}} killer. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated the song [...] "trawls the area occupied by either or both , getting inside the head of a protagonist who's careening into psychosis." [...] He added that the point of [...] "Exit" [...] was [...] "to convey the state of mind of someone driven, by whatever powerful urges, to the very brink of desperation." [...] Stokes felt that [...] "the undercurrent of religious imagery" [...] in the song was a response to [...] "the fanaticism implicit in faith", and that the song allowed U2 to [...] " [...] own demons, their own anger and fury at the [...] fate had thrust upon them. Another Hot Press contributor, Bill <b>Graham,</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Exit" [...] allowed U2 to [...] "finally confess their gradual recognition of the Anti-Christ in everybody." ...|$|E

500|$|Making the {{relationship}} even more strained, only months later, Griswold {{was hired by}} George Rex Graham to take up Poe's former position as editor of Graham's Magazine. Griswold, however, was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe. Shortly after, Poe began presenting a series of lectures called [...] "The Poets and Poetry of America", {{the first of which}} was given in Philadelphia on November 25, 1843. Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures. <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> that during these lectures, Poe [...] "gave Mr. Griswold some raps over the knuckles of force sufficient to be remembered". In a letter dated January 16, 1845, Poe tried to reconcile with Griswold, promising him that his lecture now omitted all that Griswold found objectionable.|$|E
500|$|Impressed by Graham's {{performances}} in Northwestern's wins over the Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and {{offered him a}} contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in [...] dollars) in 1945 {{to play for a}} professional team he was coaching in Cleveland in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly stipend of $250 ($ in [...] ) {{until the end of the}} war. It was a large amount of money at the time. [...] "All I asked was, where do I sign?" [...] <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> later. [...] "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever." [...] Graham was also drafted by the National Football League's Detroit Lions, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.|$|E
500|$|Speedie had a {{brief and}} cold reunion with Brown in 1977, when the two met at the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. Speedie {{introduced}} himself to Brown, only to be told, [...] "Yes, I know. You're the one who went to Canada." [...] Speedie's friends and former teammates lobbied repeatedly for his inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but Speedie believed that his conflict with Brown was keeping him out even as numerous former teammates, including Otto Graham, Dante Lavelli and Marion Motley were inducted. He was placed on an old-timers' list of nominees for induction into the hall in the mid-1980s, but ultimately was passed over. [...] "Quite honestly, I think Paul Brown is the reason" [...] for Speedie's exclusion, <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> in 1991. [...] "Paul wasn't {{the type of guy}} you crossed. He would never forget it." ...|$|E

500|$|London-based studio Union {{created the}} film's visual effects. According to editor Elliot Graham, {{extensive}} film editing took place even before principal photography was completed. During the one-week rehearsal {{that took place}} in between production {{for each of the three}} acts (shot in chronological order), Graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with Variety, <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> a particular challenge for him was balancing the shot frequency and providing enough [...] "visual interventions" [...] to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as [...] "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during post-production. Graham also said: [...] "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away. He would say 'if I'm with you the whole time, we'll always have the same opinions because we're on the exact same journey.'" ...|$|E
500|$|That's {{really hard}} {{because you have}} to gauge the weather each time {{you have to make a}} decision. As for what {{happened}} last night, I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
500|$|The Akron Community Foundation {{established}} a Dante Lavelli Scholarship Fund in 2010 to help Hudson High athletes pay for college. [...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] <b>Graham</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

500|$|Collier {{served under}} Brown from 1946 to 1953, {{a period in}} which the team won all four titles in the AAFC before moving to the National Football League (NFL) in 1950. That season the Browns {{captured}} the NFL title and then reached but lost the following three championship games. Collier's coaching style was the opposite of Brown's; Brown was a disciplinarian whose stern nature and aloofness often brought him into conflict with players, while Collier was a friendly, warm man whose patience and studiousness endeared him to players. [...] "Everything had to be perfect; he was a stickler on perfection – but at the same time, he had great patience," [...] Browns quarterback Otto <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> in 2007. After the 1946 season, Brown asked Collier to analyze every play run by the offense, and Collier came up with a detailed breakdown of why each play succeeded or failed. This was the genesis of an annual grading system Collier developed to evaluate players' performance. The Browns used it for many years.|$|E
500|$|Reviews written {{during the}} initial arena legs {{reflected}} the dramatic change in U2's approach. Many critics published favourable reviews about the tour. The San Francisco Chronicle praised the special effects for supplementing the music. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The often-surrealistic effects always served the songs, {{not the other way}} around." [...] The review concluded, [...] "this magnificent multimedia production will serve as a pinnacle in rock's onstage history for sometime to come". Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that U2 was dismantling its myth and wrote that the show was [...] "a trippy and decadent concert of bedazzling visuals and adventurous music". Melody Makers Jon Wiederhorn wrote that he expected to dislike the show based upon their past stage history, [...] "But, alas, I cannot be negative about U2 tonight. Their Zoo TV show is visually stunning, musically unparalleled, downright moving and, dammit, truly entertaining." [...] Hot Press Bill <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> of the show, [...] "U2 don't so much use every trick in the book as invent a whole new style of rock performance art." [...] For Graham, the tour resolved any doubts he had about the band—particularly about Bono—following their reinvention with Achtung Baby.|$|E
500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "metaphorically ambivalent". Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton's bassline [...] "ominous". Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock. Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track.... Far more than even 'Bullet the Blue Sky', [...] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste", describing it as the wild card of the album. Author John Luerssen contrasted it {{to the rest of}} the band's catalogue, saying [...] "Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point, 'Exit' lacked any optimism." [...] Hot Press contributor Colm O'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson's use of [...] "Helter Skelter", and contained [...] "even more sinister shades" [...] of the death of John Lennon. In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough to remind you that not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode, simply saying he [...] "loved this episode," [...] {{giving it a}} perfect 10 out of 10 score. Canning enjoyed Jack and Devon's back-and-forth, and wrote that Jenna and Tracy [...] "tormenting" [...] Liz in their separate ways were [...] "equally gratifying." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "To all those haters who say 30 Rock is losing its touch, I say 'poppycock!' [...] was proof that the show is as zippy as ever." [...] She noted that Jack's plot [...] "didn't make {{a whole lot of}} sense", nonetheless [...] "anything that means more Will Arnett on 30 Rock is fine by me." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported it was great to see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. In his recap, TV Guides [...] Michael Anthony said that the Jack and Devon characters [...] "really [...] how to put a playful spin" [...] on the bail out and government money story.|$|E
500|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{cautious}} Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out {{ways of dealing with}} each other. In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread how bad the economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration. On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter [...] "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..." [...] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk [...] " [...] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit." [...] Former Senate colleague Lindsey <b>Graham</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like." [...] Biden gained a long-running alter ego persona, [...] "The President of Vice", on the satirical news site The Onion, which parodied his job title. [...] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.|$|E
500|$|Qs Paul Du Noyer {{said that}} the source of The Joshua Trees [...] "potency lies in a kind of spiritual {{frustration}} – a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives." [...] He concluded his review by writing that the music [...] "has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a thing so often absent: the urge to exist". Spin hailed the record as U2's [...] "first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material". The review stated, [...] "There isn't a bad song on the record" [...] and that [...] "every one has a hook". The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album [...] "confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world". Hilburn noted that the band showed [...] "sometimes breathtaking signs of growth" [...] and played more [...] "tailored and assured" [...] music. Hot Press editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill <b>Graham</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "The Joshua Tree rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions," [...] and that U2 [...] "must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock". John Rockwell of The New York Times was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono's vocals were [...] "marred throughout by sobbing affectation" [...] and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a [...] "curious loss of individuality". The Houston Chronicles Marty Racine felt it has [...] "music that both soothes and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style". Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is [...] "not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious", which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found the lyrics tasteful and the music [...] "mournful and passionate, stately and involved", but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it [...] "one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom".|$|E
