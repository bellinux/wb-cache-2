5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana. His father died in 1895, and {{to make ends meet}} his mother took work at a canning plant. As the eldest child at the age of five, Sanders was left to care for his two siblings. When he turned seven his mother taught him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook.</b> After leaving the family home at age 13, Sanders pursued several professions {{including}} railroad worker and insurance salesman, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, a small city {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. By June, he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table, serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had to know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven {{to ensure that the}} bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook.</b> After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E

Attempts were made to engage the couples but one problem was that none of the sisters knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook.</b> Upon returning to Puebla, their mother sent them to the Convent of Santa Monica to learn. The women decided they wanted to make an original dish to impress Iturbide and his officers when they were due to visit Puebla. The dish, chiles en nogada, represents the colors of the Mexican flag, green (parsley), white (the walnut sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds). The dish was served for the first time at a banquet for Iturbide with great success.|$|E
25|$|A 1962 {{appearance}} {{on a book}} review show on {{what was then the}} National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH-TV (now a major Public Broadcasting Service station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> an omelette.

She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing and unaffected manner. In 1972, The French Chef became the first television program to be captioned for the deaf, even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.|$|E
