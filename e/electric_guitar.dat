5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses <b>electric</b> <b>guitar,</b> bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth.

5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an <b>electric</b> <b>guitar,</b> {{he could barely}} {{be heard over the}} sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club.

5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> {{is often}} emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> and bass.|$|E

5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless <b>electric</b> <b>guitar</b> and bass pickups.|$|E
