25|$|Buntlines, spaced {{every few}} feet {{along the front}} of a sail, run from a point on the mast above the yard to the foot (bottom edge) of the sail and serve to raise the foot up for {{shortening}} sail or for <b>furling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brails {{run from}} the leech of a fore-and-aft rigged sail (a spanker or lateen mizzen, for example) to the gaff and mast and serve the same {{function}} as buntlines: to haul in the sail when <b>furling.</b> In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff and a bit up, towards the gaff.|$|E

40|$|Fuzzy Rules {{have been}} shown to be very useful in {{modeling}} relationships between variables that have a high degree of uncertainty or ambiguity. A major question in regards to learning fuzzy rule bases is how to handle interactions between rules of overlapping coverage. Structures, such as Yager's HPS (Hierarchical Prioritized Structure), have been proposed to answer this question. In this paper, we present our system of learning a hierarchical fuzzy rule base named <b>FURL</b> (for FUzzy Rule Learner). <b>FURL</b> takes advantage of the properties of HPS to learn hierarchical levels of fuzzy rules. <b>FURL</b> applies machine-learning techniques from theory revision such as credit assignment and repair to fuzzy rules. We also discuss the results of testing <b>FURL</b> on multiple benchmark datasets and finally discuss our results...|$|R
25|$|In 1945 the Sou’wester {{sailboat}} was created. 62 original Sou’Westers were built, {{making it}} the largest fleet of single design cruising boats of its time. During the 1950s, Hinckley began experimenting {{with the use of}} fiberglass to construct his yachts’ hulls. His first fiberglass boat, the Bermuda 40 sailing ship, was released in 1959. The last Hinckley-built wooden boat was the 1960 “Osprey.” Throughout the 1960s the company provided navigation systems along with auto-pilot and electric-powered <b>furling</b> mainsails.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before Lugosi's {{death in}} August 1956, {{he had been}} working with Wood on {{numerous}} half-realized projects, variously titled Tomb of the Vampire or The Ghoul Goes West. Scenes unconnected to Plan 9, featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking {{in and out of the}} side door of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before <b>furling</b> it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like Plan 9 in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about Ghoul being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|The 1891 {{championship}} saw {{the novelty}} of Kerry contesting the All-Ireland final with Wexford. The game itself was the second game of a triple-header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This {{was followed by the}} All-Ireland <b>furling</b> final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider was an exciting affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry’s first point after five minutes with the team’s second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0-2 to 0-1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain John Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third half hour of hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All-Ireland final. Kerry {{went on to win the}} game by 2-3 to 1-5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland hurling title.|$|E
40|$|How can we {{accurately}} estimate local triangles for all nodes {{in simple}} and multigraph streams? Local triangle counting in a graph stream {{is one of}} the most fundamental tasks in graph mining with important applications including anomaly detection and social network analysis. Although there have been several local triangle counting methods in a graph stream, their estimation has a large variance which results in low accuracy, and they do not consider multigraph streams which have duplicate edges. In this paper, we propose <b>FURL,</b> an accurate local triangle counting method for simple and multigraph streams. <b>FURL</b> improves the accuracy by reducing a variance through biased estimation and handles duplicate edges for multigraph streams. Also, <b>FURL</b> handles a stream of any size by using a fixed amount of memory. Experimental results show that <b>FURL</b> outperforms the state-of-the-art method in accuracy and performs well in multigraph streams. In addition, we report interesting patterns discovered from real graphs by <b>FURL,</b> which include unusual local structures in a user communication network and a core-periphery structure in the Web.

500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but {{a lot easier to}} follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of <b>furling</b> its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E

However, [...] "Saint Helena Soldier" [...] and [...] "Johnny Bowker" [...] have also been noted.|$|E
