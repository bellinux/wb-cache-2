40|$|A {{numerical}} model and technique are described {{to simulate the}} turbulent fluid flow over and heat transfer through a model of vehicle windshield <b>defrosting</b> <b>and</b> <b>demisting</b> systems. The simplified geometry and {{the dimensions of the}} {{numerical model}} are representative of vehicle system with accurate locations of the nozzles and outlet vents, including cabin features such as seating and the rear parcel shelf. The three-dimensional geometry of the numerical model is created in Auto Cad (Release 14). Surface meshing and a computational mesh of 750, 000 (tetrahedral) fluid cells is generated in the pre-processor of the CFD software used for the simulation of the fluid flow. Turbulence is modelled by using the k-e turbulence equations together with the wall function method. This decision was made after comparing the k-e model's performance with that of lower order models, and after considering the increased computer time requirements and decreased stability of more complex models, such as the Reynolds stress model. The numerical results of the study are very encouraging and compare favourably with measurements obtained from the actual vehicle by Thermograph and Hot Bulb probe techniques. The findings highlight some of the drawbacks of the existing design of the windshield systems and show that the maximum flow rates occur {{in the vicinity of the}} lower part of the windshield, progressing from the defroster nozzle in the dashboard...|$|E

40|$|As a {{participant}} in the three-nation partnership for development of the ANBCP-S for use in Helicopters, Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet, the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF) picked up the challenge to design a Filter- Blower-Unit (FBU). Major Command (MajCom) of the RNLAF set priority to develop a system for Helicopter use first. After that the same system is to be used in Transport Aircraft and Fast Jet. The FBU is supposed to provide clean air for breathing, body and head cooling <b>and</b> <b>demist</b> of the vision system. Because of special knowledge required to set specifications for this FBU, the RNLAF contracted a Dutch Research Institute, TNO. TNO has the capability to do all research and testing to set all requirements. The RNLAF asked TNO to quantify the amount of air needed for breathing, body and head cooling <b>and</b> <b>demist</b> of the vision system. Some of the basic requirements set by MajCom are: - The system must be Man mounted, - Battery powered; - Filtersytem must be based on the NATO canister system; - It has to operate continues, without major changes, for a period of eight hours. Several trails were performed to quantify the acquired amount of air in terms of oxygen consumption, ventilation and corresponding cooling rates. During those trails it became clear {{there is a big difference}} in consumption between a Pilot and a Loadmaster. Therefore our primary goal is to develop a system which is suitable for the most difficult crewmember to equip. To the opinion of TNO and RNLAF that is the Loadmaster. TNO performed trails in house and on location. On location they used the equipment of Soesterberg (SSB) Airforce Base (AFB) (The Netherlands) and flightsimulators in Marseille (France) (AS 532 U 2) en Benson (United Kingdom) (CH 47 D). Simultaneous the RNLAF performed some integration test to find out the maximum volume of the configuration of the FBU with power source.

40|$|The {{rotational}} {{particle separator}} (RPS) has a cyclone type house within which a rotating cylinder is placed. The rotating cylinder is an assembly {{of a large}} number of axially oriented channels, e. g. small diameter pipes. Micron-sized particles entrained in the fluid flowing through the channels are centrifugated towards the walls of the channels. Here they form a layer or film of particles material which is removed by applying pressure pulses or by flowing of the film itself. Compared to conventional cyclones the RPS is an order of magnitude smaller in size at equal separation performance, while at equal size it separates particles ten times smaller. Applications of the RPS considered are: ash removal from hot flue gases in small scale combustion installations, product recovery in stainless environment for pharma/food, oil water separation <b>and</b> <b>demisting</b> of gases.

40|$|When a {{spectacle}} wearer enters a warm environment {{after having been}} in a cooler one, his/her spectacles may ‘mist up’ due {{to the formation of}} condensation on the lens surface. Both the physical properties of the spectacle lens and a number of environmental factors determine how long spectacles take to demist. The relative misting performance of crown glass, CR 39 and polycarbonate spectacle lenses were assessed using a novel technique. A box in which the environmental conditions could be controlled was used first to cool the lens and then to warm it. This change in temperature caused condensation to form on the lens surface. By projecting the image of a grating through the lens onto a linear array of photodiodes it was possible to measure the contrast transmission of the spectacle lens as it demister. Each lens type misted <b>and</b> <b>demisted</b> in a characteristic way. The polycarbonate lens demisted more rapidly than the CR 39 lens which, in turn, demisted more rapidly than the glass lens.
