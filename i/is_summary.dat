This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing.

This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E

6000|$|In {{these last}} {{years of his life}} Friedrich had many French of {{distinction}} visiting him. In 1782, the Abbe Raynal (whom, except for his power of face, he admired little); [Rodenbeck, iii. 277 n.] in 1786, Mirabeau (whose personal qualities seem to have pleased him);--but chiefly, in the interval between these two, various Military Frenchmen, now home with their laurels from the American War, coming about his Reviews: eager to see the Great Man, and be seen by him. Lafayette, Segur and many others came; of whom the one interesting to us is Marquis de Bouille: already known for his swift sharp operation on the English Leeward Islands; and memorable afterwards to all the world for his presidency in the FLIGHT TO VARENNES of poor Louis XVI. and his Queen, in 1791; which was by no means so successful. [...] "The brave Bouille," [...] as we called him long since, when writing of that latter operation, elsewhere. Bouille left MEMOIRES of his own: which speak of Friedrich: in the Vie de Bouille, published recently by friendly hands: [Rene de Bouille, ESSAI SUR LA VIE DU MARQUIS DE BOUILLE (Paris, 1853)] there <b>is</b> <b>Summary</b> given of all that his Papers say on Friedrich; this, in still briefer shape, but unchanged otherwise, readers shall now see.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, American civil {{procedure}} has several notable features, including extensive pretrial discovery, {{heavy reliance on}} live testimony obtained at deposition or elicited {{in front of a}} jury, and aggressive pretrial [...] "law and motion" [...] practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition (that <b>is,</b> <b>summary</b> judgment) or a settlement. U.S. courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out class action, by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment, as opposed to opt-in class actions, where class members must join into the class. Another unique feature is the so-called American Rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys' fees (as opposed to the English Rule of [...] "loser pays"), though American legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions.|$|E
50|$|The {{court found}} that, {{although}} the procedure provided for in s 72(4) <b>is</b> <b>summary</b> {{and does not}} conform to the customary adversarial trial procedure, the enquiring court is obliged to furnish details of the alleged offence to the accused. The elements of the charge {{are likely to be}} very simple. Should the accused require particularity, however, the enquiring court must furnish it there and then. The absence of a formal written charge-sheet, therefore, is of no consequence. While the accused does not have the opportunity to make a formal written request for further particulars, he nevertheless enjoys the right to be informed of the details of the charge against him. The court held, accordingly, that the summary procedure does not, in this respect, limit the accused's right to a fair trial. There is, furthermore, nothing is section 72(4) to the effect that the right to adduce and challenge evidence is limited.|$|E

5000|$|The Rule 12(b)(6) motion, which {{replaced}} {{the common law}} demurrer, is how lawsuits with insufficient legal theories underlying their cause of action are dismissed from court. For example, assault requires intent, so if the plaintiff has failed to plead intent, the defense can seek dismissal by filing a 12(b)(6) motion. [...] "While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation {{of the elements of}} a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." [...] Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (No. 05-1126) (2007) (citations, internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). 12(b)(6) is the second of three procedural [...] "hurdles" [...] a cause of action must surmount before it gets to a trial (the first are the two jurisdictional dismissals, found in 12 (b)(1) and (2), and the third <b>is</b> <b>summary</b> judgment, found in Rule 56). A 12(b)(6) motion cannot include additional evidence such as affidavits. To dispose of claims with insufficient factual basis (where the movant must submit additional facts to demonstrate the factual weakness in the plaintiff's case), a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment is used.|$|E
