Seven major topic areas and 23 subtopics were addressed in Workgroups and platform sessions during the symposium. The primary charge given to platform presenters was to describe {{the state of the}} science in the subtopic areas, whereas the Workgroups were charged with identifying research that could be accomplished in the short- and long-term to reduce scientific uncertainties.

40|$|<b>Harmful</b> <b>Algal</b> <b>Blooms</b> (HABs) are of {{national}} concern because they adversely affect {{not only the}} health of people and marine organisms, but also the "health" of local and regional economies. Health effects range from cell damage to organism mortality through such mechanisms as toxin production and localized conditions of low oxygen. For the past several decades, <b>harmful</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms</b> have caused more than $ 1 billion in losses in the United States, with resources diverted to monitoring programs, closures of shellfish beds and coastal fisheries, severe reductions in local and regional tourism and associated service industries, public illness, and medical treatments and advisories. <b>Harmful</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms</b> occur in almost every U. S. coastal state; examples include toxin-producing dinoflagellates in New England, the mid-Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the entire West Coast including Alaska, and tropical and subtropical states and possessions; toxic diatoms in the Gulf and along the West Coast; and toxin-producing flagellates and gill-clogging diatoms in the Pacific Northwest.
