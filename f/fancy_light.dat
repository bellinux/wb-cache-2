50|$|The Star of the South, {{also known}} as Estrela do Sul, is a diamond found in Brazil in July 1853. The diamond is cut into a cushion shape and weighs 128.48 carat g. The Star of the South is graded as a type IIa diamond, with a colour grading of <b>fancy</b> <b>light</b> pinkish-brown and a clarity of VS2. At the time of discovery, the diamond weighed 254.5 carat g. It has passed through the hands of many owners, {{including}} the Maharaja of princely Baroda State, and its last known purchase was by Cartier, the French luxury jeweller around 2002, when it was sold to them by Rustomjee Jamsetjee of Mumbai. The light reflected by the diamond is white, and the refracted light is of a rose tint. This gives the diamond its light pinkish-brown hue.|$|E
50|$|The {{color in}} red {{diamonds}} is assessed {{according to its}} hue and saturation. Red diamonds can occur with secondary colors, such as brown-red, orange-red, or purple-red, but red is not a modifying color for any other diamond color. Additionally, red diamonds never appear with a tertiary modifying color, {{as is the case}} in other diamond colors. A pure red diamond is ideal but an even rarer find than a red with a secondary color. Like with other diamond colors, a purely red diamond will fetch a higher per carat price than one with a secondary hue. Brownish red and Orangey red diamonds are generally considered inferior to Purplish Red diamonds and are priced accordingly. All of these colors run upwards of $400,000 per carat, but a pure red diamond can cost significantly more per carat. Few colors of fancy color diamonds are characterized by having a singular color intensity. This phenomenon only exists with three colors: black diamonds, white diamonds, and red diamonds. Since the source of the red in red diamonds is considered to be a hyper-concentrated occurrence of pink, this would actually make red the darkest shade of pink possible, which is why it is only able to appear in one intensity. Red diamonds will only be graded Fancy Red, Fancy Brownish Red, Fancy Purplish Red, or Fancy Orangey Red. An easy way to tell whether a red diamond is fake is if the seller is offering it with an intensity grade like other diamond colors (<b>Fancy</b> <b>Light,</b> Fancy Intense, Fancy Vivid etc.). There are so few red diamonds that the GIA records show that over a 30 year period from 1957-1987, not a single GIA lab report with the term “red” was issued. Some diamond polishers have achieved a GIA grading of Fancy Red for a diamond by re-polishing a Fancy Deep Pink diamond, although this is very hard to accomplish and has only been successfully completed less than a handful of times.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} color in all fancy color {{diamonds}}, the color in pink diamonds is assessed {{according to its}} hue, saturation and tone. [...] The hue refers to the primary and secondary colors, the saturation refers to the distribution of color, and the tone refers to {{the darkness of the}} color. Pink diamonds can occur in hues ranging from brown-pink to purple-pink, although pink can also be a modifying color in other diamond colors. Brown, orange and purple are the only occurring secondary hues in pink diamonds although a pink diamond can exhibit both brown and orange overtones at the same time, making it a “brownish orangey pink” diamond. The ideal pink diamonds are generally considered to be those which exhibit pure pink color although purple-pink diamonds are generally very highly regarded as well. Generally speaking, a vivid pink diamond will be more valuable than a larger lighter pink diamond, although it is not always the case according to the Diamond Investment & Intelligence Center. [...] Pink diamonds can occur in eight intensities, faint pink, very light pink, light pink, <b>fancy</b> <b>light</b> pink, fancy pink, fancy intense pink, fancy vivid pink, fancy deep/dark pink. [...] Just like in all fancy color diamonds, the more vivid intensity pink diamonds are far rarer than the less vivid, which is in part why they demand a higher price. The same cause in nature which is the course of the pink in pink diamonds can be more or less concentrated depending on the specimen. That is why it is so rare to find the most concentrated diamonds in each color. There is no perfect consensus as to what defines each color intensity grade, even though the GIA keeps a master catalog of each diamond color. Therefore, each color intensity also has a subscale of 1-10. [...] Within the industry, a diamond trader may call a diamond “Fancy Vivid” or “Fancy Intense” but will often also call the diamond “a 7” or whichever number is most apropos to the diamond’s appearance, which enables the most thorough representation of the diamond’s color intensity.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seed milling fractions {{depends upon the}} relative abundance of various seed tissues in each. <b>Fancy</b> (<b>light)</b> flour contains mainly central endosperm, while the bran milling fraction has seed coat and some embryo tissues. Phytate, found in protein bodies of embryo and aleurone cells, is the major storage form of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and some microelements in seeds. Phytic acid (35 - 38 g kg(- 1)) and minerals are concentrated in bran, a milling fraction with high concentrations of phytate-rich tissues. Polyphenolics, including condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), are also concentrated in bran (11 - 15 g kg(- 1)). Rutin is concentrated in the hull of common buckwheat (0. 8 - 4. 4 g kg(- 1)). Rutin concentration is low (0. 2 - 0. 3 g kg(- 1)) in groats of common buckwheat but higher (0. 7 - 0. 8 g kg(- 1)) in bran containing hull fragments. Rutin is 300 -fold more concentrated (81 g kg(- 1)) in groats of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L) Gaertn) than in groats of common buckwheat. Only small amounts of quercetin were detected. Bran is a concentrated source of phytic acid and tannins, a consideration in consumption of large amounts of buckwheat bran for nutritional or medicinal purposes.
