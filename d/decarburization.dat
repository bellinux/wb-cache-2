5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing <b>decarburization.</b> Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of <b>decarburization,</b> i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
500|$|Although Chinese civilization {{lacked the}} bloomery, the Han Chinese {{were able to}} make wrought iron when they {{injected}} too much oxygen into the cupola furnace, causing <b>decarburization.</b> The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and steel by using the finery forge and puddling process, the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near Mount Song of Henan province. The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with refractory bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay. Besides charcoal made of wood, Wang Zhongshu states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were [...] "coal cakes", a mixture of coal powder, clay, and quartz.|$|E
2500|$|During the [...] {{annealing}} process of die making, two main errors can occur, resulting {{in less than}} perfect dies. It is impossible to tell without expensive and lengthy tests whether these errors occurred, but they will lead to significantly weaker dies and a higher tendency to deteriorate quickly. The first thing which can happen to a die in this process what metallurgists call <b>decarburization.</b> <b>Decarburization</b> {{is the result of}} an improper mix of metals and chemicals in the annealing furnace where the dies are sent to soften. If there is not enough ambient carbon in the furnace, the steel will give up some of its carbon and will become soft. The result is a thin surface of inadequate metal whose chemical composition has been altered and is below standard.|$|E
50|$|The heating {{of steel}} is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} method to alter the carbon content. When steel is heated in an oxidizing environment, the oxygen combines with the iron to form an iron-oxide layer, which protects the steel from <b>decarburization.</b> When the steel turns to austenite, however, the oxygen combines with iron to form slag, which provides no protection from <b>decarburization.</b> The formation of slag and scale actually increases <b>decarburization,</b> because the iron oxide keeps oxygen {{in contact with the}} <b>decarburization</b> zone even after the steel is moved into an oxygen-free environment, such as the coals of a forge. Thus, the carbon atoms begin combining with the surrounding scale and slag to form both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which is released into the air.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Decarburization</b> is {{the process}} of {{decreasing}} the carbon content in metallurgy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decarburization</b> (or decarbonization) is {{the process}} {{opposite}} to carburization, namely the reduction of carbon content.|$|E

5000|$|Argon oxygen <b>decarburization</b> (AOD) is {{a process}} {{primarily}} used in stainless steel making and other high grade alloys with oxidizable elements such as chromium and aluminum. After initial melting the metal is then transferred to an AOD vessel {{where it will be}} subjected to three steps of refining; <b>decarburization,</b> reduction, and desulphurization. AOD was invented in 1954 by the Lindé Division of The Union Carbide Corporation [...] (which became known as Praxair in 1992).|$|E
50|$|The Stassano furnace {{produces}} steel by fusing {{scrap iron}} and cast iron and operating a successive <b>decarburization</b> of the fused material.|$|E
50|$|Dealuminification is a {{corresponding}} process for aluminum alloys. Similar effects for different metals are <b>decarburization</b> (removal of carbon {{from the surface}} of alloy), decobaltification, denickelification, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the <b>decarburization</b> step, {{one more}} step {{should be taken into}} consideration: de-siliconization, which is a very {{important}} factor for refractory lining and further refinement.|$|E
50|$|The <b>decarburization</b> {{mechanism}} can {{be described}} as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen {{present in}} metals can produce {{several kinds of}} {{internal}} defects like blisters, shatter fracture, flakes, fish-eyes and porosity. Carbon steels exposed to hydrogen at high temperatures experience hydrogen attack which leads to internal <b>decarburization</b> and weakening.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{components}} (like chromium and molybdenum) of some stainless steels are very oxidizable, these steels {{can only be}} decarburized by reacting with dry hydrogen, which has no water content, unlike wet hydrogen, which is produced {{in a way that}} includes some water and can otherwise be used for <b>decarburization.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, ESCO {{expanded}} {{the manufacture of}} dragline and shovel dipper buckets and teeth. The company also launched a two-piece Conical tooth system and began using the argon oxygen <b>decarburization</b> (AOD) and vacuum molding processes. During the 1970s, ESCO opened an automated foundry in Newton, Mississippi and a second Canadian foundry in Ontario.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decarburization</b> can {{be either}} {{advantageous}} or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both {{something that can be}} done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step).|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to <b>decarburization.</b> This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce malleable cast iron, in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency to decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much <b>decarburization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{steel is}} one {{material}} that uses <b>decarburization</b> in its production. To prevent the atmospheric gases from reacting with the metal itself, electrical steel is annealed {{in an atmosphere}} of nitrogen, hydrogen, and water vapor, where oxidation of the iron is specifically prevented by the proportions of hydrogen and water vapor so that the only reacting substance is carbon being made into carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|Conventional and CPM steel-making smelts ore into steel with an {{electric}} arc furnace, refines it by removing some carbon, reducing it by removing the sulphur. Further refining may use argon oxygen <b>decarburization,</b> an implementation of powder metallurgy. The conventional process teems (distributes and pours) the steel into ingot molds. The steel slowly solidifies, allowing the elements to segregate into non-uniform patterns at the microscopic level.|$|E
50|$|In the 15th {{century the}} finery process, another process which shares the air-blowing {{principle}} with the Bessemer process, {{was developed in}} Europe. In 1740 Benjamin Huntsman developed the crucible technique for steel manufacture, at his workshop {{in the district of}} Handsworth in Sheffield. This process had an enormous impact on {{the quantity and quality of}} steel production, but it was unrelated to the Bessemer-type process employing <b>decarburization.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{manufacturing}} {{process can be}} characterized by the following key points: It is applied to low-carbon workpieces; workpieces are in contact with a high-carbon gas, liquid or solid; it produces a hard workpiece surface; workpiece cores largely retain their toughness and ductility; and it produces case hardness depths of up to 0.25 in. In some cases {{it serves as a}} remedy for undesired <b>decarburization</b> that happened earlier in a {{manufacturing process}}.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{typically}} used in metallurgy, describing {{the reduction of}} the content of carbon in metals (usually steel). <b>Decarburization</b> occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 °C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surface which are in contact with the decarburizing gas.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>decarburization</b> step is {{controlled}} by ratios of oxygen to argon or nitrogen to remove the carbon from the metal bath. The ratios {{can be done in}} any number of phases to facilitate the reaction. The gases are usually blown through a top lance (oxygen only) and tuyeres in the sides/bottom (oxygen with an inert gas shroud). The stages of blowing remove carbon by the combination of oxygen and carbon forming CO gas.|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} {{is essentially}} an improved version of the Bessemer process (<b>decarburization</b> by blowing oxygen as gas into the heat rather than burning the excess carbon away by adding oxygen carrying substances into the heat). The advantages of pure oxygen blast over air blast was known to Henry Bessemer, but the 19th-century technology was not advanced enough {{to allow for the}} production of the large quantities of pure oxygen to make it economically feasible for use.|$|E
5000|$|M2: M2 is the [...] "standard" [...] {{and most}} widely used {{industrial}} HSS. It has small and evenly distributed carbides giving high wear resistance, though its <b>decarburization</b> sensitivity {{is a little bit}} high. After heat treatment, its hardness is the same as T1, but its bending strength can reach 4700 MPa, and its toughness and thermo-plasticity are higher than T1 by 50%. It is usually used to manufacture a variety of tools, such as drill bits, taps and reamers.|$|E
50|$|If {{steel is}} exposed to {{hydrogen}} at high temperatures, hydrogen will diffuse into the alloy and combine with carbon to form tiny pockets of methane at internal surfaces like grain boundaries and voids. This methane does not diffuse out of the metal, and collects in the voids at high pressure and initiates cracks in the steel. This selective leaching process is known as hydrogen attack, or high temperature hydrogen attack and leads to <b>decarburization</b> of the steel and loss of strength and ductility.|$|E
50|$|A finery forge is a hearth used to fine (i.e., produce, refine) wrought iron, {{through the}} <b>decarburization</b> of the pig iron. The fining process {{involved}} liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Finery forges {{were used as}} early as 3rd century BC, based on archaeological evidence found at a site in Tieshengguo, China. The finery forge process {{was replaced by the}} puddling process and the roller mill, both developed by Henry Cort in 1783-4, but not becoming widespread until after 1800.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722-481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing <b>decarburization.</b> Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5000|$|When {{steel is}} heated to an austenizing temperature, the carbon begins to diffuse through the iron. The higher the temperature; {{the greater the}} rate of diffusion. At such high temperatures, carbon readily {{combines}} with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, so the carbon can easily diffuse out of the steel and into the surrounding air. By {{the end of a}} blacksmithing job, the steel will be of a lower carbon content than it was prior to heating. Therefore, most blacksmithing operations are done as quickly as possible to reduce <b>decarburization,</b> preventing the steel from becoming too soft.|$|E
50|$|Incidental <b>decarburization</b> can be {{detrimental}} to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative carburization, which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into {{the surface of the}} material during annealing. The decarburized surface material can also be removed using a grinding machine.|$|E

5000|$|... === Early life === Little {{is known}} of Cort's early life other than that he was {{possibly}} born in Lancaster, England although his parents are unknown. Although his date of birth is traditionally given as 1740, {{this can not be}} confirmed and his early life remains an enigma. By 1765, Cort had become a Royal Navy pay agent, acting on commission collecting half pay and widows' pensions from an office in Crutched Friars near Aldgate in London. At that time, despite Abraham Darby's improvements in the smelting of iron using coke instead of charcoal as blast furnace fuel, the resultant product was still only convertible to bar iron by a laborious process of <b>decarburization</b> in finery forges. As a result, bar iron imported from the Baltic undercut that produced in Britain, (increasingly from Russia) at considerable expense.|$|E
50|$|Forging: Unlike awase bocho, honyaki {{in general}} {{have no need}} to raise to forge welding heat. This skips the {{possible}} carbon migration to the mild steel and <b>decarburization</b> from the heating to around 1000 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the smith skips the need to weld the layers careful under careful heating and to evenly forge the core steel. In this regard to forging white 2 steel, honyaki is easier than in awase bocho. More alloy and higher carbon make this more difficult. There are multiple re-heatings and forging from high temperatures downward. Blades are cooled and annealed in carbonized rice straw or ash, cut to rough shape, cold forged, and corrected for distortion multiple times. They are preferably left to stabilize for a bit between each step to help reduce distortion. The knife is rough ground to shape with the omote, urasuki, and profile. These steps generally require more effort than with laminated knives.|$|E
50|$|Most {{grades of}} steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to {{extensive}} forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an {{electric arc furnace}} and alloying in an argon oxygen <b>decarburization</b> vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are cast into ingot molds. The solidified ingots then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.|$|E
