The storm and its profound impacts have prompted {{the discussion of}} constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area {{to minimize the risk}} of destructive consequences from another such event in the future. Around 15 percent of the borough is considered to be in flood-risk zones.|$|E

25|$|The natural nuclear {{reactors}} formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that {{acted as a}} neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place.

25|$|In the 20th century, many levees and dams {{were built}} on the San Joaquin {{and all of its}} major tributaries.

Once habitat <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> spawning salmon and millions of migratory birds, today the river is subject to tremendous water-supply, navigation and regulation works by various federal agencies, which have dramatically reduced the flow of the river since the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{symbiotic}} relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies, {{and many other}} companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. One such beneficiary was Jacob the Jeweler, a diamond merchant from New York. Jacob Arabo's clientele included Sean Combs, Lil' Kim and Nas. He created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. As his name was mentioned in the song lyrics of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose. Arabo expanded his brand to include gem-encrusted watches that retail <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> dollars, gaining so much attention that Cartier filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against him for putting diamonds {{on the faces of}} their watches and reselling them without permission. Arabo's profile increased steadily until his June 2006 arrest by the FBI on money laundering charges.|$|E
25|$|The {{radioactivity}} of all {{radioactive waste}} diminishes with time. All radionuclides {{contained in the}} waste have a half-life—the {{time it takes for}} half of the atoms to decay into another nuclide—and eventually all radioactive waste decays into non-radioactive elements (i.e., stable nuclides). Certain radioactive elements (such as plutonium-239) will remain hazardous to humans and other creatures <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> years. Other radionuclides remain hazardous for millions of years. Thus, these wastes must be shielded for centuries and isolated from the living environment for millennia. Since radioactive decay follows the half-life rule, the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay. In other words, the radiation from a long-lived isotope like iodine-129 will be much less intense than that of a short-lived isotope like iodine-131. The two tables show some of the major radioisotopes, their half-lives, and their radiation yield as a proportion of the yield of fission of uranium-235.|$|E
25|$|The second {{duty of the}} Council was {{to assist}} in Joseph Smith's 1844 {{campaign}} for President of the United States. Smith ran on a platform among church members of bringing restitution for land and property lost in Missouri, eliminating slavery, compensating slave-owners with the sale of private lands, reducing the salaries of members of Congress, eliminating debt imprisonment, etc. Members of the Council campaigned throughout the United States. Besides sending out hundreds of political missionaries to campaign for Smith throughout the U.S., they also appointed fellow members of the Fifty as political ambassadors to Russia, the Republic of Texas, Washington D.C., England, and France. However, Smith was murdered by a large mob {{in the midst of}} his presidential campaign. The campaign was meant to draw greater attention to the plight of the Mormons, who had received no state or federal restitution <b>for</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> dollars worth of property lost to mob violence in relation to the 1838 Mormon War. However, the Nauvoo Expositor incident, Smith's Presidential campaign, and even hyperbolic and inaccurate rumors about the Council of Fifty helped create the local unrest that led to his assassination.|$|E
