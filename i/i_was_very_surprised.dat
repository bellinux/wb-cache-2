500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day. Former Stoke {{teammate}} and current Sheffield United teammate Dave Kitson {{played a part in}} Higginbotham's move to Bramall Lane, Higginbotham stated on his move to the club: [...] "I was getting ready to go back to Ipswich on Sunday but after speaking to Dave I was optimistic something would be sorted here and thankfully it was... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ...

500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I made it very clear I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E

I was going to pass the lady without acknowledgment, for since my marriage she had never spoken to me, and I could well understand why she did not want to. To my astonishment she stopped me.|$|E
5000|$|After {{signing with}} AEK, Diop stated, [...] "I am very pleased signing for AEK, my {{expectations}} are to win trophies, AEK {{is a huge}} club who plays in Europe consistently. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> {{with the way the}} AEK fans greeted me at the Venizelos airport and I hope I can do my best for the club" ...|$|E
5000|$|César Isella's account then follows: In 1963, with Los Fronterizos, {{we went to}} Mendoza and met on {{the same}} day with Atahualpa Yupanqui and Armando Tejada Gómez, Oscar Matus, the painter Carlos Alonso, Tito France, and a skinny Tucumán lady, Matus's wife, Mercedes Sosa. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> that they sang a {{repertoire}} very different to what I knew, both melodically and poetically. Add contents to a music that until then was only descriptive. Their sound again amazed me, and I grabbed a crush on them. Cesar Isella.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} was controversial as many observers and boxing reporters {{felt that the}} underdog Ruiz had done enough to win. In interviews after the fight Ruiz said [...] "It was highway robbery without a gun,... I won the fight and he knows I won the fight...I had control of the fight. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> by the judges' decision. I don't know what fight they saw."

5000|$|.....My first {{encounter}} with the WA Ballet Company was very early in 1953 the year I arrived in Perth. Perth was at this time a very distant and sleepy town with out the cultural life that we were used to in Europe. There was no permanent Theatre. There was no permanent Musical Society or other such cultural and artistic organisations. When in November my relations {{told me that there}} was a Western Australian Ballet Company and they were to have a performance <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised.</b> I certainly had to go. It was on 15th November 1953. I went to His Majesty's Theatre and there was the performance. It was called Graduation Ball and in it were some gypsy dancers and scenes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to find in Graduation Ball and some other selected small numbers great similarity to the kind of Ballet-style I was used to in Europe. The similarity of the choreography of this school to my own school was because the choreographer Mrs Bousloff had been taught by the same teacher as me, Olga Preobrasjenska. Mrs Bousloff was firstly taught by Olga after I had finished being taught by her. So the age difference between us was very large. Madame Nadine was 16 years older than Madame Kira. I was pleased to learn this about Mrs Bousloff and wanted to get acquainted with her. After a while I did go and make her acquaintance and we became friends.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised.</b> I didn’t {{think they}} would stay in as good {{condition}} and have as much impact as they actually have. One story I remember from painting them was using a “flit” gun. We didn’t have airbrush in those days, {{and there was a}} lot of area to be covered. A flit gun is used to spray insecticide, but I dumped the insecticide out and used it to spray color. It had a pump action and a little bucket that hung suspended along the tube. I painted during art periods, spraying away, and the kids in the class, when they sneezed, they would sneeze in color.|$|E

"When I {{was in high}} school, I {{read and}} loved two {{wonderful}} novels by Megan McCafferty, Sloppy Firsts [...] and [...] Second Helpings, [...] which spoke {{to me in a}} way few other books did. Recently, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel ... and passages in these books ... While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasn't aware of how much I may have internalized Ms. McCafferty's words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious. My publisher and I plan to revise my novel for future printings to eliminate any inappropriate similarities ... I sincerely apologize to Megan McCafferty and to any who feel they have been misled by these unintentional errors on my part." ...|$|E

I do think she loves him and her heart is broken." [...] During May 2014 sweeps, Ava cheated on Morgan and had an affair with his father, Sonny. The pair slept together in a crypt. In an interview, West spoke about the events of the affair and its locale. She stated, [...] "A lot of people seemed shocked by it and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> by that reaction. I was never even thinking about the locale!

5000|$|All Blacks coach Laurie Mains {{conversely}} {{argues that}} the food poisoning {{was part of an}} orchestrated campaign of dirty tricks by the Springboks and their supporters.

You can read what you like into that, but I don't think it was coincidence. We certainly have our suspicions.... The chief operations executive of the investment group that owned the hotel, Helder Pereira, put the story into slightly different perspective, saying when asked that [...] "We warned against New Zealand players eating outside the hotel and made it known to them that we could not be held accountable. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to see the All Blacks and their management going out to eat on what was effectively the eve of the World Cup Final." ...|$|E

I have been looking for very long time to find something truly new in modern art. I found it here:Aesthetic and Beauty. So much new compared to what we normally see. I believe it is an adventure to be with this art. The translation of the word “Adventure” means you may be uncertain where you arrive. I think this is the invention of Ulli Kampelmann, to attract attention to one point, get the audience in communication with the art and then leave them alone to enjoy their trip through this adventure. Perhaps and this it the beauty of it; you immediately feel that Ulli Kampelmann has the intention to raise this question: What is beauty and harmony?."

5000|$|The episode also guest stars Regular Show {{storyboard}} artist Minty Lewis as the caterpillar Erin.

Unusually, the storyboard for [...] "Food Chain" [...] had been drawn and written out in a vertical, rather than horizontal format, as is common in the anime industry. In addition, the storyboard had been entirely written out in Japanese and then translated into English. Minty noted that [...] "it seemed like producers of Adventure Time put a lot of trust in Masaaki Yuasa to make something amazing without really understanding what he was doing until he was done." ...|$|E

We did a lot of Universities and places like the Sheffield Leadmill, middle-sized venues. I think the biggest thing we ever did when I was working for them was Brixton Academy, we weren't headlining that particular show but we did some big venues all over the place. The crowd response varied a lot, especially outside of the big cities. The big cities got Stump; Edinburgh, Glasgow, London and places like that got Stump, then you’d go to smaller cities and sometimes there was a bit of bafflement. It was like, what is this?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Young's own {{recollection}} {{was that}} {{the final version of}} [...] "Seven Bridges Road" [...] "was put together {{over a period of several}} years. Sometimes I'd say myself 'good song'.

5000|$|... "The Dangerous Kitchen", [...] "The Radio Is Broken", and [...] "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats" [...] all feature Zappa's [...] "meltdown" [...] {{style of}} {{generally}} pre-written but sometimes improvised singing/speaking. For [...] "Jazz" [...] and [...] "Kitchen", Zappa had guitarist Steve Vai overdub complex guitar parts {{for the entire}} length of the songs, which perfectly copied Zappa's every word and syllable. This unique type of overdub was a one-time experiment that Zappa never repeated. Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös said in an interview:"Dangerous Kitchen", off the album [...] "The Man From Utopia", grew to become a basic piece for me, especially in later years, after I began working on operas. The technique that he uses in this particular song is very interesting: it's this half-sung, half-spoken performing method that's not quite like Sprechgesang, but what makes it so interesting is that he accompanies it with an instrumental solo. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to find out that the guitar part was recorded separately.
