50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1939 by Alfred Carl (A.C.) Ferrell in Atchison, Kansas. Established as A.C. Ferrell Butane Gas Company, the {{business}} prospered during World War II and the immediate post-war years. The company sold gas heaters and <b>floor</b> <b>furnaces</b> from its storefront on Commercial Street in downtown Atchison. In 1947, A.C. Ferrell erected a bulk plant on a rail siding in East Atchison to help supply bottled gas to local customers. A.C.'s wife, Mabel, {{was active in the}} family business, serving as office manager and bookkeeper. The business began a slow, steady decline when Mabel died in 1952. The business continued on, with A.C. electing to diversify by selling furniture and televisions. A massive flood in Atchison in 1958 destroyed much of the company's merchandise, prompting A.C. to move the business from Commercial Street to rented space across the river in Missouri.|$|R

40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} {{floors are}} {{a combination of}} timber joists and concrete topping, creating a flooring system to best utilise the advantages each material has to offer. Timber is used as the main tensile load bearing material due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, while concrete is used in floor slabs for its advantages in stiffness and acoustic separation. The strength {{of the system is}} dependent on the connection between timber and concrete, thus the connection must be strong, stiff, and economical to manufacture, to ensure that the flooring system is economically viable. This research investigated the fire performance and failure behaviour of timber-concrete composite floor systems currently under development in New Zealand, resulting in a calculation method for evaluating the fire resistance of these <b>floors.</b> <b>Furnace</b> tests were performed on two full-size floor specimens at the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ). Both floor specimens were 4 m long and 3 m wide, consisting of 65 mm concrete topping on plywood formwork, connected to double LVL floor joists. They were tested over a 4 m span, subjected to a nominal design live load of 2. 5 kPa. Both floors were subjected to the ISO 834 test fire for over 60 minutes. Two separate connection types were tested; concrete notches cut into the timber beams with an incorporated shear key, and metal toothed plates pressed between the double beams. It was found that the reduction in section size of the timber beams due to the fire governed the failure mode of the floors. Due to the composite action achieved by the connections, the floor units were able to withstand prolonged exposure to the test fire, well exceeding one hour. The test data and visual observations aided {{in the development of a}} numerical model for evaluating the fire resistance of the floors. This was developed in a spreadsheet that is able to predict the expected fire resistance of these floors, taking into account some major time dependent variable properties that can have an effect on the overall performance. Load-span tables have been produced to give the estimated fire resistance of floors with differing floor dimensions, span lengths and applied loads...|$|R
50|$|Patrolman O.J.

There were several thousand gallons of liquor stored in various rooms, and pipes had been let down from the second <b>floor</b> to the <b>furnace</b> and a 350-gallon still. Ninety 50-gallon barrels of mashed were stored in each of the rooms on the second floor. Occupants were arrested on suspicion of violating prohibition laws.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary air}} {{register}} supplies primary air, {{which is the}} first to be introduced in the burner. Secondary air is added to supplement primary air. Burners may include a pre-mixer to mix the air and fuel for better combustion before introducing into the burner. Some burners even use steam as premix to preheat the air and create better mixing of the fuel and heated air. The <b>floor</b> of the <b>furnace</b> is mostly made of a different material from that of the wall, typically hard castable refractory to allow technicians to walk on its floor during maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A furnace can be {{lit by a}} small {{pilot flame}} or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames {{nowadays}} are lit by an ignition transformer (much like a car's spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both diesel and natural gas. When using liquid fuels, an atomizer is used, otherwise, the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the <b>furnace</b> <b>floor</b> and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (like a match).|$|R
50|$|Of {{the seven}} {{furnaces}} excavated at KM3, only furnace number 8, dated to 100 AD, has shown evidence of ritual modification. In the <b>furnace</b> <b>floor,</b> a small pit {{was discovered that}} contained a 6-cm-tall piece of prehistoric iron bloom, which was shown to have no relationship to the technological operation of the furnace. Later metallurgical analysis of the iron bloom shows evidence that the piece of iron had been produced by a smelting process that had formed large, dense, relatively slag-free bloom. The placement of this unprocessed iron in the pit evokes ethnographic comparison to iron smelting rituals that ensure the production of high-quality iron that mimics the attribute of the ritual device.|$|R
50|$|Insulation is an {{important}} part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as firebrick, castable refractories and ceramic fibre, are used for insulation. The <b>floor</b> of the <b>furnace</b> are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place. Ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its density and then its maximum temperature rating. For example, 8# 2,300 °F means 8 lb/ft3 density with a maximum temperature rating of 2,300 °F. The actual service temperature rating for ceramic fiber is a bit lower than the maximum rated temperature. (i.e. 2300 °F is only good to 2145 °F before permanent linear shrinkage).|$|R
50|$|The smelter site {{comprises}} four terraces {{with stone}} retaining walls, {{of which there}} are two main levels. The lowest level, or copper floor, contains a number of items of plant including four copper converter vessels and two converter hoods, a portable steam engine and an Aveling and Porter, Rochester steam traction engine. Below the upper level, or <b>furnace</b> <b>floor,</b> there is evidence of a long brick flue leading to the tall brick chimney which is octagonal in section. The chimney stands intact with some vertical shearing of brickwork around the top, probably as a result of lightning strikes. The power house site immediately east of the chimney contains concrete engine mounts, brick boiler foundations and the brick base of a metal chimney.|$|R
