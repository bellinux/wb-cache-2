25|$|In March 2003, AUPE faced {{what seemed}} to be another setback when the Alberta {{government}} introduced Bill 27, the Labour Relations (Regional Health Authorities Restructuring) Amendment Act, which forced amalgamation of <b>health</b> <b>region</b> bargaining units.

25|$|Saskatchewan medical {{health system}} has faced {{criticism}} {{due to a}} lack of accessibility to the midwifery program. According to Leanne Smith, the director for maternal services in the Saskatoon <b>Health</b> <b>Region</b> declared half of the women who apply for the midwifery program are turned away. Ministry of Health data shows midwives saw 1,233 clients in the 2012-13 fiscal year (which runs April to March). But in that fourth quarter, 359 women were still on waiting lists for immediate or future care. The provincial Health Ministry received 47 letters about midwifery services in 2012, most of which asked for more midwives. As a continuing problem in the Saskatchewan health care system, more pressure has been placed to recruit more midwives for the province.|$|E

40|$|RESUMO OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} breadth of care {{coordination}} by Primary Health Care in three <b>health</b> <b>regions.</b> METHODS This is a quantitative and qualitative case study. Thirty-one semi-structured interviews with municipal, regional and state managers were carried out, besides a cross-sectional survey with the administration of questionnaires to physicians (74), nurses (127), and {{a representative sample of}} users (1, 590) of Estratégia Saúde da Família (Family Health Strategy) in three municipal centers of <b>health</b> <b>regions</b> in the state of Bahia. RESULTS Primary Health Care as first contact of preference faced strong competition from hospital outpatient and emergency services outside the network. Issues related to access to and provision of specialized care were aggravated by dependence on the private sector in the regions, despite progress observed in institutionalizing flows starting out from Primary Health Care. The counter-referral system was deficient and interprofessional communication was scarce, especially concerning services provided by the contracted network. CONCLUSIONS Coordination capacity is affected both by the fragmentation of the regional network and intrinsic problems in Primary Health Care, which poorly supported in its essential attributes. Although the <b>health</b> <b>regions</b> have common problems, Primary Health Care remains a subject confined to municipal boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Liver {{cancer is}} not common in Canada in general; however, {{clustering}} {{of the disease}} causes a concern. We conducted a spatial analysis to determine the geographic variation of liver cancer and its association with the proportion of immigration in Ontario. Liver cancer incidence data between 1998 and 2002 {{were obtained from the}} Ontario Cancer Registry. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) in 2001 provided information on potential risk factors. Results Age standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for liver cancer and prevalence of potential risk factors were calculated for each of 35 <b>health</b> <b>regions.</b> The SIRs for liver cancer varied across the 35 <b>health</b> <b>regions</b> (p Conclusion Immigration is an important reason for the clustering of liver cancer in Ontario.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} spatial pattern of {{tuberculosis}} incidence {{in relation to}} the AIDS epidemic, with the aim of investigating the geographical influence on causality. METHODS: All AIDS cases from State of São Paulo, notified to the Brazilian Ministry of Health between 1991 and 2001, were included. The cases were stratified by municipality, by administrative <b>health</b> <b>regions,</b> AIDS transmission categories, gender and years since diagnosis. A Gaussian geostatistical model was used to construct a thematic risk map, utilizing the tuberculosis incidence among AIDS cases as the response variable. RESULTS: Exploratory analysis showed two patterns of AIDS incidence: one for the state capital, and another, with increasing risk, for the other municipalities. The more populous regions presented higher risk of tuberculosis transmission, with a pattern that matched the land occupation pattern, from east to west. The <b>health</b> <b>regions</b> with the highest AIDS incidence coefficients (per 10, 000 inhabitants) were Santos (53. 5), São José do Rio Preto (43. 1), Ribeirão Preto (42. 4) and São Paulo (40. 3). The <b>health</b> <b>regions</b> with greatest tuberculosis incidence among AIDS cases were Santos (44. 9 %), Franco da Rocha (39. 9 %), Osasco (39. 6 %) and São Paulo (38. 9 %).
