5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanism</b> is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as ion chromatography) uses an ion <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanism</b> to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the exchangeable ion is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the exchangeable ion is an anion. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, Japan {{had already}} become an {{important}} ally in the Western defense system as dominated by the US. To foster closer ties with other allies of the US, Hayashi paid several visits to some of these countries. In particular, he paid a visit to the United Kingdom (UK) under the invitation of the British government from 5 to 16 May 1957, during which he visited the British Armed Forces and their facilities in London and other places. It was the first formal visit of a senior Japanese general officer to the UK since 1937, when Lieutenant-General Masaharu Homma attended the coronation ceremony of King George VI. After visiting the UK, Hayashi arrived at Bonn, West Germany on 21 May 1957. On the following day, he met Franz Josef Strauss, Federal Minister of Defense, and Generalleutnant Adolf Heusinger, Inspector General of the Bundeswehr. It was the first post-war meeting between military chiefs of Japan and Germany and they achieved productive agreements on building a military <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanism.</b> On 14 and 15 November 1959, Hayashi attended a multinational military conference as hosted by Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander of the US Pacific Command, at Baguio, the Philippines. During his stay, he met Lieutenant-General Manuel F. Cabal, Chief of Staff of the Philippines, General Peng Meng-chi, Chief of the General Staff of the Republic of China, as well as other military chiefs from member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with a view to fostering stronger military ties with countries in the Western Pacific Region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{pre-shared key}} based {{mechanisms}} for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were recently standardized by the IETF {{to extend the}} set of ciphersuites by utilizing existing key management infrastructures. The benefit of pre-shared based mechanisms is the avoidance or reduction of the cryptographic operations used in public-key based mechanisms. However, so far there are no performance measurements for pre-shared key based ciphersuites available. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis and performance comparison between the pre-shared key <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the standard public key <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in TLS. Our performance metrics are processing time and transmitted amount of data for a handshake establishment. Furthermore, {{the interaction between the}} overall TLS handshake duration and the network environment is evaluated. The results for different key <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are comparatively studied and the design choices of pre-shared key based key <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been validated. Experimental results give details about the performance improvement of the preshared key based mechanisms compared to the standard public key based mechanisms. I...|$|R

It is important for firms to co-create value with customers/suppliers while pursuing supply chain innovation. However, few studies have investigated {{identification is}}sues from the business-to-business aspects. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the identification generation among supply chain members, especially focus on the <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of identification.

40|$|Thermal {{tolerance}} {{has been}} hypothesized {{to result from}} a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. However, the generality of this hypothesis has been challenged by studies on various animal groups, including air-breathing adult insects. Recently, comparisons across taxa have suggested that differences in gas <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could reconcile the discrepancies found in previous studies. Here, we test this suggestion by comparing the behaviour of related insect taxa with different gas <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> with and without access to air. We demonstrate oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in air-breathing adults of the plastron-exchanging water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis. Ilyocoris cimicoides, a related, bimodal gas exchanger, did not exhibit such oxygen-limited thermal tolerance and relied increasingly on aerial gas exchange with warming. Intriguingly, however, when denied access to air, oxygen-limited thermal tolerance could also be induced in this species. Patterns in oxygen-limited thermal tolerance {{were found to be}} consistent across life-history stages in these insects, with nymphs employing the same gas <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as adults. These results advance our understanding of oxygen limitation at high temperatures; differences in the degree of respiratory control appear to modulate the importance of oxygen in setting tolerance limits...|$|R

An {{e-market}} {{system is}} a concrete implementation of a market institution; it embeds one or more <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> E-market systems are also information systems which are {{information and communication technologies}} artifacts. This work puts forward an argument that the study of e-markets must incorporate both the behavioral economics as well as the information systems perspectives. To this end the paper proposes a conceptual framework that integrates the two. This framework is used to formulate a model, which incorporates the essential features of <b>exchange</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as their implementations as is artefacts. The focus of attention is on two classes of mechanisms, namely auctions and negotiations. They both may serve the same purpose and their various types have been embedded in many e-market systems...|$|R
