25|$|This feature <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> Animal {{communication}} systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, {{but not one}} is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, {{in the case of}} animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.|$|E

25|$|Acari (or Acarina) are a taxon of arachnids that {{contains}} mites and ticks. The {{diversity of the}} Acari <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and its fossil history goes back to at least the early Devonian period. As a result, acarologists (the people who study mites and ticks) have proposed {{a complex set of}} taxonomic ranks to classify mites. In most modern treatments, the Acari is considered a subclass of Arachnida and is composed of two or three superorders or orders: Acariformes (or Actinotrichida), Parasitiformes (or Anactinotrichida), and Opilioacariformes; the latter is often considered a subgroup within the Parasitiformes. The monophyly of the Acari is open to debate, and the relationships of the acarines to other arachnids is not at all clear. In older treatments, the subgroups of the Acarina were placed at order rank, but as their own subdivisions have become better understood, it is more usual to treat them at superorder rank.|$|E

Their analysis was also that [...] "Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary</b> beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly".

Some of the carriages are highly decorative, being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels. [...] Those used on the grandest occasions, such as the [...] "Carrozza d'Oro" [...] (golden carriage), are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station of the carriage's occupants. [...] Other carriages on view are those used by the King of the Two Sicilies, and Archbishops and other Florentine dignitaries.|$|E
500|$|Angel {{has said}} that, [...] "I {{stayed away from}} magicians when I was younger because I didn't want to think like them and wanted to create my own style." [...] His first {{television}} appearance was in 1994, where he performed {{as a part of}} a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled Secrets. One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director Clive Barker. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film Lord of Illusions. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album World of Illusion: System One. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, [...] "Criss Angel <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary,</b> a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can’t come quickly enough." [...] During that year, he collaborated with musician Klayton to form Angeldust, a show that combined magic with music. They released their first album Musical Conjurings from the World of Conjuring in 1998. Also that year, Angel performed a ten-minute show over the course of the [...] "World of Illusion" [...] conference in Madison Square Garden, performing sixty shows per day. However, by 2000, Klayton's name was removed from Angel's website.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} return of American actress Megan Dodds, who first {{appeared}} {{in a handful of}} scenes in the first episode of the first series. The producers enjoyed the actress' company, and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series. Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips; it allows the audience to see what happens to her since her sacking in the first series finale. The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker. The producers needed another [...] "interesting, strong" [...] member of the team following Tessa's departure. The character also came from GCHQ in the series; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70,000 people, and the producers did not want to ignore this aspect of British intelligence gathering. Describing Walker's casting, producer Jane Featherstone recalled [...] "Nicola <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary</b> in it. I think she's completely brilliant. And she's developed that and I think once Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part, and she's really made it her own." [...] The character was created by Brenton. Her introduction depicted her as clumsy, mirroring the writer.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 5, 2017, Dylan's Nobel Lecture {{was posted}} on the Nobel prize website.

[...] Academy secretary Danius commented: [...] "The speech <b>is</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close." [...] In his essay, Dylan writes about the impact that three important books made on him: Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Homer's The Odyssey. He concludes: [...] "Our songs are alive {{in the land of the}} living. But songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare’s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story'." [...] Alan Pasqua provided the uncredited piano accompaniment for the recorded speech.|$|E

Rhimes noted that his return, unlike previous ones, were as Death and caused him to wear black clothes and speak sparingly.
