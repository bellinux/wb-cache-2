This group of proteins as purified by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography has been given the trivial name `patatin. ' Patatin exists in a number of charge forms which differ between potato cultivars and in some cases can also be resolved into a number of bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, {{it was found that the}} isoforms of patatin are immunologically identical both within a cultivar as well as between cultivars.

40|$|Canadian {{oil sand}} bitumen was {{stepwise}} converted via an integrated cracking and coke gasification (ICCG) process. The cracking behaviors of oil sand bitumen were investigated in a fluidized bed reactor with FCC and bifunctional (BFC) catalysts, respectively. The BFC catalyst specialized for the ICCG process was designed with both cracking and gasification activities. The {{results showed that}} the liquid yield of 78 wt % and conversion ratio of 87 % of oil cracking could be simultaneously realized over hydrothermally treated catalysts (A-FCC and A-BFC) at 510 degrees C. The cracking performance of catalysts was closely related with their acidity, as <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 3 -TPD analysis. Coke deposit on the catalyst could lead to severe pore blockage. Catalyst regeneration via coke gasification could recover its pore structures and meanwhile produce high quality syngas with the sum of H- 2 and CO up to 80 vol %. Comparing with FCC catalysts, the regeneration. (coke gasification) time over BFC catalysts was shortened by about 30 % due to its well-developed pores and high alkaline oxides content, and these effects could be further enhanced by impregnating potassium oxides as catalytic additives. Finally, the alternating cracking gasification operation was conducted for four cycles to justify the stability of BFC catalyst. The newly designed amorphous BFC catalyst exhibited high hydrothermal stability and could be potentially used for oil sand bitumen upgrading via the ICCG process in a large scale...|$|E
40|$|Iron-containing {{mesoporous}} {{molecular sieves}} (Fe-MCM- 41) synthesized by both direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) {{methods have been}} characterized and used as catalysts for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with diluted H 2 O 2. The characterizations with XRD, diffuse reflectance UV-vis, ESR, and EXAFS suggest that iron cations are highly dispersed and tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen in the DHT samples with iron content lower than ca. 0. 9 - 1. 1 wt% (Si/Fe = 105 - 86). This coordination environment {{is similar to that}} in a ferrisilicate zeolite with MFI structure and contributes to the increase in relative strong acidic sites, as <b>indicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 3 -TPD studies. On the other hand, the TIE samples mainly contain small iron oxide clusters. The conversion of styrene over the DHT catalyst increases significantly with increasing iron content up to 1. 1 wt%. The selectivity to styrene oxide and the efficiency of H 2 O 2 for the epoxidation can be improved by adding H 2 O 2 slowly to keep the H 2 O 2 concentration low during the reaction. As compared with the DHT catalyst, the TIE catalyst shows a much poorer performance for the epoxidation of styrene. It is suggested that the atomically isolated iron sites account for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM- 41 do not leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters leach out into the liquid phase and do not contribute to the catalytic reaction.

40|$|The {{effects of}} agro-industrial {{byproducts}} as additives on fermentation characteristics and nutritional quality of elephant grass were reviewed. PH value, NH 3 -N/TN, lactic acid, acetic acid and butyric acid contents {{were used to}} evaluate fermentation quality, while crude protein, NDF, ADF, cellulose and hemicellulose contents were {{used to evaluate the}} nutritional quality of elephant grass silage.

40|$|Nitrogenase {{activity}} in Rhodospirillum rubrum was inhibited <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 4 + more rapidly in low light than in high light. Furthermore, the nitrogenase of cells exposed to phosphorylation uncouplers was inhibited <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 4 + {{more rapidly than}} was the nitrogenase of controls without an uncoupler. These observations suggest that high levels of photosynthate inhibit the nitrogenase inactivation system. L-Methionine-DL-sulfoximine, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, prevented NH 4 + from inhibiting nitrogenase activity, which suggests that NH 4 + must be processed at least to glutamine for inhibition to occur. An inhibitor of glutamate synthase activity, 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-L-norleucine, inhibited nitrogenase {{activity in}} the absence of NH 4 +, but only in cells exposed to low light. The mechanism of 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-L-norleucine inhibition appeared to be the same as that induced <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 4 +, because nitrogenase activity could be restored in vitro by activating enzyme and Mn 2 +. The inhibitor data suggest that the glutamine pool or a molecule that responds to it activates the Fe protein-modifying (or protein-inactivating) system and that the accumulation of this (unidentified) molecule is retarded when the cells are exposed to high light. It was confirmed here that Anabaena nitrogenase is also inhibited <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 4 +, but only when the cells are incubated under low light. This inhibition, however, unlike that in R. rubrum, could be completely reversed in high light, suggesting that the mechanisms of nitrogenase inhibition <b>by</b> <b>NH</b> 4 + in these two phototrophs are different...|$|R

Trees exposed to NH 3 + O 3 maintained a less negative needle-water potential after a drought treatment, indicating an ameliorative effect of O 3 on drought sensitivity although the relative decrease in water potential during the drought treatment was larger than in trees exposed to only NH 3.
