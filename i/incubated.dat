5|$|Hamilton Zoo, Auckland Zoo and Wellington Zoo also breed tuatara {{for release}} into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was {{discovered}} that the temperature at which the eggs are <b>incubated</b> determines the sex of the animal.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , {{roughly the size of}} a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are <b>incubated</b> by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and <b>incubated</b> for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|E
50|$|In {{the species}} that <b>incubate,</b> the work is divided {{differently}} between the sexes. Possibly the most common pattern is that the female does all the incubation, as in the canary and the Indian robin, or most of it, as is typical of falcons. In some species, such as the whooping crane, the male and the female take turns <b>incubating</b> the egg. In others, such as the cassowaries, only the male <b>incubates.</b> The male mountain plover <b>incubates</b> the female's first clutch, but if she lays a second, she <b>incubates</b> it herself. In hoatzins, some birds (mostly males) help their parents <b>incubate</b> later broods.|$|R
50|$|Both sexes help <b>incubate</b> the egg. During the {{shifting}} of parental care, the partner perches near the <b>incubating</b> adult and carefully slides over the nest.|$|R

5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are <b>incubated</b> by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{reproduce}} {{all throughout}} the year, with peak {{seasons in the}} summer months. Males are highly aggressive and exhibit sexual competition over the smaller females. The eggs, which average at 40 per female, are <b>incubated</b> for about 5 days at 22C in the female's brood pouch. Upon hatching, they reach sexual maturity in about 21 to 46 days. Their average lifespan in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
5|$|Measuring , {{the eggs}} are oval, smooth and lustreless white, with small spots or blotches of red on the larger end. The clutch size is {{reported}} to be two or three eggs. While there is no reliable information on incubation and feeding, it is believed that both parents are active in caring for the young. A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone <b>incubated</b> eggs.|$|E

50|$|Ratites are {{different}} from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young. First and foremost is the thickness of the shells of their eggs. Their young are hatched more developed than most and they can run or walk soon thereafter. Also, most ratites have communal nests, where they share the <b>incubating</b> duties with others. Ostriches are the only ratites where the female incubates; they share the duties, with the males <b>incubating</b> at night. Cassowaries and emu are polyandrous, with males <b>incubating</b> eggs and rearing chicks with no obvious contribution from females. Ostriches and rheas are polygynous with each male courting several females. Male rheas are responsible for building nests and <b>incubating</b> while ostrich males <b>incubate</b> only at night. Kiwis stand out as the exception with extended monogamous reproductive strategies where either the male alone or both sexes <b>incubate</b> a single egg. Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.|$|R
25|$|Both sexes {{contribute}} to the nesting process, namely excavating, <b>incubating</b> the eggs, brooding and feeding the offspring. However females spend more time brooding, since they alone <b>incubate</b> and brood at night. Males {{on the other hand}} contribute more to providing the chicks with food. During the day the pair will take it in turns to brood although they have been known to <b>incubate</b> together.|$|R
5|$|The {{eggs are}} <b>incubated</b> by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed {{initially}} by the male, both parents sharing the duty {{after a few}} days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is <b>incubated</b> by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was <b>incubated</b> with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|The <b>incubating</b> bees do {{not have}} a target {{temperature}} for their broods. They will continue to <b>incubate</b> broods despite the ambient temperature. At 30 °C, the queen will <b>incubate</b> the eggs, even though at 10 °C, she only raises the brood temperature to 26 °C. However, it has been observed that the amount of thermogeneration that occurs at the abdomen is reduced when the ambient temperatures are greater.|$|R
40|$|WOS:A 1996 UE 04800013 International audienceThe role {{of ovarian}} hormones in the {{expression}} of parental behavior and in the regulation of LH secretion was investigated in <b>incubating</b> commercial meat-type hens. After ovariectomy, <b>incubating</b> hens continued to <b>incubate</b> eggs normally and brooded day-old chicks given to replace eggs, {{in a manner similar}} to sham-ovariectomized control hens. The concentration of plasma LH increased significantly in <b>incubating</b> hens after ovariectomy while the concentration of plasma prolactin remained high. Plasma LH remained depressed in sham-ovariectomized <b>incubating</b> control hens. The increase in plasma LH in <b>incubating</b> hens after ovariectomy (3. 92 +/- 0. 7 ng/ml) was less than that following the ovariectomy of nonincubating, nonlaying hens (5. 3 +/- 1. 2 ng/ml). The two groups of hens differed in that plasma prolactin concentrations were high (527 +/- 7. 4 ng/ml) in the <b>incubating</b> hens and low (70 +/- 9 ng/ml) in the nonincubating hens. Nest deprivation resulted in an increase in plasma LH in both ovariectomized and sham-ovariectomized <b>incubating</b> hens with a significantly larger increase occurring in the ovariectomized hens (8. 5 +/- 1. 41 ng/ml compared to 2. 48 +/- 0. 65 ng/ml). Nest deprivation resulted in a similar rapid decrease in plasma prolactin in both ovariectomized and sham-ovariectomized hens. Replacement of eggs with day-old chicks in ovariectomized or sham-ovariectomized <b>incubating</b> hens resulted in a rapid decrease in plasma prolactin and after 6 days, in an increase in plasma LH in the ovariectomized but not sham-operated hens. It is concluded that once incubation behavior is established, ovarian hormones are not required for its maintenance or the readiness to brood day-old chicks. Ovarian hormones do, however, suppress LH release during incubation while the high concentration of plasma prolactin supplements this suppression. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} uses {{in vitro}} biological assays such as PCR-ELISA or Fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, {{that is a}} marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. Preservation of the sample before analysis is critical. Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it is vulnerable to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or <b>incubated</b> in preservation agents.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are <b>incubated</b> for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are <b>incubated</b> for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat.|$|E

50|$|They build cup nests on loose twig {{platforms}} wedged behind {{patches of}} bark on tree trunks. (They will also use special nest boxes clamped to tree trunks and made with two openings; the birds use one as an entrance and one as an exit.) They lay 3 to 9 eggs (usually 5 or 6), which are white with reddish-brown speckles and dots. The female <b>incubates</b> for 14 or 15 days. The young fledge 15 or 16 days later; the male may {{care for them}} while the female <b>incubates</b> and feeds a second brood. Rarely a male may mate with a second female while the first is <b>incubating,</b> and there are even records of two females <b>incubating</b> their clutches {{side by side in}} a nest.|$|R
50|$|Temminck's stints have an {{intriguing}} breeding and parental {{care system in}} which males and female parents <b>incubate</b> separate clutches, typically in different locations. Males establish small territories and mate with a female who lays a first clutch of eggs. She then moves to a second territory and mate, and lays a second clutch that she <b>incubates</b> herself. Concurrently, her first male may mate with an incoming second female, who lays her second clutch on his territory. The male thereafter <b>incubates</b> his first mate's first clutch alone.|$|R
5|$|The clutch is {{typically}} {{three to five}} eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are <b>incubated</b> for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, {{building its}} compact, three-layered nest {{on a tree}} branch. Ten to twelve eggs are <b>incubated</b> by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and population mean {{that it is not}} considered to present any significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is <b>incubated</b> for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, {{although there has been}} a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{were removed}} from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and {{maintained}} in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into in situ captivity, where females produced 42eggs, which were <b>incubated</b> at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.|$|E

5|$|The female {{develops}} a brood patch of bare skin and plays {{the main part}} in <b>incubating</b> the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly <b>incubate</b> them. The female spends the night <b>incubating</b> during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9.
