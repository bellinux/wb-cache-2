40|$|The human {{organism}} is permanently {{exposed to}} various environmental factors, which influence its performance, e. g. climatic conditions, nutrition intake behavior or air quality. This thesis {{focuses on the}} human exposure to particulate matter. The “Augsburger Umweltstudie” (2007 – 2008) was conducted at the KORA study center in Augsburg and aimed at {{the investigation of the}} association between particulate matter and human health. An accompanying validation study was conducted in 2011 in order to collect information about the errors in the measurement of particulate matter. The complexity of these errors arises from different data sources: 1.) The usage of population-specific <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements,</b> e. g. from one or several fixed site measurement stations, instead of personal measurements involves a Berkson type error. The deviations between personal and populations–specific measurements are driven by the microenvironment of the person and the climatic conditions. In {{the first part of the}} work, a two–level exposure model is developed for the association between the fixed–site and the personal <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> of the validation study including the selection of relevant covariates and the appropriate consideration of categorical covariates in the analysis of longitudinal data. 2.) The mobile devices used for personal <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> exhibit classical measurement error, which is partially device–specific and autocorrelated. 3.) In order to use as much information as possible missing personal <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> are filled in with population–specific <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> resulting in a mixture of Berkson and classical measurement error. The second part of the work aims at the development and application of methods to include knowledge about Berkson, classical and mixture error into regression models of the health outcome. Therefore, the method–of–moments is extended to longitudinal data and to the different types of errors with individual–specific and autocorrelated structures. Validation studies and expert knowledge provide information about the size of the measurement error, but prior knowledge is often afflicted with uncertainty. Approaches for the adequate inclusion of prior knowledge about the measurement errors in the Bayesian health outcome model are evaluated in the third part of the thesis. The role of prior knowledge in regression models with an error–prone covariate differs from conventional Bayesian regression models and is strongly affected by the interaction between the parameters in the model. The thesis is closed with the application of the developed method–of–moments and Bayesian approach to the Augsburger Umweltstudie by integrating information from the validation studies...|$|R
50|$|Credit risk {{managers}} have traditionally remained focused on current <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> (i.e., current mark-to-market exposure, plus outstanding receivables) and collateral management. The {{problem with this}} focus is that it places excessive emphasis on the present and fails to provide an acceptable indication of credit risk {{at some point in}} the future. Because losses from credit risk take a relatively long time to evolve, a more useful measure of exposure is potential exposure. Potential exposure is not like current exposure. It exists in the future and therefore represents a range or distribution of outcomes rather than a single point estimate.|$|E

50|$|However, {{what makes}} the Pellix special, is that the TTL {{metering}} is accomplished using a stationary semitransparent pellicle reflex mirror instead of the traditional moving SLR mirror and placing a CdS meter cell behind it for the TTL <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement.</b> The cell, attached to an arm is swung {{up in front of}} the film gate using the stop down lever on the right-hand camera front, reading the light projected from the camera lens after passing through the semitransparent mirror. Very few alternative locations inside the camera were available for picking up light rays from the camera lens. The Topcon RE Super has its meter cell placed directly behind the reflex mirror into which a pattern of slits are cut to let the light though, while the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic has a pair of cells located either side of the finder window reading light off the focusing screen.|$|E

40|$|Many {{workers are}} daily exposed to {{chemical}} risks {{in their work}} place {{that has to be}} assessed and controlled. Due to exposure variability, repeated and random measurements should be conducted for valid estimates of the average exposure. Traditionally, experts such as safety engineers, work environment inspectors, and occupational hygienists, have performed the measurements. In self assessment of exposure (SAE), the workers perform unsupervised <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> of chemical agents. This thesis studies a prerequisite for SAE, i. e. the workers’ mental models of chemical exposure. Further, the workers’ mental models are contrasted with experts’ reasons and decision criteria for measurement. Both qualitative and quantitative data generated from three studies (Paper I, II, and III) were used to describe the workers’ mental model of chemical exposure. SAE was introduced to workers in three different industries; transports (benzene), sawmill industry (monoterpenes), and reinforced plastic industry (styrene). By interviews, qualitative data were collected on the workers’ interpretation of measurement results and preventive actions. To evaluate the validity of worker measurement, the measurements were compared with expert measurements. The association between each worker’s number of performed measurement and mean level and variability in exposure concentrations was calculated. Mean absolute percent/forecast error (MAPE) was used to assess whether the workers’ decision models were in accordance with a coherence or correspondence model. In Paper IV, experts (safety engineers, work environment inspectors, and occupational hygienists) were interviewed to elucidate their mental models about the triggers and decision criteria for <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements.</b> The results indicate that the workers’ measurement results were in agreement with experts’. However, the measurement results were not a strong enough signal to induce workers to take preventive actions and sustained <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> even if the measurement result were close to the occupational exposure limit. The fit was best for the median model, indicating that the workers’ mental models for interpretation of measurement data can best be described by the coherence theory rather than by the correspondence theory. The workers seemed to mentally reduce the variation in the exposure to a measure of central tendency (the median), and underestimated the average exposure level. The experts were found to directly take preventive actions instead of performing <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements.</b> When they performed <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements,</b> a worst case sampling strategy was most common. An important trigger for measurement for the experts was “request from the employer” (safety engineers), “legal demands” (work environment inspectors), and “symptoms among workers” (occupational hygienists). When there was a trigger, all experts mentioned expectations of high exposure level as a decision criterion for measurements. In conclusion, the studies suggest that workers’ mental interpretation model is best described in terms of a coherence model rather than a model of correspondence. The workers reduced the variation mentally in favor of an estimate of average exposure (median), which may imply that they underestimate short-term, high exposure health risks. A consequence is that interpretation of measurements such as SAE cannot be given to the individual worker without some support, e. g. from an expert. However, experts often chose to directly take preventive actions, without measuring the exposure. The results indicate that also the experts need support e. g. from the legal system if <b>exposure</b> <b>measurements</b> are to be done...|$|R
50|$|The first {{camera to}} employ the {{pellicle}} mirror as a beam splitter was the Canon Pellix, launched by Canon Camera Company Inc. Japan in 1965. The object was to accomplish <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> through the lens (TTL), which was pioneered by Tokyo Kogaku KK, Japan in the 1963 Topcon RE Super. That employed a CdS meter cell placed behind the reflex mirror that had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell. Canon improved on the idea by making the mirror semi-translucent and fixed. The meter cell was swung into the light-path behind the mirror by operating a lever on the right-hand camera front for stopped down exposure reading, momentarily dimming the viewfinder. Two thirds of {{the light from the}} camera lens was let through the mirror, while the rest was reflected up to the viewfinder screen. The Pellix pellicle mirror was an ultra-thin (0.02 mm) Mylar film with a vapour deposited semi reflecting layer. Since there was no mirror blackout, the user could see the image at the moment of exposure.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} goal of many epidemiological studies is {{to estimate the}} magnitude of association between an exposure and an outcome. <b>Exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error causes bias in such estimates of association and can be substantial.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{describes}} 2 {{statistical methods}} designed to correct for bias from <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error in point and interval estimates of relative risk. METHODS: The first method takes the usual point and interval {{estimates of the}} log relative risk obtained from logistic regression and corrects them for nondifferential measurement error using an <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error model estimated from validation data. The second, likelihood-based method fits an arbitrary measurement error model suitable for the data at hand and then derives {{the model for the}} outcome of interest. RESULTS: Data from Valanis and colleagues' study of the health effects of antineoplastics exposure among hospital pharmacists were used to estimate the prevalence ratio of fever in the previous 3 months from this exposure. For an interdecile increase in weekly number of drugs mixed, the prevalence ratio, adjusted for confounding, changed from 1. 06 to 1. 17 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 04, 1. 26) after correction for <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error.

The spectral response approximates the CIE erythemal action spectrum between 300 and 340 nm, with a peak response at 305 nm. A large deviation from this action spectrum was observed at shorter wavelengths. Investigation of the angular response in both the azimuth and altitude planes showed a cosine error of less than 6. 2 % between 0 ° and 40 °, and did not exceed 13. 3 % at any angle greater than 40 °.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the structure, functionalities, {{and content of the}} Advanced REACH Tool (ART) exposure database (version 1. 5). The incorporation of the exposure database into ART allows users who do not have their own measurement data for their exposure scenario, to update the exposure estimates produced by the mechanistic model using analogous measurement series selected from the ART <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> database. Depending on user input for substance category and activity (sub) classes, the system selects <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> series from the exposure database. The comprehensive scenario descriptions and summary statistics assist the user in deciding if the measurement series are indeed fully analogous. After selecting one or more analogous data sets, the data are used by the Bayesian module of the ART system to update the mechanistically modeled exposure estimates. The 1944 exposure measurements currently stored in the ART <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> database cover 9 exposure situations for handling solid objects (n = 65), 42 situations for handling powders, granules, or pelletized material (n = 488), 5 situations for handling low-volatility liquids (n = 88), 35 situations for handling volatile liquids (n = 870), and 26 situations for handling liquids in which powders are dissolved or dispersed (resulting in exposure to mist) (n = 433). These 117 measurement series form a good basis for supporting user exposure estimates. However, by increasing the diversity of exposure situations and the number of measurement series in the database, the usefulness of the ART system will be further improved. Suggestions to stimulate the process of sharing <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> data both to increase the available data in the ART and for other purposes are made...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Studies in air {{pollution}} epidemiology may suffer from some specific forms of confounding and <b>exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error. This contribution discusses these, {{mostly in the}} framework of cohort studies. Evaluation of potential confounding is critical in studies of the health effects of {{air pollution}}. The association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mortality has been investigated using cohort studies in which subjects are followed over time with respect to their vital status. In such studies, control for individual-level confounders such as smoking is important, as is control for area-level con-founders such as neighborhood socio-economic status. In addition, there may be spatial dependencies in the survival data that need to be addressed. These issues are illustrated using the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II cohort. <b>Exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error is a challenge in epidemiology because inference about health effects can be incorrect when the measured or predicted exposure used in the analysis is different from the underlying true exposure. Air pollution epidemiology rarely if ever uses personal measurements of exposure for reasons of cost and feasibility. <b>Exposure</b> <b>measurement</b> error in air pollution epidemiology comes in various dominant forms, which are different for time-series and cohort studies. The challenges are reviewed and a number of suggested solutions are discussed for both study domains...|$|E
