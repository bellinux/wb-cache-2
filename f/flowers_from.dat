5|$|Flower {{production}} {{is related to}} increasing day length, and in general, plants produced the most <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> December to March. Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production of flowers outside these months.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Bian Koen and Roosminah {{live with}} their two {{children}} at the plantation Aij Tjeng used to manage. While Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio are visiting, their granddaughter Elsy (guided by Marsiti's spirit) brings them <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> a tree Marsiti had planted.

5|$|In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, {{is called}} a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart {{from the village of}} Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from heaven to please his wife Satyabhama.|$|E

5|$|On 5 April 1972, Molde Airport, Årø opened. Unlike other primary airports, it {{had been}} built and financed by the municipality, and did not become {{state-owned}} until 1978. Braathens SAFE started flying both to Oslo and along the West Coast from Molde. The same year, the airline {{for the first time}} exceeded one million domestic passengers. It also started with five weekly cargo flights with <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> Genova, Italy. The following year, the last DC-6 was sold, after the type had been phased out since 1969.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from <b>flowers,</b> <b>from</b> which they obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, {{attracted by the}} salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E

5|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season this takes the form of a powerful goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E
5|$|Fumiya is a talkative boy {{one year}} older than Saori whom she meets when she starts going to church. Saori is easily annoyed by him, {{especially}} when he brings her <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> his parents' flower shop. He takes an early interest in Saori and tries to become her boyfriend. After meeting Shuichi, Fumiya becomes jealous of Saori's interest in Shuichi, and finds Shuichi's cross-dressing gross. While initially lying to Saori and Shuichi about having an interest in cross-dressing, he is later seen dressed as a girl while out with Shuichi, and again at the cultural festival at Shuichi's school. Fumiya enjoys the added attention that comes from cross-dressing and admits that he likes being called cute.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Claire goes on {{a miserable}} double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan (Travis Schuldt), and his ill-mannered friend Benny (Bailey Chase). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear {{as if she had}} {{requested}} this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plants are}} {{immediately}} evident to the visitor. Banyan (Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris) {{is a remarkable}} tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots: {{it can be seen}} on the track to Clear Place and near Ned's Beach. Pandanus tree (Pandanus forsteri) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas like creek beds and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. There are ten species of orchid on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (Dendrobium macropus subsp. howeanum) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream <b>flowers</b> <b>from</b> August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (Metrosideros nervulosa and Metrosideros sclerocarpa), the massed small yellow flowers of corokia (Corokia carpodetoides), orange plump flowers of pumpkin tree (Negria rhabdothamnoides), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain the endemic glowing mushrooms Mycena chlorophanos and Omphalotus nidiformis {{can be found in the}} palm forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{season after}} Given's arrival saw Blackburn win the Premier League title and Given {{was unable to}} oust first-choice goalkeeper and England {{international}} Tim <b>Flowers</b> <b>from</b> the team. He made two loan moves to Swindon Town. Given acted as understudy during his first spell at the Wiltshire club but helped them start their Championship winning Division Two campaign during the 1995–96 season. He played in five games for Swindon before returning to Blackburn {{at the end of}} 1995. Given was sent on loan again in January 1996, this time to Division One side Sunderland. Given kept 12 clean sheets during his 17 games for the club, and formed part of the team who won promotion to the Premier League as champions. His performances on loan impressed Kenny Dalglish, who had recently been appointed manager of Newcastle United, and prompted him to sign Given again. Given signed for the North-East club in the summer of 1997 for a fee of £1.5million. Given had earlier made his Premier League debut for Blackburn in a game against Wimbledon on 14 December 1996.|$|E
