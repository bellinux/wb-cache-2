5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate <b>disodium</b> calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Baconnaise {{contains}} no bacon, artificial flavors, or MSG, {{but the actual}} process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret. A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium <b>disodium</b> EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium <b>disodium,</b> and succimer.|$|E
25|$|Calcium <b>disodium</b> EDTA and sugars {{have been}} shown to inhibit benzene {{production}} in soft drinks.|$|E
25|$|Chelation therapy can be {{hazardous}} if administered incorrectly. In August 2005, an incorrect form of EDTA (edetate <b>disodium)</b> used for chelation therapy resulted in hypocalcemia, causing cardiac arrest that killed a five-year-old autistic boy.|$|E
25|$|All {{automotive}} antifreeze formulations, {{including the}} newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous {{because of the}} blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and corrosion inhibitors. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which {{are considered to be}} significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, <b>disodium</b> phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and dextrin (hydroxyethyl starch). <b>Disodium</b> fluorescein dyes are added to antifreeze to help trace the source of leaks, and as an identifier since some different formulations are incompatible.|$|E
25|$|Whole wheat {{macaroni}} products – {{similar to}} macaroni products except that only {{whole wheat flour}} or whole wheat durum flour, or both, {{may be used as}} the wheat ingredient. Further the addition of the various forms of egg whites, <b>disodium</b> phosphate and gum gluten are not permitted.|$|E
25|$|Wheat and soy {{macaroni}} products – {{begins as}} macaroni products {{with the addition}} of at least 12.5% of soy flour as a fraction of the total soy and wheat flour used. The addition the various forms of egg whites and <b>disodium</b> phosphate are not permitted. Gum gluten may be added with a limitation that the total protein content derived from the combination of the flours and added gluten not exceed 13%.|$|E
25|$|Nonfat milk {{macaroni}} products – {{the same}} as macaroni products except that nonfat dry milk or concentrated skim milk is used in preparing the dough. The finished macaroni product must contain between 12% and 25% milk solids-not-fat. Carageenan or carageenan salts may be added in specified amounts. The use of egg whites, <b>disodium</b> phosphate and gum gluten optionally allowed for macaroni products is not permitted for this category.|$|E
25|$|Vegetable {{macaroni}} products – {{begins as}} macaroni products except that tomato (of any red variety), artichoke, beet, carrot, parsley or spinach is {{added in a}} quantity such that the solids of the added component are at least 3% by weight of the finished macaroni product. The vegetable additions {{may be in the}} form of fresh, canned, dried or a puree or paste. The addition of either the various forms of egg whites or <b>disodium</b> phosphate allowed for macaroni products is not permitted in this category.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{was also}} used in various {{agricultural}} insecticides and poisons. For example, lead hydrogen arsenate was a common insecticide on fruit trees, but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in brain damage among those working the sprayers. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, monosodium methyl arsenate (MSMA) and <b>disodium</b> methyl arsenate (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – replaced lead arsenate in agriculture. These organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by 2013 in all agricultural activities except cotton farming.|$|E
25|$|Macaroni {{products}} – {{is defined}} as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including egg white, frozen egg white or dried egg white alone or in any combination; <b>disodium</b> phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.|$|E
25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of ribbons of sodium metal with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes. <b>Disodium</b> hydrogen phosphate is used to buffer the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding sodium amalgam reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and teratogenic, and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical fume hood. Mercury cannot be destroyed {{but it can be}} removed from aqueous solutions by using ion-exchange resins or by amalgamation with iron.|$|E
500|$|Cyanide {{complexes}} are technically organometallic {{but more}} important are carbonyl complexes and sandwich and half-sandwich compounds. [...] The premier iron(0) compound is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, {{which is used to}} produce carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl. Collman's reagent, <b>disodium</b> tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they can}} be {{beneficial}} in cases of serious lead poisoning, use of unapproved chelating agents is dangerous. [...] Use of <b>disodium</b> EDTA (edetate <b>disodium)</b> instead of calcium <b>disodium</b> EDTA has resulted in fatalities due to hypocalcemia. <b>Disodium</b> EDTA is not approved by the FDA for any use, and all FDA-approved chelation therapy products require a prescription.|$|E
2500|$|It is an aminopolycarboxylic {{acid and}} a colourless, {{water-soluble}} solid. Its conjugate base is ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It {{is widely used}} to dissolve limescale. Its usefulness arises because of {{its role as a}} hexadentate ("six-toothed") ligand and chelating agent, i.e., its ability to [...] "sequester" [...] metal ions such as Ca2+ and Fe3+. After being bound by EDTA into a metal complex, metal ions remain in solution but exhibit diminished reactivity. [...] EDTA is produced as several salts, notably <b>disodium</b> EDTA and calcium <b>disodium</b> EDTA.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescein is {{also known}} as a color {{additive}} (D Yellow no. 7). [...] The <b>disodium</b> salt form of fluorescein is known as uranine or D Yellow no. 8.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescein {{is among}} the first {{fluorescent}} dyes, developed in 1871. Its <b>disodium</b> salt under the trademark [...] "Uranine" [...] was developed several years later and still remains among the best tracer dyes.|$|E
2500|$|MSG is one {{of several}} forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is {{pervasive}} in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term [...] "spices and flavorings". The ribonucleotide food additives <b>disodium</b> inosinate and <b>disodium</b> guanylate are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term [...] "natural flavor" [...] is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration does not require disclosure of components and amounts of [...] "natural flavor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} the use of {{chelating}} agents to detoxify a patient's body of poisonous metal agents, such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, by converting them to a chemically inert form that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelation using calcium <b>disodium</b> EDTA has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but only for serious cases of lead poisoning. It is not approved for treating [...] "heavy metal toxicity".|$|E
2500|$|Borax, {{also known}} as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or <b>disodium</b> tetraborate, is an {{important}} boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered [...] borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. A number of closely related minerals or chemical compounds that differ in their crystal water content {{are referred to as}} borax, but the word is usually used to refer to the [...] Commercially sold borax is partially dehydrated.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this level}} wheat {{semolina}} and water are mixed by {{the ratio of}} 3 to 1. Water should be pure, with no off-flavor and suitable for drinking. Its temperature is about 35-45°C [...] to help speed up absorption. For egg noodles, eggs are added {{in the form of}} fresh eggs, frozen eggs, dry eggs, egg yolks or dry egg solids. If eggs are added to the mixture, the amount of water is modified. Adding egg improves the nutritional quality and richness of the pasta. <b>Disodium</b> phosphate is also added to reduce the cooking time.|$|E
2500|$|The chart shows {{solubility}} curves {{for some}} typical solid inorganic salts (temperature is in degrees Celsius i.e. kelvins minus 273). Many salts behave like barium nitrate and <b>disodium</b> hydrogen arsenate, and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., sodium chloride in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as calcium sulfate (gypsum) and cerium(III) sulfate, become less {{soluble in water}} as temperature increases. This {{is also the case}} of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) whose solubility at 70°C is about half of its value at 25°C. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide in water is also an exothermic process and obeys to the Le Chatelier's principle. A lowering of temperature will thus favour the dissolution heat elimination and increases the equilibrium constant of dissolution of Ca(OH)2, and so increase its solubility at low temperature. This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as [...] "retrograde" [...] or [...] "inverse" [...] solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with sodium sulfate, where the less soluble decahydrate crystal loses water of crystallization at 32°C to form a more soluble anhydrous phase.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> inosinate {{is used as}} {{a flavor}} enhancer, in synergy with monosodium {{glutamate}} (MSG) to provide the umami taste. It is often added to foods in conjunction with <b>disodium</b> guanylate; the combination is known as <b>disodium</b> 5'-ribonucleotides.|$|E
50|$|Guanosine monophosphate in {{the form}} of its salts, such as <b>disodium</b> {{guanylate}} (E627), dipotassium guanylate (E628) and calcium guanylate (E629), are food additives used as flavor enhancers to provide the umami taste. It is often used in synergy with <b>disodium</b> inosinate; the combination is known as <b>disodium</b> 5'-ribonucleotides. <b>Disodium</b> guanylate is often found in instant noodles, potato chips and snacks, savoury rice, tinned vegetables, cured meats, and packet soup.|$|E
50|$|The first {{clue that}} nitroxylic acid exists was when Edward Bedford Maxted {{electrolysed}} sodium nitrite dissolved in liquid ammonia. A bright yellow substance deposited on the cathode. He called this <b>disodium</b> nitrite. The <b>disodium</b> nitrite {{could also be}} made by mixing ammonia solutions of sodium and sodium nitrite in the complete absence of water. <b>Disodium</b> nitrite reacts with water to form sodium nitrite, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. Other {{ways to make the}} <b>disodium</b> nitrite include reacting sodium with ammonium nitrate or electrolysing sodium nitrate solution. Note that the <b>disodium</b> nitrite is very explosive, and experimenters often had their apparatus destroyed when making it. <b>Disodium</b> nitrite reacts with oxygen and carbon dioxide explosively. The substance is nowadays called sodium nitroxylate and has CAS number 13968-14-4.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disodium</b> guanylate, {{also known}} as sodium 5'-guanylate and <b>disodium</b> 5'-guanylate, is a natural sodium salt of the flavor {{enhancing}} nucleotide guanosine monophosphate (GMP). <b>Disodium</b> guanylate is a food additive with the E number E627. It is commonly {{used in conjunction with}} glutamic acid (monosodium glutamate, MSG).|$|E
