In comparison with other approaches aiming at 3 D models of knots and wood fibre orientation, e. g. Guindos and Guaita[2] and Hackspiel et al.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the appearance {{and number of}} knots in star-sawn triangular profiles of pine (Pinus silvestris L) and spruce (Picea abies Karst). The {{emphasis is placed on}} obtaining the volume yield of boards with a given knot appearance, together with the sizes of the fibre disturbances around the knots and how they affect the yield. The test material has been taken from three regions in Sweden and is made up of butt logs of pine and of normal and fast-growing spruce. The results show that {{a large proportion of the}} knots found in the triangular profiles from butt logs are unacceptable in further refinement of the timber and must be removed. Very few healthy knots can be found. To produce <b>knot</b> free <b>boards,</b> a volume reduction of on average 8 and 21 percent is obtained for pine and spruce respectively, calculated with respect to the original profile volume. If the fibre disturbance around the knots is also removed, a further volume loss of 5 percentage for pine and 6 percentage for spruce is obtained. The boards produced have a broad spectrum of lengths between 2 and 500 centimetres for pine and between 2 and 400 centimetres for spruce...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of sawn timber has huge natural variations {{that a human}} inspector easily compensates for in his brain when determining the types of defects and the grade of each board. However, for automatic wood inspection systems these variations are a major source for complication. For instance, normal wood grain and knots should be reliably discriminated in all circumstances, but simple thresholding based detection methods used in state-of-the-art inspection systems frequently fail even in this apparently straightforward task. Furthermore, the appearances of defects vary, so one <b>board's</b> sound <b>knot</b> is another <b>board's</b> dark one, {{making it difficult to}} use textbook methodologies for visual inspection.

This information would also be useful for future construction of virtual pruned logs in a sawing simulator. A sawn timber conversion percentage (proportion of sawn timber volume to log volume) was calculated for each log and mathematical relationships were defined for SED, Conversion Potential (CP) factor, PLI, heartwood content and percentage of dead and rotten branches.|$|R

The corresponding strength predicted by the simulation tool showed good agreement with the test results. The validated tool was then used to perform parameter studies in which the influence of various knot-related parameters on strength was investigated. The observed trends help to identify decisive <b>knot</b> parameters for <b>board</b> strength, which should receive particular attention in the grading process...|$|R

By using the first edgewise natural frequency, modulus of elasticity (MOE) was calculated. An ABAQUS 2 D Finite Element model was utilized to model the board and to extract the frequencies for the six first mode shapes in both axial and edgewise directions. The extracted frequencies from the model were compared with the frequencies from the tests. The analytical and experimental results, from the homogeneous boards, in edgewise direction has similar frequency variations. The defects in the timber boards decreased the natural frequencies. The bending modes with more curvature at the location of the artificial defect displayed more frequency deviation in that mode. The variation in response frequencies for uniform and defected boards was more noticeable in edgewise bending modes than in longitudinal modes...|$|R
5000|$|Knots {{materially}} affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken {{timber and}} lower its value for structural purposes where strength {{is an important}} consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces {{perpendicular to the grain}} and/or tension than when under load along the grain and/or compression. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a beam depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress. Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal shearing. <b>Knots</b> in a <b>board</b> or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects. Samuel J.

Sandberg Abstract Triangular profiles from star-sawing {{have been used}} to produce <b>knot</b> free gluelam <b>boards</b> with radial surfaces and a length of 2. 1 m. The volume yield has been evaluated in two different gluelam qualities. One was with finger joints and the other one without finger joints. The material used was 7. 78 m 3   triangular profiles of pine. The quality and dimension was sawfallen. The manufacture of the profiles has been carried out in five steps: Removal of knots and defects. Finger jointing of cut pieces. Planing of triangular profiles. Clueing of triangular profiles into blocks. Splitting the blocks into gluelam boards and finishing the surface. The measurements comprises all steps except splitting and final finishing. These steps have been simulated theoretically. The total volume yield was 53. 8 %. In the process three operations were found to be critical for the result. They are: removal of knots and defects, planing and splitting of blocks and finishing. These operations account for more than 93 % of the total loss during manufacturing. Removal of knots and defects resulted in 12, 8 % loss of volume. 13 % of the manufactured blocks were without knots, defects and finger joints.
