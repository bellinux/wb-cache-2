25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high gas prices are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the <b>heating</b> <b>season</b> heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.|$|E

2500|$|Ground-source heat pumps, {{also called}} {{geothermal}} heat pumps, typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps. [...] This {{is because they}} draw heat from the ground or groundwater which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet (9 m). This means that the temperature differential is lower, leading to higher efficiency. [...] Well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have COPs of 4.0 {{at the beginning of}} the <b>heating</b> <b>season,</b> with lower seasonal COPs of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground. The tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install, due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid (water with a little antifreeze).|$|E

50|$|In {{cold and}} mixed climates, windows should be designed, sized and {{positioned}} {{in order to}} provide solar heat gains during the <b>heating</b> <b>season.</b> To that end, glazing should have a relatively high Solar Heat Gains coefficient; it should not block solar heat gains, as much as possible, especially in the sunny side of the house. For triple glazing, consider a whole-window SHGC in the range 0.33 - 0.47; for double glazing consider a SHGC in the range 0.42 - 0.55 (the higher the better).|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{concerns a}} case study involving moisture performance of a contemporary wood frame house over a series of <b>heating</b> <b>seasons</b> in Madison, Wisconsin. Over most of the <b>heating</b> <b>seasons,</b> the building was humidified to levels as calculated by methodology outlined in section 4. 3. 2 of Proposed ASHRAE Standard 160, Design Criteria for Moisture Control in Buildings. Over the first two <b>heating</b> <b>seasons</b> following construction, indoor humidity levels moderately lower than design conditions were attained, even though the house was neither occupied nor humidified. The moisture source was evidently wet soil around the building foundation, a condition probably associated with roof runoff deposited near the foundation during construction. Over the third, fourth and fifth <b>heating</b> <b>seasons</b> the house was brought to design indoor humidity values with less than anticipated mois ture release by humidifiers. Throughout the study, the indoor humidity levels resulted in some window condensation in cold weather, but the condensation was restricted to glass panes. Attic spaces remained dry. Painted wood-based sidings showed no staining, buckling, warping or finish failure. Stucco cladding showed cracking that, although minor, {{would be consistent with}} seasonal moisture accumulation in the sheathing. Substantial seasonal moisture accumulation was measured in the sheathing of exterior walls that did not incorporate an interior vapor retarder. Vapor retarding interior wall paint mitigated moisture accu mulation, but nonetheless permitted seasonal peak sheathing moisture contents to exceed 16 %. Seasonal moisture accumulation was greater in walls clad with plywood panel siding or stucco than it was in walls clad with strandboard lap siding or brick veneer. With lap siding, an air gap between siding and sheathing, even though not intentionally ventilated, reduced seasonal moisture accumulation and aided in springtime dissipation of moisture...|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{a system}} which {{delivers}} an HSPF of 7.7 will transfer 2.25 times as much heat as electricity consumed over a season.

50|$|Some earthship {{structures}} {{have suffered}} from heat loss into the ground during the <b>heating</b> <b>season.</b> This {{may be due to}} climatic differences between New Mexico where earthships were first built and cloudier, cooler, and wetter climates.

Malcolm Wells, an architect and authority on earth-sheltered design, recommends an imperial R-value 10 insulation between deep soils and heated spaces. Wells's insulation recommendations increase as the depth of the soil decreases (a negative correlation).|$|E
