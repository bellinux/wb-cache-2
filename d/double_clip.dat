KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using <b>Double</b> <b>Clip</b> Angle Connections as the default standard for simple shear connections. A <b>double</b> <b>clip</b> angle connection is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of <b>Double</b> <b>Clip</b> Angle Connections is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single shear plate or shear tab connections when applied to open structure design. Shear tab connections consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear tab connections can be a more involved process than the design of <b>double</b> <b>clip</b> angles. Sometimes the shear plate or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended shear plate connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with <b>Double</b> <b>Clip</b> Angle Connections such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple bolt columns. However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. <b>Double</b> <b>clip</b> angles are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, shear plate or shear tab connections have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} the block shear failure behavior of coped beams with <b>double</b> welded <b>clip</b> angle connection was conducted. Parametric study was conducted based on the validated finite element model. The parameters included the web block aspect ratio and the connection rotational stiffness. Based on the mechanical model of double angle connection, the pitch and the beam element length-to-angle thickness (L/t) ratio of the outstanding leg were selected as two importance parameters to consider {{the effect of the}} connection rotational stiffness. The results of parametric study show that the connection rotational stiffness has a great influence {{on the block}} shear capacity of coped beams with <b>double</b> welded <b>clip</b> angle connection. This is contributed to the fact that for the connections with a smaller connection rotational stiffness, the shear stresses of the shear area were much less than those of the connections with a larger connection rotational stiffness...|$|R

40|$|In the study, the {{experiments}} are performed to determine thickness effect on critical crack tip opening displacement (δ_IC) of the single-edge tension (SE(T)) specimen with side-groove. The applicability and thickness sensitivity of several fracture toughness estimation procedures are also {{investigated by the}} experimental data. Referring to the results by the <b>double</b> <b>clip</b> gauge method, {{it is found that}} the critical crack initiation toughness decreases significantly as specimen thickness increases until the thickness-to-width ratio equal to 4, beyond which thickness effect becomes relatively weak. Accordingly, a dimension size is recommended for the fracture toughness testing to take the out-of-plane constraint into account for SE(T) specimen. The further analyses based on the plastic zone size confirm the result as well...|$|E
40|$|Block shear {{is one of}} {{the major}} failure modes for coped steel I-beams. While focus of {{previous}} studies on the block shear capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the connections with <b>double</b> <b>clip</b> angles, single-sided connections, which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block tear-out manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the block shear capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the block shear capacity. These effects are further discussed via a finite element analysis and a preliminary parametric study. Finally, the test results are compared with four major design standards. It is found that the Canadian Standards CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, which gives a test-to-predicted ratio ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 17, provided relatively good predictions for the specimens with single bolt line layout, while the predictions by other codes are too conservative. For those specimens with double bolt line layout, the capacities are underestimated by all the considered standards. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E

40|$|The {{ends of a}} coped beam are {{commonly}} connected to the web of a girder by <b>double</b> <b>clip</b> angles. The clip angles may either be bolted or welded to the web of the beam. One of the potential modes {{for the failure of}} the clip angle connection is the block shear of the beam web material. To investigate the strength and the behavior of the block shear of coped beams with welded end connections, ten full-scale coped beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the aspect ratio of the clip angles, the web shear and tension area around the clip angles, the web thickness, beam section depth, cope length, and connection position. The test results indicated that the specimens failed, developing either tension fractures of the web {{near the bottom of the}} clip angles or local web buckling near the end of the cope. Although the final failure mode of the six specimens was local web buckling, it was observed during the tests that these specimens exhibited a significant deformation of the block shear type prior to reaching their final failure mode. No shear fracture was observed in all of the tests. A comparison between the ultimate loads in the test and the predictions using the current design equations indicates that the current design standards such as the AISC-LRFD, CSA-S 16 - 01, Eurocode 3, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, AIJ and GB 50017, are inconsistent in predicting the block shear strength of coped beams with welded end connections. The analytical study of the strength of the test specimens using the finite element method, a parametric study, and a proposed design model for designing block shears for coped beams with welded clip angles are included in a companion paper.

The {{sections of the}} first part of the report deal with a dual range, <b>double</b> ended telemetry <b>clipping</b> circuit. They describe the requirements, design, computer analysis, breadboard testing, and performance evaluation of the device. A unique design configuration allows for rapid clipping range selection without component alterations. In the second task, the concept of holography, or three-dimensional laser photography, is investigated and proposed as a method of determining the location of missiles in flight. The holographic image of a missile can be matched with a photograph of the missile in flight taken from a specified reference point. The feasibility of deriving accurate measurements from this approach is investigated in that part of the project report...|$|R

A series of speech (letters and syllables) and guitar and piano music (single and <b>double</b> notes) video <b>clips</b> were presented randomly {{at a range}} of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) using the method of constant stimuli. Participants made unspeeded temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding which stream (auditory or visual) {{appeared to have been}} presented first. The accuracy of participants' TOJ performance (measured in terms of the just noticeable difference; JND) was significantly better for the speech than for either the guitar or piano music video clips, suggesting that people are more sensitive to asynchrony for speech than for music stimuli. The visual stream had to lead the auditory stream for the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) to be achieved in the piano music clips while auditory leads were typically required for the guitar music clips. The PSS values obtained for the speech stimuli varied substantially {{as a function of the}} particular speech sound presented. These results provide the first empirical evidence regarding people's sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony for musical stimuli. Our results also demonstrate that people's sensitivity to asynchrony in speech stimuli is better than has been suggested on the basis of previous research using continuous speech streams as stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Microtubules are an {{essential}} component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Proper functioning of the microtubular network depends highly on its dynamic properties, with frequent transitions from phases of prolonged growth to rapid shrinkage (catastrophe) and vice versa (rescue). Several proteins have been shown to bind to microtubules, some of them, the so-called plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs), binding specifically to the growing ends of microtubules. This thesis describes the functional analysis of two +TIPs, the Cytoplasmic Linker Proteins CLIP- 115 and CLIP- 170. These proteins are structurally highly similar resulting in a high level of redundancy. Although single CLIP- 115 or CLIP- 170 knockout mice both have characteristic features, no large abnormalities were found in fibroblasts derived from them. To learn more about the CLIPs and their redundant functions, <b>CLIP</b> <b>double</b> knockout (DKO) mice were generated. The dynamic properties of the microtubules in ce! lls derived from these mice were profoundly altered with a five-fold decrease in rescue-frequency. In addition, the microtubule network was changed notably, with large microtubule-free areas in which proteins aggregates were found. These aggregates contained the microtubule motor-protein cytoplasmic dynein and several components of the dynactin complex. Furthermore DKO fibroblasts spread abnormally, resulting in a two-fold increase of the surface area in attached cells compared to wild type cells. The mice deficient for both CLIP- 115 and CLIP- 170 have an abnormal posture and show hind limb clasping. Although they perform poorly on certain behavioral and strength-related tasks, they show a surprising age-related improvement of motor coordination. At older ages, certain tasks start to deteriorate again. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analysis a progressive form of hydrocephalus is detected. In younger mice, an accumulation of cerebellar neurons is see! n {{in other parts of the}} brain, indicating a defect in neuronal migrati on. Taken together, the results described in this thesis confirm that CLIP- 115 and CLIP- 170 act as rescue factors, but that they also have important functions in regulating cell spreading and neuronal migration...|$|R
