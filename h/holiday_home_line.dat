40|$|Large scale {{ownership}} {{and use of}} <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> is a recent phenomenon in most developed countries. Increased leisure time, affluence and mobility since World War II have enabled many sections of society to own a <b>holiday</b> <b>home.</b> <b>Holiday</b> <b>homes</b> permit a regular change of environment and participation {{in a wide range}} of recreational activities. Rural economies often benefit from <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> occurrence through increased trade for local business, opportunities for farmers to sell surplus land and produce, and increased taxation revenue for local authorities. Due to the large amounts of land they require, <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> have become a distinctive element in the settlement pattern in coastal and lacustrine environments of Tasmania. High density ribbon settlement in some areas has led to both physical and visual erosion of these landscapes. The distribution of <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> in Tasmania in 1977 and the changes in the distribution since 1960 are examined, The current location of <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> and changes in the distribution pattern of <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> are shown to be dependent upon the location of attractive sites, access from major population centres and the socio-economic characteristics of the population. These factors combine to produce some distinctive spatial regularities both in the distribution of <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> and in the relationship between the permanent homesite. The curnmt state of planning legislation in Tasmania in relation to <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{ownership}} {{and use of}} <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> for recreational purposes is a phenomenon which {{has a long history}} in New Zealand. This thesis examines the impact that the presence of <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> have upon a region and its inhabitants. At present there are approximately 1300 <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> on Banks Peninsula catering largely for the recreational needs of Christchurch, and Canterbury families. An assessment of the impact is made by firstly identifying the important characteristics of the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> distribution, the nature of the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> itself and the socio-economic characteristics of the owners. Secondly, the factors that will influence the final impact are examined. This involves the identification of the patterns of use made of the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> and the activities undertaken in the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> area. Thirdly, the actual impact is studied by assessing the opinions of the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> owners and establishing their spending patterns; and their propensity to employ local residents. Finally, the local inhabitants' attitudes and opinions are examined concerning the impact of the <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> upon their household and their area. The local business owners' opinions are also given here. The data for this thesis was collected through a 20 % survey sample of all the owners on Banks Peninsula. In addition, over one hundred local inhabitants were interviewed, and all the businessmen and tradesmen were contacted and interviewed by questionnaire. The impact of the <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> is assessed with the thought in mind that the area has a declining rural economy, and that it also plays a major role as a recreational area for Canterbury people. In overall terms, the <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> on Banks Peninsula appear to be of a beneficial nature to the area and its inhabitants, and it is perceived to be as such by the locals and the <b>holiday</b> <b>home</b> owners alike...|$|R
