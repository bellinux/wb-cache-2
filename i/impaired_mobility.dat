25|$|Stiff person {{syndrome}} (SPS), {{also known}} as stiff man syndrome (SMS), is a rare neurologic disorder of unclear cause characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness. The stiffness primarily affects the truncal muscles and is superimposed by spasms, resulting in postural deformities. Chronic pain, <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility,</b> and lumbar hyperlordosis are common symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Although often {{prevented}} and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be {{very difficult}} to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders, individuals with <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility</b> such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved). Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person. The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century. In addition to turning and re-positioning the person in the bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is very important.|$|E
25|$|Age. Age {{can also}} be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care {{expenses}} difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility</b> or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet. This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via Medicare.|$|E

25|$|However, {{given the}} very real {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility</b> later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, avascular necrosis, trochanteric bursitis, and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the gluteus maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
25|$|Patient {{transfer}} devices generally allow {{patients with}} <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility</b> {{to be moved}} by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|E

This, however, prevents them from leaving the Victoria line, except by road. The trains seat 252 and have standing space for an estimated 1,196 passengers, giving a 19% increase in capacity over the 1967 Stock. They also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting of passengers in order to reduce dwell times in stations. The trains have been built with Bombardier's FICAS technology, giving a thinner bodyshell and hence (along with the larger size) more internal space for passengers. They are the first London Underground trains to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations were introduced, so they have more facilities for people with <b>impaired</b> <b>mobility,</b> including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs, and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access.|$|E

METHOD: a prospective cohort {{study was conducted with}} 24 patients hospitalized due to a CVA.

RESULTS: the most frequent risk factors for respiratory aspiration were: dysphagia (54. 2 %) and <b>impaired</b> physical <b>mobility</b> (41. 7 %). The prevalence of the nursing diagnosis Risk for Aspiration was 58. 3 % and the prevalence of respiratory aspiration over the span of 48 hours (monitoring period) was 37. 5 %.
