5|$|Cantacuzino {{ended his}} period of {{reflection}} in January 1915, when he openly supported Alexandru Marghiloman in creating a pro-German subgroup within the Conservative Party. Jeopardizing their standing in the party, both men cited irregularities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> caucus.|$|E
5|$|Union Bank of Switzerland {{entered the}} 1990s {{as the largest}} and most {{conservative}} of the three large Swiss Banks. The bank's investments had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> asset management and life insurance businesses; further, 60% of the bank's profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} chemist {{before becoming}} a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his Conservative government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition {{and became the first}} woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate about}} his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> pantheon has {{continued}} since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; {{he was seen}} by many, including some {{members of his own}} party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.|$|E
5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first {{years on the}} Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E
5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1851 presidential election, <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> {{candidate}} was Manuel Montt. He triumphed, but many conservatives were unhappy {{with him and}} accused him of anticlericalism. <b>In</b> 1851, <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party was officially formed by the anti-Montt pelucones. Although Montt won reelection <b>in</b> 1856, <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party defeated his National Party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary elections of 1858.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{had last}} won a general {{election}} <b>in</b> 1992. <b>The</b> general election of 2010 resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> led by Cameron, winning {{the largest number of}} seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's first hung parliament since February 1974.|$|R
5|$|Following his release, Dostoyevsky read {{a myriad}} of {{literature}} and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies and increasingly sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Gambler and The Brothers Karamazov. With {{the help of his}} brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazinesVremya and Epochin which some of his stories appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> The Russian Messenger until the introduction of A Writer's Diary, which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, remain unfinished.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In May 1874, {{soon after}} taking over Minister of Education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu, his friend Maiorescu granted Creangă the {{position}} of schoolteacher in the Iași area of Păcurari. During the same period, Ion Creangă met and became best friends with Mihai Eminescu, posthumously celebrated as Romania's national poet. This {{is said to have}} taken place in summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu's Education Ministry, overseeing schools in Iași County: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă's talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.|$|E

25|$|Klein's {{efforts were}} seen as {{successful}} <b>in</b> reinvigorating <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> from certain defeat just under a year earlier. Ending up, they retained a solid majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature for its seventh consecutive term <b>in</b> government. <b>The</b> <b>Conservatives</b> increased {{its share of the}} popular vote marginally, and lost eight seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature.|$|R
5|$|A {{former member}} of the Conservative Party and the libertarian {{organisation}} Libertas, Gjems-Onstad joined Anders Lange's Party when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the 1973 parliamentary election, and became the party's parliamentary leader following Anders Lange's death in 1974. Many of his views and proposals caused controversy, and he got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by Carl I. Hagen. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an independent. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in Africa, and for defending the governments of countries such as Rhodesia and South Africa. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the Stop Immigration party in 1989 and for the Fatherland Party in 1991, and he was later involved in the militant organisation Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring ("Peoples movement against immigration") and later Stop Islamisation of Norway. He was briefly active locally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party and the Pensioners' Party in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear was a factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E

50|$|The UK {{does not}} have the {{consensus}} among the elite of the country on the benefits of EU membership, as opposed to other EU member states.
