500|$|Hackett has {{considered}} the album {{to be his}} favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that was good news for us at that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time." [...] Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying {{there are a lot of}} high points but also some lows.|$|E
500|$|Hackworth said [...] "it was {{neck and}} neck, but I had {{absolute}} belief {{we could do}} it". [...] Four-time Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent said of the race [...] "it truly was amazing". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams was generous in defeat: [...] "Credit to Oxford. They did an awesome job and took their chance. It was a fantastic race", while Oxford's coach Sean Bowden said [...] "I believed that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through Barnes Bridge well we could still do it. [...] They were rowing so well and I knew how much they wanted it." [...] Simon Barnes of The Times noted that [...] "Cambridge reeled in an early Oxford lead and went ahead themselves ... {{that should have been}} the end of it... But this Oxford crew just kept pestering away ... and, with the finish in sight, Cambridge ... yielded." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008. Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News, [...] "I {{thought it would}} be funny to see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> [...] to read very, very dense historical documents centering around the second World War, [...] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self-analysis, which I thought was funny." [...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Looking at him.] There {{must be some}} {{incident}} in her career which she wouldn't like raked up. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> hold of that....|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care how}} cold they are, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> enough," [...] grumbled Chet. An almost empty stomach did not tend {{to put him}} in good humor.|$|R
6000|$|... "She does, sir; and she's got {{something}} locked up somewhere {{in that house}} as'd elucidate the whole of this aggravating mystery, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> at it. Major,--" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I do {{not respect}} Christian beliefs. [...] I {{think they are}} ridiculous. [...] <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of them we could more easily {{get down to the}} serious problem of {{trying to find out what}} the world is all about.": ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{campaign}} video in January 2008, McCain said [...] "I believe that America {{did the right}} thing by not joining the Kyoto treaty, but I believe that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> China and India into it, then the United States should seriously consider on our terms joining with every other nation in the world to try and reduce greenhouse gases. It's got to be a global effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barton favors {{repealing}} the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare). Explaining why the American Health Care Act (the House Republicans' bill to repeal and replace for the Affordable Care Act) failed in March 2017, Barton said, [...] "Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re {{in the real}} game. We knew the president, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a repeal bill to his desk, would almost certainly veto it. This time we knew if {{it got to the}} president’s desk it would be signed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It beats me,” he said, {{shaking his}} head. “But I don’t {{like to give}} up, and that tomato-juice would be of service <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> at it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There's {{only one}} cure for starvation--work! <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> some work back here. That's {{the only thing}} that allows you to be human and foolish, as you've got to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's like us all,' said Byrne whimsically. 'We're all penned {{out on a}} wet evening, but <b>we</b> think, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{where someone}} else is, it would be deliciously cosy.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In October of 2004, at {{the annual}} Parliamentary Press Gallery dinner in Ottawa, Martin spoke about meeting with Bush and {{discussing}} {{the possibility of a}} manned mission to Mars. [...] "I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a Canadian on board? If a Canadian could be sent tens of millions of miles into the dark void of space. And as we all as a nation watch on television and together say aloud, `Bon voyage, Carolyn Parrish!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2012, Chibnall {{contacted}} Ólafur {{to ask him}} {{to compose}} the music for Broadchurch. [...] "The music is a narrative all of its own," [...] Chibnall later said. [...] "I'd heard Ólafur's music and it just broke my heart. I instinctively felt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him, that would be amazing." [...] Ólafur agreed to join the production, and his hiring was publicly announced in December 2012. Ólafur called working on Broadchurch series one [...] "an absolute pleasure. The creators and directors gave me complete artistic freedom and encouraged me to be as bold as possible. Which is what every artist wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gauss {{wrote of}} the heliotrope's {{potential}} as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to Heinrich Olbers, by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact extraterrestrial life: [...] "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one {{would be able to}} send good heliotrope-light to the moon.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> in touch with our neighbors on the moon." [...] Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with Franz von Gruithuisen, Gauss stated words to the effect that [...] "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common." [...] Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be so near!" [...] {{said the}} Ward Leader. [...] "Now {{that we have}} found those guns. To be so near--. <b>If</b> once <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> them out upon the roof spaces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fairly {{complete}} record, Watson! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> {{at the man}} at {{the other}} end!" [...] He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table. Finally he sprang to his feet.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Dempsey, {{the great}} Heavyweight Champion, once said: [...] "Jim Jeffries {{was a tough}} gun. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gotten</b> in the ring together, each at our best... I {{probably}} would have had my chin knocked off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They'd {{think it}} was an {{insurance}} paper. No, that won't do. But Mutual comes pretty near the idea. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> something like that, it would pique curiosity; and then <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> paragraphs afloat explaining that the contributors were to be paid according to the sales, it would be a first-rate ad." ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. Now, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{everybody}} in the right job, we wouldn't have any more wars, I guess.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a silly idea!" [...] she exclaimed, with a contemptuous toss of {{her long}} brown curls. [...] "Just as <b>if</b> <b>WE</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up a newspaper!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll {{let it go}} easy if you {{put your}} hand to it. He's safe enough now. There. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> him back from the fire a little, or his face'll be burnt off of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> {{there it}} would be a relief. I should draw a long breath. There at least I know where I am and what people are. But here one lives on hollow ground!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, Sir Henry, if brother Roger did {{not lose}} {{patience}} with him, it would be hard, indeed, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> on with him; and in truth, this desire to improve himself speaks well for the lad's disposition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{money will}} do a great many things. We would send all round the world <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{evidence}} against that other man,--Lady Eustace's husband, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're sure it's {{far enough}} off?' he asked ironically, adding at once: 'Yes, you might go there, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a boat. They {{seem to be}} all out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{mean that}} for a moment. I only thought <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> a {{chaplain}} from somewhere,--I'm willing to ride anywhere,--and give poor Hummil a better chance. That's all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{ought to}} get home," [...] {{observed}} the boy. [...] "Our folks will worry about us, and Earth's {{the best place to}} live, after all. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> hold of my Magic Umbrella, we'd be all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jowett {{is the one}} to {{get hold}} of," [...] mused Clodd. [...] "Jowett, all the others follow like a flock of geese {{waddling}} after the old gander. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> hold of Jowett, the rest would be easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Malcolm agreed, [...] "there {{would be}} no {{difficulty}} in swimming if unencumbered with arms and armour, but there {{would be no}} advantage in getting across without these; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> hold of a boat or two, we would soon wake yonder Spaniards up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "No, I was {{thinking}} what fun {{it would be}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up a sort of Christmas game, and do it just among relations and intimate friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! I'll go to-morrow," [...] said John. [...] "And, after this, I {{shall be}} steady at it. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Lillie to go," [...] said he, doubtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} he could do anything. He would be afraid to use a high hand. He is Bohemian. The head of the police might do something, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Then pray, Budden, {{write to}} your cousin at once,’ replied Mrs. Budden. ‘Who knows, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> him down here, {{but he might}} take a fancy to our Alexander, and leave him his property?—Alick, my dear, take your legs off the rail of the chair!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm talking seriously," [...] said Robina: [...] "what's {{the good}} of a drawing- room? One only wants it to show the sort of people into that one wishes hadn't come. They'd sit about, looking miserable, just as well {{anywhere}} else. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> rid of the stairs--" ...|$|R
60|$|The sight filled {{us with an}} unreasoning joy. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it, {{there was}} food in plenty. But the {{question}} was how to do so. The beasts were fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be depended on when our lives hung on the results.|$|R
