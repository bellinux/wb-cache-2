25|$|The Republican {{government}} {{which came to}} power in Spain in 1931 was strongly anti-clerical, secularising education, prohibiting religious education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>and</b> expelling the Jesuits from the country.

25|$|In 1918, it {{was decided}} that all Academicians and Associates on {{reaching}} the age of 75 would become members of a Senior Order of Academicians, thereby creating a vacancy in the other categories of membership. A senior member is effectively retired from the day-to-day government of the Academy but retains all other membership privileges. All RAs are entitled to exhibit up to six works in the annual Summer Exhibition. They also have the opportunity to exhibit their work in small exhibitions held in the Friends' Room and are occasionally invited to hold major exhibitions in the Sackler Galleries.

25|$|Upon {{assuming}} power, Allende {{began to}} carry out his platform of implementing a socialist programme called La vía chilena al socialismo ("the Chilean Path to Socialism"). This included nationalization of large-scale industries (notably copper mining and banking), and government administration of the health care system, educational system (with the help of a United States educator, Jane A. Hobson-Gonzalez from Kokomo, Indiana), a programme of free milk for children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva, who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover. Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public work projects.|$|E
500|$|Gilkeson resumed the {{practice}} of law and pursued a political career, but he continued his involvement with, and advocacy for, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, especially through his influence as a prominent lawyer and state legislator. Gilkeson used his position as a state legislator to condemn and hold accountable the officials responsible for the mismanagement of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, and often interceded on the schools' behalf following Hill's retirement due to political reasons. Gilkeson was displeased with the state's political interference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>and</b> the [...] "multiplication" [...] of positions within the institution that were filled with personnel who had political or business ties but lacked prior knowledge or experience with deaf and blind education.|$|E

500|$|As England became {{increasingly}} mercantilist and secularist, the humanist educational {{values of the}} Renaissance, which had enshrined scholasticism, came to be regarded by many as irrelevant. Following in the intellectual tradition of Francis Bacon, who had challenged the cultural authority of the classics, reformers such as Locke, and later Philip Doddridge, argued against Cambridge and Oxford's decree that [...] "all Bachelaur and Undergraduats in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strifes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools,</b> <b>and</b> only follow Aristotle and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude from the Schools all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the antient and true Philosophy [...]" [...] Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying Greek and Latin texts, {{an increasing number of}} families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the emerging sciences, mathematics, and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{authorities}} {{sought to}} remove all trace of the Polish history of the area now under their control. The name [...] "Poland" [...] was banned. Polish monuments were torn down. All institutions of the dismantled Polish state, including the Lwów University, were closed, then reopened, mostly with new Russian directors. Soviet Communist ideology became paramount in all teaching. Polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the Soviet authorities, and the Polish language was replaced with Russian or Ukrainian. Polish-language books were burned even in the primary schools. Polish teachers were not allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>and</b> many were arrested. Classes were held in Belorussian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian, with a new pro-Soviet curriculum. As Polish-Canadian historian Piotr Wróbel noted, citing British historians M. R. D. Foot and I. C. B. Dear, majority of scholars believe that [...] "In the Soviet occupation zone, conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the Germans." [...] In September 1939, many Polish Jews had fled east; after some months of living under Soviet rule, some of them wanted {{to return to the}} German zone of occupied Poland.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Ritchie {{concluded}} that the Parish Schools Act created a general system of education {{for the benefit of}} all inhabitants of the Province, without reference to class or creed. [...] The schools were public schools, not under the control of any denomination.

[...] Rather, there was a general recognition of Christian precepts as part of the education of the students, without favouring any denomination in particular.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{sought in}} the 1980s and 1990s to {{eventually}} abolish all public schools; {{but by the}} 2008 presidential election campaign, he had adopted a more moderate stance. Paul insists that [...] "the federal government has absolutely no role in education" [...] under the Constitution, [...] "regardless of what the Supreme Court has claimed." [...] He argues {{that the best way}} to improve the quality of education while fighting rising costs, growing numbers of dropouts, and higher levels of violence and drug use among students is to reduce the reach of centralized government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> return control over school curricula, funding, and administration back to parents and local communities.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1939, Lomax hosted two {{series on}} CBS's nationally {{broadcast}} American [...] School of the Air, called American Folk Song and Wellsprings of Music, both music appreciation courses that aired daily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> {{were supposed to}} highlight links between American folk and classical orchestral music. As host, Lomax sang and presented other performers, including Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Josh White, and the Golden Gate Quartet. The individual programs reached ten million students in 200,000 U.S. classrooms and were also broadcast in Canada, Hawaii, and Alaska, but both Lomax and his father felt {{that the concept of}} the shows, which portrayed folk music as mere raw material for orchestral music, was deeply flawed and failed to do justice to vernacular culture.|$|E

2500|$|King James IV's major {{contribution}} to the universities was to combat militant Presbyterianism by insisting that the catechism God and the King must be read <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> universities. He also decreed, in 1617, that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of Charles I (r. 1625–49), to form the [...] "King Charles University of Aberdeen". Under the Commonwealth (1652–60), the universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. They were still largely seen as training schools for clergy, and came {{under the control of}} the hard line Protesters, who were generally favoured by the regime because of their greater antipathy to royalism, with leading protester Patrick Gillespie being made Principal at Glasgow in 1652. After the Restoration there was a purge of Presbyterians from the universities, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved. There was considerable mistrust between the two colleges in Aberdeen, which was sufficient to produce an armed riot over the poaching of students in 1659. The two institutions were formally demerged by the Rescissory Act 1661.|$|E
2500|$|The {{education}} {{budget was}} doubled from 3% to 6%, while {{an expansion of}} secondary education took place. The number of university students went up from 100,000 to 650,000, 30,000 more places were created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>and</b> an additional 1,000 million marks was allocated for new school buildings. In addition, the provision of scholarships was expanded, with the 1970 programme providing for, {{in the words of}} one observer, “5,000 new scholarships for graduates, and double that number were being awarded three years later.” Grants were introduced for pupils from lower income groups to stay on at school, together with grants for those going into any kind of higher or further education. Increases were also made in educational allowances, as well as spending on science. In 1972, the government allocated 2.1 million DM in grants to promote marriage and family education. Under the Approbationsordnung (medical education profession act) of 1970, the subject of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy at German universities became a compulsory subject for medical students, and that same year education of clinical and biomedical engineers was introduced. The Brandt Administration also introduced enabling legislation for the introduction of comprehensives, but left it to the Lander [...] "to introduce them at their discretion." [...] While the more left-wing Lander [...] "rapidly began to do so," [...] other Lander found [...] "all sorts of pretexts for delaying the scheme." [...] By the mid-Eighties, Berlin had 25 comprehensives while Bavaria only had 1, and in most Lander comprehensives were still viewed as [...] "merely experimental." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Otago {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1848 and had an overwhelmingly Presbyterian character. There were very few Catholics there. However, in March 1861 gold was discovered at the Lindis Pass and Gabriel Read made public his successful discovery of gold at Tuapeka in June. The situation dramatically changed. Every steamer reaching Port Chalmers or Bluff was packed with would-be miners, {{many of whom were}} Catholics. Accordingly, Bishop Viard (Bishop of the Catholic diocese of Wellington in which Dunedin was located at that time) appointed Father Delphin Moreau SM, who had visited Otago in April 1859, to be its first resident priest. Mass was said in the courthouse until St Joseph's Church was completed in July 1862. In 1864 the Catholic population of Otago was estimated at over 15,000; chapels (many of them rough and ready) sprang up in the diggings and main towns, and schools came into existence. A school was opened in 1863 and was called St Joseph's School (it still exists as a primary school). [...] "When the old wooden Provincial Government buildings were replaced by new brick ones, the former were sold. Father Moreau secured some of them for his school. One large room was put {{on the side of the}} Rattrey Street gully, below the church. It was divided into two parts - one for the boys and one for the girls. Other parts of the buildings were used as a coach house and stables. In 1864, the boys at the school were taught by Mr Shepherd and the girls were taught by Miss Campion. In 1870 Mr Shepherd still taught the boys and the girls were taught by Miss Conway. [...] "Father Moreau took a great interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> was constantly among the children in the playground, always wearing his cassock which was green with age; he knew every child and was loved by them all. His hope was to obtain brothers and nuns to staff his schools." ...|$|E
50|$|Due to SAVE’s efforts, {{there was}} a {{decrease}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of violent incidents, weapons found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> excursion rate of students. This sparked an increase of chapters being started at other local high schools.|$|R
