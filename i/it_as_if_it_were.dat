5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E
25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|Because all saxophones use {{the same}} key {{arrangement}} and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, {{it is not difficult}} for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> treble clef and adding three sharps to the key signature. This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} {{election of}} a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a corrupt practice is void, and anyone found personally guilty of a corrupt practice is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) {{for a period of}} five years. In addition, if the offender is a solicitor, barrister, advocate or member of another regulated profession (such as a medical doctor) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> professional misconduct, and thus could result in suspension or being struck off their professional register. If an election court finds that someone with a licence for the sale of alcohol allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.|$|E
25|$|Heima, {{tied up with}} rope, reveals Shihei's plot {{to seize}} power, {{describing}} each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, {{at least not in}} body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he will engage in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} {{for this}} episode, director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley refer to an additional motivation for Adam's actions. Apparently, in earlier drafts of the script, Adam's father {{suffered from a}} disease that was incurable in his time (2012) and he hoped to learn about a cure which had been discovered between that year and 200,000. In the shooting script, the condition is arthritis. No trace of this motivation remains in the finished programme, although Grant discusses <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> still present. Langley and Grant also reveal that the [...] "frozen vomit" [...] that Adam spits out in one scene {{was in fact a}} [...] "kiwi and orange ice cube".|$|E

500|$|The film {{introduces}} {{a vehicle that}} has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed [...] "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The {{final version of the}} Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
500|$|Having {{started his}} career as a remixer, Pettibone built the basic music of the Erotica songs in the style of his remixes for which Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics. According to Pettibone in an article [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he began with a tape of three tracks for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on demos in his apartment in October 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.|$|E
500|$|Andy's bandmates {{during the}} rock show scene were played by Mark Rivers (drums), Andrew Burlinson (guitar) and Alan Yang (bass). All four actors {{performed}} their own instruments live during the filming. Originally, {{they planned to}} pre-record the songs and pantomime them for the episode, but after practicing a few times around the extras, they decided to shoot it live. The band performed each song twice, and Schur said he tried to shoot and direct <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> a music video. Yang is a writer with Parks and Recreation, and wrote the previous first season episode, [...] "Boys' Club". Rivers is a composer {{who has worked on}} the sketch comedy show Human Giant, which starred Parks star Aziz Ansari. Rivers wrote the songs performed in [...] "Rock Show", which Pratt said took him only [...] "about fifteen minutes". [...] Hiscock wrote the lyrics for [...] "The Pit" [...] in the initial outline for the episode and they were handed to Rivers who then fleshed them out. [...] The songs were designed to resemble the music of the American rock band Hootie & the Blowfish. The only song not written by Rivers was [...] "Ann", a romantic ballad Andy played for Ann, which was written by Pratt himself. [...] "Ann" [...] first appeared in [...] "Boys' Club".|$|E

500|$|Born Villain was {{released}} worldwide from April 30, {{with a cover}} of Carly Simon's [...] "You're So Vain" [...] included on all editions as a bonus track. This cover was recorded after the album had been completed, and features Johnny Depp performing guitar. The pair were introduced when Manson appeared as an extra on 21 Jump Street when he was 19, although [...] "You're So Vain" [...] is their first musical collaboration. The cover originated from a jam session, with Manson explaining that they [...] "started playing old blues songs and I said, 'My record's done, but we should really do a song {{to add to the}} end of <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> a movie.'" [...] He described the cover's placement on the album as: [...] "It's like the movie's over, and this is playing at the end title credits." [...] It was later included on the soundtrack to the documentary West of Memphis. Dean Karr, who served as the photographer on Manson's cover shoot for the March 2012 issue of Revolver, was commissioned to create the album's cover art. He had previously worked on the artwork accompanying Antichrist Superstar. However, the cover image would later be revealed to be the work of photographer Lindsay Usich, with Karr's photography being used for the album's first single, [...] "No Reflection".|$|E

Users of the 4chan board [...] "/b/" [...] posted manipulated images, fake celebrity testimonials, and other content relating to bikini bridges on social networks such as Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter.

Cesare G.
