5|$|On 20 June, Ohioan {{returned}} another load {{of troops}} that included Base Hospital 98, and the 20th Engineers. By the time Ohioan had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 16 September 1919, Ohioan <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> home 8,383 healthy and wounded men. USS Ohioan was decommissioned on 6 October 1919, {{and returned to}} American-Hawaiian.|$|E

5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> {{out some}} joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1781, Zong was {{purchased}} by the master of William, {{on behalf of a}} syndicate of Liverpool merchants. The members of the syndicate were Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall and William, James and John Gregson. William Gregson had an interest in 50slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780. He served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762. By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> 58,201 Africans to slavery in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to suggestions that the U.S. launch a military offensive against the alleged terrorists' sanctuary in Yemen, The Washington Post noted that Yemeni forces equipped with U.S. weapons and intelligence <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out two major raids against AQAP {{shortly before the}} bombing attempt, and that the terror group may have lost top leaders in a December 24, 2009 airstrike.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Johnston's {{connections}} with the University of Washington (where he <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out his masters and doctoral research) are remembered by a memorial fund that established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within {{what is now the}} department of Earth and Space Sciences. By {{the time of the first}} anniversary of his death, the fund had exceeded $30,000. Known as the 'David A. Johnston Memorial Fellowship for Research Excellence', a number of awards of this fellowship have been made over the years since it was launched.|$|E
5|$|Several {{portions}} of current NY21 south of Naples <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> designations prior to 1930. In 1924, the Andover–Hornell segment was designated {{as part of}} NY17; at the same time, the short piece between modern NY415 {{and the center of}} Wayland became part of NY4. By 1926, the portion connecting Wayland to Naples was included in the new NY52. NY4 was renumbered to NY2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{but later}} rumours {{included}} that {{during her first}} voyage, Centaur had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese prisoners of war back to Australia for interrogation, and consequently had been marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese. Centaur <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> 10 prisoners of war on her return voyage from New Guinea, but as they were all wounded personnel, transporting them on a hospital ship was legal.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' All-American {{tailback}} Lee Suggs {{had suffered}} a season-ending injury {{in the first game}} of the season, but freshman Kevin Jones <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> the offense for the season, and continued to perform well in the post-season Gator Bowl game. With a 5-yard run from Jones and a 55-yard pass from Grant Noel to André Davis, Tech took a 1713 lead going into the fourth quarter. But the lead quickly evaporated on a 77-yard catch and run from Chris Rix to Javon Walker.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E

5|$|The first hydrogen-filled balloon {{was invented}} by Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen {{provided}} the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; {{the first of which}} had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> electric trams, and it {{was expected}} that the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship <b>had</b> <b>carried</b> thirty extra marines, {{and this was}} probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes {{seem to have been}} easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet.|$|E
