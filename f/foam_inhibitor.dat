40|$|Abstract. Taking {{the process}} of Argon oxygen {{smelting}} low-carbon ferrochrome as the research object using the multi-rules fuzzy control, the signal of sound intensity is divided into different segments. According to the different segments,control the oxygen flow rate, nitrogen flow rate, the height of Oxygen lance and the addition amount of <b>foam</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> complete {{the design of the}} fuzzy controller, then carries on the simulation under MATLAB. The simulation results show that in different segments, the time of the system achieve stability is different, but when the sound intensity stability in 30 - 50 normal range and the system adjustment time in 3 - 5 min is a relatively stable system and able to suppress spillage occurs quickly...|$|E
40|$|Foam inhibitors (FI) s are {{included}} in lubricant formulations to reduce foam tendency and stability. However, light-based automatic particle counters record some FI droplets as contaminants. In order to meet stringent cleanliness goals, {{the effects of the}} FI dispersion on ISO 4406 particle counts must be minimized. It has been shown previously that particle counts resulting from FIs can be reduced by filtration, but it is unclear if smaller FI droplets are also removed and how this may affect lubricant foaming. To perform this research, three test stations were constructed. We assembled a lubricant blending station that provides control over blending parameters such as, temperature, impeller speed, and container size. We obtained and repaired a nonoperational Koehler Dual Bath Foaming Characteristics Apparatus and developed replacement/alternative components for the apparatus that allowed us to conduct ASTM D 892 foaming characterizations. Finally, we designed and constructed a filter station that circulates, filters, and particle counts fluids. The station includes an inline particle counter, adjustable flow rate, and accepts fluid viscosities ranging from 15 to 250 cSt. A base oil and <b>foam</b> <b>inhibitor</b> are circulated through the apparatus; fluid samples are taken as filtration progresses and then tested for foaming in accordance with ASTM D 892. For each case, we characterize the effect of the inhibitor on fluid cleanliness and the effect of filter passes on particle counts and foam tendency/stability. These effects are investigated across two filter sizes and four additive chemistries. The results provide information about the relationships between additive chemistry, filter media, optically-detected oil cleanliness, and FI effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Lubricating and {{antifoaming}} additives in aircraft lubricating oils may {{impede the}} escape of small bubbles {{from the oil}} by forming shells of liquid with a quasi-solid or gel structure around the bubbles. The rates of rise of small air bubbles, up to 2 millimeters in diameter, were measured at room temperature in an undoped oil, in the same oil containing <b>foam</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and in an oil containing lubricating additives. The apparent diameter of the air bubbles was measured visually through an ocular micrometer on a traveling telescope. The bubbles in the undoped oil obeyed Stokes' Law, the rate of rise being proportional to {{the square of the}} apparent diameter and inversely proportional to the viscosity of the oil. The bubbles in the oils containing lubricating additives or <b>foam</b> <b>inhibitors</b> rose more slowly than the rate predicted by Stokes 1 Law from the apparent diameter, and the rate of rise decreased as the length of path the bubbles traveled increased. A method is derived to calculate the thickness of the liquid shell which would have to move with the bubbles in the doped oils to account for the abnoi'I!l 8. lly slow velocity. The maximum thickness of this shell, calculated from the velocities observed, was equal to the bubble radius...|$|R
40|$|Use of amine {{for removal}} of carbon dioxide, CO 2, from {{natural gas is}} the most common method. In several of these removal units, {{operational}} problems because of foaming are reported. Further examination of these problems will in most cases show that the problem is not foaming, but will however be temporarily fixed by adding <b>foam</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> <b>Foaming</b> in amine based CO 2 removal plants is known {{to be one of the}} main challenges in daily operation. Foaming can lead to entrainment of liquids into downstream process equipment, and might lead to a situation where the process specifications for CO 2 cannot be met. A robust design of process equipment such as separators, contacting columns and internals is always necessary to prevent heavy foaming and unstable operation. This thesis will discuss the foaming problematic in chemical absorption plants, how foam is formed and how surfactants and contaminants can affect the foam stability and foaming tendency. There are several different methods for characterizing foams. Some of these will also be discussed. Experiments will be performed at Statoils Research Centre at Rotvoll in Trondheim. By using chemicals and contaminants that can be found in amine systems, foaming tendency, foam stability and drainage will be evaluated. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to improve {{antibiotic}} elution by increasing the porosity and not to just increase the porosity. In terms of obtaining a better elution, the mixing drill piece seemed to be an efficient method. In this study, hydrogen peroxide <b>inhibitored</b> <b>foam</b> creation. If dextran or glycine type space fillers, which have previously been proven to increase elution rates [12, 21]. are mixed with bone cement with our cement mixing device, it may be possible to obtain a more favorable elution efficacy.|$|R
40|$|Background: Surfactants {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} raw materials used in various industrial fields as emulsifiers, corrosion <b>inhibitors,</b> <b>foaming</b> agents, detergent products, and so on. However, commercial surfactant production is costly, and its demand is steadily increasing. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of typical strains of Bacillus sp. to produce biosurfactants through fermentation. It also included the investigation of the effect of initial glucose concentration and the carbon to nitrogen ratio. Results: The biosurfactant yield was in the range of 1 – 2. 46  g/L at initial glucose concentrations of 10 – 70  g/L. The optimum fermentation condition was achieved at a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 12. 4, with a decrease in surface tension of up to 27  mN/m. Conclusions: For further development and industrial applications, the modified Gompertz equation is proposed to predict the cell mass and biosurfactant production as a goodness of fit was obtained with this model. The modified Gompertz equation was also extended to enable the excellent prediction of the surface tension...|$|R
