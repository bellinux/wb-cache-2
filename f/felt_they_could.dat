5|$|The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012. The Yankees {{needed a}} top-tier {{starting}} pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford {{to part with}} Pineda because of their depth of top-tier pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan Walker.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days were}} {{dedicated}} towards shooting the pre-title sequence. It was filmed on location at Hedsor House in Buckinghamshire. The helicopter scenes took place inside an actual helicopter taking flight with some cast members on board, {{which would make}} the sequence more genuine as opposed to having the cast members sitting inside next to a green screen. The fight sequences between Sarkisiian's and Mani's men were orchestrated and performed by stunt coordinator Chrispin Leyfield and his stunt team, as {{there was very little}} time to train conventional actors. Director Alrick Riley wanted the fight sequences to be performed in the same style as in the Jason Bourne films. The abandoned warehouse used to hold Harry and Ruth were filmed in an abandoned leather factory near London Bridge. One of the meetings between Lucas and Sarah Caufield were originally intended to be shot on the London Eye, a location the producers had never used before. However, due to restrictions the filming crew <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not follow, it was shot in South Bank, opposite the Houses of Parliament, instead.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the {{remaining}} ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face {{to make it look}} appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E
25|$|Balok {{explains}} that he was merely testing the Enterprise and its crew to discover their true intentions. He had read the Enterprise computer records but <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been a deception. He created his dummy alter-ego, knowing his true appearance would never frighten anyone.|$|E

25|$|Coogan {{provided}} an eight-page witness {{statement to the}} Leveson Inquiry and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence. He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Old Pro's {{employees}} {{worked the}} bar or {{the box office}} or ship's maintenance to find themselves one day treading her stage. After two years of waiting, Ki <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> wait no longer. No matter how much it cost to stage an original show, {{the time had come}} to reward their hard work and dedication.|$|E
25|$|NAWSA <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} {{tolerate}} the radical tactics employed and {{advocated by the}} Congressional Union, {{and they wanted to}} officially sever their ties. Paul and Burns did not want to start a completely separate organization that could potentially rival NAWSA and hinder progress in the movement, so they tried on numerous occasions to initiate negotiations with NAWSA leaders. Despite their efforts, the Congressional Union officially split from NAWSA on February 12, 1914.|$|E

25|$|Shultz was {{an early}} {{advocate}} for the presidential candidacy of George W. Bush, whose father, George H. W. Bush, had served as Reagan's vice president. In April 1998, Shultz hosted a meeting at which George W. Bush discussed his views with policy experts including Michael Boskin, John Taylor and Condoleezza Rice, who were evaluating possible Republican candidates to run for President in 2000. At {{the end of the}} meeting, the group <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> support a Bush candidacy, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race.|$|E
25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon. Dr. Steve Olvey, CART Director of Medical Affairs, would later report that two drivers felt dizzy and disoriented after running their cars at over , and that they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not control their cars. The identities of the two drivers were not disclosed, but Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi later claimed they experienced the symptoms. Adrian Fernandez also reported to the media he was experiencing dizziness. Olvey said in his 25 years of working in motorsports, {{it was a problem}} he had never experienced.|$|E
25|$|UPS had seriously {{underestimated the}} union's {{capacity}} {{to wage a}} strike. Most importantly, UPS officials simply did not believe a strike would occur. But company officials also did not {{realize the importance of}} the union's early mobilization efforts, believed the union was too divided between the Carey and Hoffa camps to wage an effective strike, and believed thousands of Teamsters would cross the picket line to return to work. As the strike began, many UPS executives <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pressure Carey into offering the company's final offer to the Teamster membership and that the members would accept this offer.|$|E
50|$|Probably most significantly, {{strategic}} planners at the Xerox Systems Group (XSG) <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{not compete}} against other workstation makers such as Apollo Computer or Symbolics. The Xerox name alone was considered their greatest asset, {{but it did}} not produce customers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{plan for}} a {{substantial}} festival in 2013 was cancelled because of difficulties over insurance caused by previous year's flooding.

60|$|Ambrose {{looked at}} the big dog as if {{he thought it would}} be a serious undertaking, but he had known and loved Spring as his brother's {{property}} ever since his memory began, and he scarcely <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be separable for weal or woe.|$|R
25|$|For the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth {{were cast}} as the {{original}} detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Detective Mike Logan. The producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser. Noth and Michael Madsen were candidates {{for the role of}} Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead. Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.|$|E
25|$|Early {{completely}} artificial canals, across fairly flat countryside, {{would get}} round {{a small hill}} or depression by simply detouring (contouring) around it. As engineers became more ambitious {{in the types of}} country they <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> overcome, locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time. Later still, as construction techniques improved, engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels, cuttings, aqueducts or embankments, or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts. However, locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions, and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways.|$|E
25|$|After the massacre, {{the village}} was {{practically}} abandoned {{for a number of}} years and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous mass graves they had helped to dig. With the gradual return to democracy that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the survivors <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> begin to talk about the killings without fearing for their lives. Accusations were filed with the authorities in 1992 and, in 1993, a criminal investigation was launched. However, faced with delays and other irregularities in the proceedings, and stonewalled by a National Reconciliation Law that granted amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala's domestic legal remedies were ineffective in this case and consequently decided to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the supranational human rights arm of the Organisation of American States, in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The Victorians were {{impressed}} by science and progress and <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> improve society {{in the same way}} as they were improving technology. Britain was the leading world center for advanced engineering and technology. Its engineering firms were in worldwide demand for designing and constructing railways.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Meredith did no combing down or {{pitching}} into. He {{sat down}} and gathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them, tenderly and wisely. They were overcome with remorse and shame, and <b>felt</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> never be so silly and thoughtless again.|$|R
25|$|Union {{recognition}} {{became the}} biggest issue in the strike. The workers <b>felt</b> that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.|$|R
25|$|Parallel to {{this success}} ran Toyota’s feud with future tag-team partner Toshiyo Yamada. Initially, {{following}} Tokyo Sweethearts' success, the AJW braintrust <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{well be the}} new Beauty Pair or Crush Gals. However, Toyota's real chemistry came not with Shimoda but with Yamada, whose style was unlike Toyota's and provided more of a contrast. Yamada was a slightly built, short-haired, kicking specialist, who idolized both Chigusa Nagayo and Akira Maeda. Unlike other wrestlers who rely on kicks and submissions, Yamada could also work the rapid-paced matches and was accomplished at building to near-falls with repeated kick-outs at the last possible moment. To begin with, however, Toyota and Yamada were opponents rather than partners. Between 1989 and 1991 they wrestled many times. At the start of 1992, the two won their first tag team championship when they defeated KAORU and Lady Apache in Tokyo on January 19 for the UWA Women's World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|The young bishop Luka (Voino-Yasenetsky), {{a founder}} of the Tashkent {{university}} and its first professor of medicine, chief surgeon at the university and a brilliant sermonizer. He staid loyal to the Patriarch and he was first imprisoned in Tashkent in 1923, due to influence of the Renovationists who <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not compete with him. He was officially accused of treasonous ties to foreign agents in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and he was exiled to the distant northern-Siberian town of Eniseisk for three years. After he returned, he was arrested again in 1927 and exiled to Arkhangelsk without trial for another three years. He was loyal to Sergii. He was arrested again in 1937 and suffered his worst imprisonment in the subsequent years when he was tortured for two years (including beatings, interrogations that lasted for weeks, and food deprivation) in fruitless NKVD attempts to have him sign confessions. When this failed, he was deported to northern Siberia. In 1941 after the war broke out, his unique expertise in treating infected wounds caused the state to bring him to Krasnoyarsk and make him chief sturgeon at the main military hospital. He was honoured at a ceremony in December 1945 with a medal for service he had given to war medicine. During the service he criticized the regime for locking him for so many years and preventing him from exercising his talents to save more. He became archbishop of Tambov after the war. He was given the Stalin Prize in 1946 for his new and enlarged addition of his book on infected wounds; he donated the prize money to war orphans. His case was also significant because of his survival.|$|E
500|$|Comparing {{the ending}} scene {{to those of}} {{previous}} series of Blackadder in which the main characters were also killed, the writer Richard Curtis commented that [...] "I think it was by chance that [...] ended with Blackadder being killed ... but series four, we did do it very much on purpose." [...] He {{said that he and}} Elton <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering [...] "if we did do that ... it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War".|$|E
