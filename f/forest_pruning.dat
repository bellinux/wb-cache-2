50|$|On the Gulf coastal plain, {{maritime}} forest {{consists of}} a mosaic of forests and shrublands on barrier islands and strands. It occurs in sheltered areas behind coastal dunes and grasslands. Forests are dominated by a mixture of needle-leaved and broad-leaved evergreen trees, including sand pine (Pinus clausa), slash pine (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), pignut hickroy (Carya glabra), and sand hickroy (Carya pallida).

40|$|The proper {{method for}} branch removal is a long-standing {{question}} in forestry. If the branch is cut {{flush with the}} stem, a larger wound results, but if the branch is cut further from the stem, the resultant clearwood production will be less. Both alternatives have implications for tree health and wood quality. A long, international history of <b>forest</b> <b>pruning</b> research generally indicates that a cut parallel {{and close to the}} stem will maximize clearwood production without excessive stem decay. Some exceptions exist for species where potential for stem decay is high. The method recommended in most guidelines for all types of pruning is an outside branch collar approach based primarily on a small number of observational studies. However, maintaining tree health and maximizing clearwood production are not mutually exclusive and a cut close to the stem can meet both objectives. Alternative approaches to branch removal may be useful for other objectives...|$|E
40|$|Aims Urban {{land use}} has {{dramatically}} changed ecosystem functions especially carbon sequestration and storage in the built-up area. Our {{objective was to}} assess carbon sequestration and storage by estimating the biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) of urban vegetation including trees, shrubs and lawns with consideration {{of the effects of}} garden management (pruning and mowing). Methods Biomass and NPP from all trees, shrubs and lawns were estimated from 346 random quadrats. Allometric equations were used to calculate tree biomass from diameter at breast height and total height. An increment borer was used to measure trunk increment. Biomass and NPP from shrubs and lawns were estimated by destructive sampling. Management activities were recorded through actual measurements and the records of gardeners. Important findings Trunk growth rate of individual urban trees is two times that in native <b>forest.</b> <b>Pruning</b> accounts for 30 % of tree NPP. Carbon sequestration per unit of Taizhou built-up area is estimated to be 2. 1 × 103 kg C·hm– 2 ·a– 1 (with trees, shrubs and lawns contributing 64 %, 9 % and 27 %, respectively), which is lower than native forest. We infer that the carbon sequestration ability of Taizhou built-up area could meet the level of native evergreen broad-leaved forest if vegetation coverage is increased from 23 % to 46 %...|$|E

40|$|Random {{forests are}} {{ensemble}} learning methods introduced by Breiman (2001) that operate by averaging several decision trees {{built on a}} randomly selected subspace of the data set. Despite their widespread use in practice, the respective roles of the different mechanisms at work in Breiman's forests are not yet fully understood, neither is the tuning of the corresponding parameters. In this paper, we study the influence of two parameters, namely the subsampling rate and the tree depth, on Breiman's forests performance. More precisely, we show that fully developed sub-sampled <b>forests</b> and <b>pruned</b> (without subsampling) <b>forests</b> have similar performances, as long as respective parameters are well chosen. Moreover, experiments show that a proper tuning of subsampling or pruning lead in most cases to an improvement of Breiman's original forests errors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reticulation {{processes}} in evolution {{mean that the}} ancestral history of certain groups of present-day species is non-tree-like. These {{processes in}}clude hybridization, lateral gene transfer, and recombination. Despite the existence of reticulation, such events are relatively rare and, so, a fundamental problem for biologists is the following: Given a collection of rooted binary phylogenetic trees on sets of species that correctly represent the tree-like evolution of different parts of their genomes, what is the smallest number of “reticulation ” vertices in any network that explains {{the evolution of the}} species under consideration? It has been previously shown that this problem is NP-hard even when the collection consists of only two rooted binary phylogenetic trees. However, in this paper, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in the two-tree instance when parameterized by this smallest number of reticulation vertices.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{flows of}} branching processes with competition, which describe {{the evolution of}} general continuous state branching populations in which interactions between individuals {{give rise to a}} negative density dependence term. This generalizes the logistic branching processes studied by Lambert (Ann Appl Probab 15 (2) : 1506 – 1535, 2005). Following the approach developed by Dawson and Li (Ann Probab 40 (2) : 813 – 857, 2012), we first construct such processes as the solutions of certain flow of stochastic differential equations. We then propose a novel genealogical description for branching processes with competition based on interactive pruning of Lévy-trees, and establish a Ray–Knight representation result for these processes in terms of the local times of suitably <b>pruned</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Biomass use, {{both for}} {{electric}} and thermal energy production in higher power plants, has spread in recent times, {{due to the}} presence of several positive aspects. A large amount of residual biomass is available, due to residual product from <b>pruning,</b> <b>forest</b> maintenance and food chain. There are many ways to generate energy from these biomasses, through direct fired boilers for thermal energy production, or associating turbines for the generation of electrical power (cogeneration systems), and adsorption plants for the production of cooling power (trigeneration systems). The present paper resumes {{the state of the art}} of the available technologies for residual biomasses conversion to thermal and electrical power.

40|$|A {{forest is}} an {{ensemble}} with decision trees as members. This paper proposes a novel strategy to <b>pruning</b> <b>forest</b> to enhance ensemble generalization ability and reduce ensemble size. Unlike conventional ensemble pruning approaches, the proposed method tries {{to evaluate the}} importance of branches of trees {{with respect to the}} whole ensemble using a novel proposed metric called importance gain. The importance of a branch is designed by considering ensemble accuracy and the diversity of ensemble members, and thus the metric reasonably evaluates how much improvement of the ensemble accuracy can be achieved when a branch is pruned. Our experiments show that the proposed method can significantly reduce ensemble size and improve ensemble accuracy, no matter whether ensembles are constructed by a certain algorithm such as bagging or obtained by an ensemble selection algorithm, no matter whether each decision tree is pruned or unpruned...|$|R
40|$|Leaves deep in {{canopies}} can suddenly {{be exposed}} to increased irradiances following e. g. gap formation in <b>forests</b> or <b>pruning</b> in crops. Studies on the acclimation of photosynthesis to increased irradiance have mainly focused on the changes in photosynthetic capacity (Amax), although actual irradiance often remains below saturating level. We investigated the effect of changes in irradiance on the photosynthesis irradiance response and on nitrogen allocation in fully grown leaves of Cucumis sativus. Leaves that fully developed under low (50 µmol m- 2 s- 1) or moderate (200 µmol m- 2 s- 1) irradiance were subsequently exposed to, respectively, moderate (LM-leaves) or low (ML-leaves) irradiance or kept at constant irradiance level (LL- and MM-leaves). Acclimation of photosynthesis occurred within 7 days with final Amax highest in MM-leaves, lowest in LL-leaves and intermediate in ML- and LM-leaves, whereas full acclimation of thylakoid processes underlying photosystem II (PSII) efficiency and non-photochemical quenching occurred in ML- and LM-leaves. Dark respiration correlated with irradiance level, but not with Amax. Light-limited quantum efficiency was similar in all leaves. The increase in photosynthesis at moderate irradiance in LM-leaves was primarily driven by nitrogen import, and nitrogen remained allocated in a similar ratio to Rubisco and bioenergetics, while allocation to light harvesting relatively decreased. A contrary response of nitrogen {{was associated with the}} decrease in photosynthesis in ML-leaves. Net assimilation of LM-leaves under moderate irradiance remained lower than in MM-leaves, revealing the importance of photosynthetic acclimation during the leaf developmental phase for crop productivity in scenarios with realistic, moderate fluctuations in irradiance that leaves can be exposed t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rural {{communities}} often {{depend on}} forest resources for their livelihood, but non-sustainable extraction {{of these resources}} can result {{in the loss of}} biodiversity. To assess the impact of resource extraction on forest vegetation, we conducted a study in the dry deciduous forests adjoining the eastern boundary of the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the southern western ghats, India. Using 8, 1 –ha plots where all woody species ≥ 3. 18 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) were permanently marked with tags, we estimated the number of fresh cuttings on branches and stems at 3 –month intervals over a period of 2 years. We used these data to estimate the extraction pressure: [(total number of cuts* 100 /total number of plants in the plot) / 3] to give monthly percentages for each village. We compared vegetation structure, diversity, basal area and regeneration in sites with heavy human pressure to control plots where there was no current extraction. On average, branches and stems from 10 % of plants in a hectare of <b>forest</b> were <b>pruned</b> or cut every month. However, the mean % of branches and stems pruned or cut per month declined from 15 % to 8 % over the 2 year study period. There was lower species richness, species diversity, and mean height of trees in the disturbed site, when compared with the undisturbed sites. The basal area and regeneration of plants were also lower in the disturbed sites. Very few of the species extracted by villagers regenerated in the disturbed sites. This suggests that resource extraction is non-sustainable within the protected area and will eventuall...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problem in the Swedish forestry is damages caused by wild deer. The damages result in great consequences, not only economical due to quality and production loss, they also effect the biodiversity in the forest. The main principle in Swedish forestry is that damages should be avoided. Different measures are available to prevent and reduce already existing damages, the measures are many and of different character. The report Survey of forest damages and wild deer {{is the result of a}} cooperation with Södra forest owner association. With 50 000 members and 36 000 connected forest farms, Södra is the largest forest owner association in Sweden. The purpose of the study Survey of forest damages and wild deer is to examine and map how members within Södra experience problems caused by wild deer, what kind of help is requested from Södra and which measures are made by the members to prevent damages. The report is based on a survey sent to members within the Kinna region. The survey contained 31 questions and was sent to 152 randomly selected members. 41 answers were returned and later processed. The answers collected shows that almost every one of the respondents conducts measures to prevent unacceptable damages caused by wild deer. The most common measure is hunting. The most common measure to save value in already damaged <b>forest</b> is <b>pruning.</b> Among the measures to provide game with feed, environmental regard in connection to forestry measures is most commonly occurring. The main part of the forest owners state that they have little problems with damages caused by fallow and red deer while damages caused by elk and roe deer are more common.

How to create feed for wild game, how to save value in already damaged forests and how to avoid unacceptable damages caused by wild deer are other areas where the members want more information from the association...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 5 years wilt {{has come to}} be {{recognized}} as the most important oak disease in the upper Mississippi valley. The disease has been reported from Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri and Illinois. The fungus Chalara quercina Henry has been shown definitely to be the cause of the disease. Trees of the red oak group are killed quickly, usually within 30 to 60 days after wilt symptoms are apparent. Those of the white oak group may survive several years after infection with only a few branches being killed each year. All types of oak apparently are susceptible since all of the 28 species inoculated in the greenhouse were infected. The disease has been found on 9 of the 11 native species in Iowa. Infected trees have not been observed to recover from oak wilt. Prevention of spread of the disease has been attempted by various methods of sanitation. In general, removing diseased trees as soon as symptoms appear has been effective in stopping or retarding spread in state park and state <b>forest</b> test areas. <b>Pruning</b> experiments on trees that had only a few infected branches indicate that white oaks may often be saved by removal of such infected branches at a point well back of the latest symptoms. Frost injury, leaf blight and insect and rodent injury often result in leaf discoloration which from a distance may be mistaken for oak wilt...|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} {{formulated}} to generate {{data on the}} supply of forest raw materials, and provide a resource monitoring system to assist the Department of Forestry in exploring alternative management schemes. The specific objectives of the project were to conduct an inventory of the viphya plantations for management planning and pre-investment decisions; design and establish a permanent resources monitoring system; and formulate costed forest management optionsA resources monitoring system was installed, using specialized forestry software developed in New Zealand, where forest conditions are not unlike those in Malawi. The system consists of inventory packages to process data, and a subcompartment records system, to store data on silvicultural history, and past measurements of every subcompartmentAn inventory was then carried out. It was demonstrated that viphya has a net stocked area of 52 935 ha, and a gross standing volume over bark of some 18 600 000 m 3. The inventory also produced comprehensive data on standing volumes, past growth, and the present condition of the forest. A major achievement {{of the project was}} the training of the Department's officers who were then experienced in forest management inventoryTwo forest management options were developed and analysed as part of the project's management planning exercises. The first option explored was the establishment of a pulp and paper mill; the second was the gradual conversion of the <b>forest</b> to a <b>pruned</b> sawlog silvicultural regime, supplying solid wood for value-added processingWith its monitoring system now in place and its staff initiated in management planning for industrial plantations, the Forestry Department {{was in a position to}} investigate the sustainability and profitability of various investment proposals. Its continued ability to do so, however, was fragile; it needed to be consolidated by further training, and the database would require regular maintenance. It was very important that the Forestry Department continue to conduct management planning exercises, and to monitor forest resources, especially in view of the complexity of the current negotiations with the Birla Group on the establishment of a pulp and paper mill, and the magnitude of ongoing solid-wood processing operationsIn order to maintain and improve the monitoring system and staff skills, it was recommended that the Government work out a programme to consolidate the level of training achieved thus far, and provide further training in forest management planning and in the technical support disciplines. Malawian educational institutions should be used to implement such trainingA further question to which the Government could wish to give priority was the application of the lessons learned in resource monitoring and management planning in Malawi's other production plantation...|$|R
