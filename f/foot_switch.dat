40|$|We {{report on}} three {{different}} methods of gait event detection (toe-off and heel strike) using miniature linear accelerometers and angular velocity transducers {{in comparison to}} using standard pressure-sensitive <b>foot</b> <b>switches.</b> Detection was performed with normal and spinal-cord injured subjects. The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot linear accelerations or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as <b>foot</b> <b>switches</b> in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate (p < 0. 02). We conclude that detection based on foot linear accelerations or foot angular velocity can correctly identify the timing of IC and EC events in both normal and spinal-cord injured subjects...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are usually}} two {{three-way}} switches {{near the top}} of the floor lamp to operate the bulbs. One controls the three-way center bulb, and the other turns on one, two, or all three (or four) of the peripheral bulbs. The center bulb may be very high power (often a three-way, 100-200-300 watt bulb), where the others are usually 60 watts or less. Some models have a night light in the base operated by a <b>foot</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{equipment}} Morse {{used for}} showing {{the space program}} served him well on his other assignments, also. When he photographed the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1955 World Series, he brought a missile-tracking camera to the stadium. Forewarned that Jackie Robinson would try to steal home, Morse rigged the camera with a <b>foot</b> <b>switch</b> set to fire a hundred feet of film at ten frames a second. With his hand-held camera focused on the outfield, Morse triggered the foot button as soon as energy mounted between Robinson and the pitcher. When Robinson made the dash, Morse's camera was already running.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{collection}} of car horns sounding. The horns were taken from the band’s own cars and mounted in a box and powered by two car batteries, with a <b>foot</b> <b>switch.</b> Producer Ted Templemans slowed the horns down before adding them to the track. This same idea was first used during the band’s club sets and appeared on the Gene Simmons-recorded demo of the song, as well as the song [...] "House of Pain" [...] which preceded it on the demo. A four-measure guitar solo is played after the second and third chorus.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the user's abilities, {{different}} switches {{are available}} for different purposes, including: finger <b>switches,</b> <b>foot</b> <b>switches</b> and button switches of many different sizes and varieties.

Use of switches depends on the user's muscle tone, spasticity, visual ability, cognitive function and interests. Switch adapted toys can generate blinking or changing lights and music, speaking, vibration, noises, fans, aromatherapy, massage, songs with number, alphabet or nursery rhyme content and even voice recording and playback.|$|R

5000|$|Goodsell's Black Dog {{amplifiers}} {{differ from}} the other's because they feature a complex two-stage gain structure {{as well as a}} full 3-way tone stack. [...] Additionally, the feature can by bypassed via a <b>foot</b> <b>switch</b> resulting in an extra 20 dB of gain. The amplifier's 20 watt version is powered by two E84L/7189 tubes, while the 50 watt version is powered by two EL34 tubes. The tone associated with this amplifier is a medium-high gain sound similar to guitar amps of the 1970s. Both versions of the amp are available in head enclosures. However, only the 20 watt version, is available as a combo amp. Additionally, all Black Dog amplifiers all solid state rectified.|$|E
5000|$|These {{were the}} second series of Marshalls {{equipped}} with a master volume, which allowed for more distortion at lower volumes. Compared to the earlier [...] "Master Volume" [...] series, they offered some advantages, including the possibility to be patched internally and linked with other amplifiers. The first JCM800s were in fact Master Volume amplifiers (Models 2203 and 2204, at 100 and 50 watts respectively), repackaged in new boxes with new panels. Soon, however, the Model 2210 appeared on the market. These were equipped with two channels, which could be activated via a <b>foot</b> <b>switch,</b> allowing for separate lead and rhythm sounds. They also had an effects loop and reverb, also a first for Marshall.|$|E
5000|$|According to Akai Professional's {{official}} 1988-89 Musical Instruments catalog: [...] "The AR900 is a {{high quality}} 16-bit digital reverb with 20 preset reverb programs. Numerous variations may be created by adjusting the pre delay and the reverb time settings on the front panel. These variations can then be stored in any ofnthe 79 user memories {{for a total of}} 99 programs including the 20 presets. Programs may be selected by MIDI, a <b>foot</b> <b>switch,</b> or the infrared remote control accessory. A dual 7-band programmable graphic EQ can be used independently or in conjunction with the digital reverb to enhance the reverb sounds. The AR900 with its wide selection of useful programs has numerous application in both the studio and on stage." ...|$|E
