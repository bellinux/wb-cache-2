25|$|Stored-waveform <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> (SWIFT) is {{a method}} for the {{creation}} of excitation waveforms for FTMS. The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from the <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of selected ions. The SWIFT procedure can be used to select ions for tandem mass spectrometry experiments.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{also shows}} the time domain {{representation}} of the resulting vibration.

25|$|From a calculational {{point of}} view, the {{drawback}} {{of course is}} that one must first calculate the Fourier transforms of the boundary conditions, then assemble the solution from these, and then calculate an <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform.</b> Closed form formulas are rare, except when there is some geometric symmetry that can be exploited, and the numerical calculations are difficult because of the oscillatory nature of the integrals, which makes convergence slow and hard to estimate. For practical calculations, other methods are often used.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the study of}} <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> on finite <b>inverse</b> semigroups, {{with a focus on}} Fourier inversion theorems and FFTs for new classes of inverse semigroups. We begin by introducing four inverse semigroup generalizations of the Fourier inversion theorem for finite groups. Next, we describe a general approach to the construction of fast <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> for finite <b>inverse</b> semigroups complementary to an approach to FFTs given in previous work. Finally, we give fast <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> for the symmetric inverse monoid and its wreath product by arbitrary finite groups, as well as fast <b>Fourier</b> and <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> for the planar rook monoid, the partial cyclic shift monoid, and the partial rotation monoid.

25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E

40|$|We produce, {{on general}} {{homogeneous}} groups, an analogue {{of the usual}} Hörmander pseudodifferential calculus on Euclidean space, {{at least as far}} as products and adjoints are concerned. In contrast to earlier works, we do not limit ourselves to analogues of classical symbols, nor to the Heisenberg group. The key technique is to understand "multipliers" of any given order j, and the operators of convolution with their <b>inverse</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms,</b> which we here call convolution operators of order j. (Here a "multiplier" is an analogue of a Hörmander-type symbol a(x,ξ), which is independent of x.)
