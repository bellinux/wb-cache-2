25|$|The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Pit</b> (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is {{a gloomy}} {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov. The {{plot of the}} novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union. They attempt to dig out a huge <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> {{on the base of}} which a gigantic house will be built for the country's proletarians. The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work. The enormous <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> sucks out all of their physical and mental energy.|$|E
25|$|Eventually Voschev joins a {{group of}} workers, {{all of whom are}} much {{stronger}} than him, a fact that Voschev attributes to his exhausting quest for truth. He learns that the group will be digging an enormous <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> in which they will later construct a housing complex for the country's proletarians. Voschev also works at a slower pace than everyone else except for one man, Kozlov, whom the others make fun of for masturbating so often. Safronov, the most politically active worker at the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit,</b> complains when managements tells them to stop working for the day.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Pit</b> was {{not well}} {{received}} by Soviet officials, who saw the novel as a critique of Stalin's policies. It faced strict censorship and was not officially published in the country until 1987.|$|E

25|$|Safronov — Most {{politically}} active worker at the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit.</b> He opposes the time limits that management places on workers’ schedules and condemns other workers' attempts to contribute {{anything other than}} manual labor to the project. Safronov also dislikes Voschev’s necessity for truth. He deeply hates Kozlov.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{creative}} works, Platonov depicted {{one of the}} first state-controlled dystopias of the 20th century. The novel is often compared to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. However, both English novels were published long before a translation of The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Pit</b> became available.|$|E
25|$|Voshchev — Protagonist who is {{introduced}} in the novel immediately after being fired from a machine factory. Management claimed he did not work hard enough. He arrives at the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> with the same work ethic problem. Voshchev has a soft spot in his heart for children and does not believe they have a bright future in the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|In July 2015, it was {{reported}} that no work had been done on the site for more than two years. The excavated <b>foundation</b> <b>pits</b> were being used by local villagers as fish ponds. The developer stated that there was no further news on securing approval for the building.Furthermore, the project was scrapped in June 2016 due to environmental concerns. The no-construction zone will span a total of 199.5 square kilometers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{choice of}} {{supporting}} {{plan for a}} foundation excavation plays {{a leading role in}} the optimizing design. For those <b>foundation</b> <b>pits</b> with complex circumstances, a reasonable and optimized supporting construction should be designed to meet the requirements of the surrounding environmental factors. These factors are arranged and rated through a relatively simple analytic hierarchy process (AHP) so as to determine how they affect the design plan of the supporting system. Through ratings and comparisons of relevant factors, a rating method for different design plans is proposed based on AHP analysis. Several supporting plans for a practical excavation engineering in Kunming are analyzed and compared through above method and a reasonable and optimized design plan is selected...|$|R
25|$|Platonov's {{work is a}} {{representation}} of the conflict that arose between Russian individuals and the increasingly collectivized Soviet state in the late 1920s. The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Pit</b> critiques Joseph Stalin's domestic policies and questions the validity of any regime advocating the belief that the only existence a person can have is being one part of a whole. Finished in 1930, the novel was not published in the Soviet Union until 1987 due to censorship.|$|E
500|$|Despite these hardships a [...] {{diameter}} <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> was excavated and by 1869 a solid {{portion of}} tower rising [...] above foundation level had been completed. This was no mean feat. On one occasion eleven two-ton stones were dislodged {{from the third}} course of stonework and carried off the rock, never to be seen again. Robert Stevenson noted that this destruction occurred {{at the same height}} [...] "above the sea as the glass panes in the lantern of Smeaton's lighthouse" [...] at Eddystone.|$|E
500|$|The {{floating}} section {{consists of}} a steel box girder placed on top of ten floating pontoons. The pontoon section is anchored only at both ends, on the underwater foundation at Kauvaskallen and on Flatøy. It is fastened using flexible plate connections fastened by bolts and cables under tension. These are flexible around the horizontal axis at right angles towards the axis of the bridge, allowing for deformation caused by the tide. The fastening on Flatøy {{consists of a}} massive concrete block [...] long and [...] tall which was poured into a blast-out <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> in bedrock. Vertical pretension rock anchors have also been installed, with 12 at Klauvaskallen and 14 at Flatøy, giving [...] of support, although they were only built to increase the safety factor.|$|E

2500|$|Voschev {{returns to}} the {{worksite}} {{with all of the}} collectivize property, including its previous owners. He doesn't know how to react to Nastya's death but tells Chiklin that the peasants would like to enroll as regular workers. They realize this means that the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit</b> will have to be built even larger. Zhachev, who {{at the beginning of the}} novel vowed to kill all of the adults at Nastya's coming of age, refuses to help reconstruct the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit.</b> [...] "Communism's something for the kids," [...] Zhachev says.

Voschev, who followed the peasant claiming ownership of the empty coffins, returns to the worksite to announce that Kozlov and Safronov are dead. The workers steal Nastya's empty coffins and bury the men in them. She doesn’t understand why someone who is not alive is given preference.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the main results of the work of Mediaeval {{expedition}} in Kharkiv Oblast. At the Pyatnytske settlement (Saltiv archaeological culture, the middle of the 8 th — the middle of the 10 th c. AD) the research was ongoing at the Trench 3 at {{the northern part of the}} site, where the remains of a dwelling with the kiln made of stones, two husbandry structures and several husbandry pits were studied. At the Trench 9, besides the mediaeval cultural layer the Bronze Age deposits of Zrubna culture of the 14 th — 12 th c. BC were found. At the Mokhnach hill-fort three Early Mediaeval dwellings, two granaries, a cellar, a seasonal kitchen, and several husbandry pits were additionally researched. A new settlement with the materials of Saltiv culture is found at a distance of two kilometers to the north from the hill-fort. <b>Foundation</b> <b>pits</b> of the ancient dwellings are well recognizable on its surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the cost of soil nail {{supporting}} to deep <b>foundation</b> <b>pits</b> and ensure safety as well as stability, a model is established to optimize the design parameters for soil nail wall. This paper is concerned with the analysis of soil nail channel number, diameter, length, horizontal spacing, vertical spacing and dip angle. For parameter optimization design of soil nail wall is a complex problem, the traditional method is easy to fall into local optima. The genetic algorithm is a global optimization method. To some extent it has the drawback of appearing premature convergence and oscillation so as to slow iterative process. Therefore, a forward and backward search algorithm is proposed, which is combined with genetic algorithm. Furthermore some improvement measures are put forward by means of improved hybrid genetic algorithm. As a result engineering studies arrive at an optimum design. It shows that the optimized design results of IHGA not only ensure the stability of foundation, but greatly reduce the cost of engineering materials...|$|R
2500|$|Platonov {{believed}} that he was fighting for the future. According to him, children were the reason that he and others were working toward socialism. This theme is easily observable in the quotations of Voschev and Zhachev. In this way, Nastya serves {{as a symbol of}} the Soviet Union's future. She is young, intelligent, and happy, but Platonov uses her death to symbolize his worries about the country's state of affairs. The concludes The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Pit</b> with a quick note: [...] "Will our soviet socialist republic perish like Nastya or will she grow up into a whole human being, into a new historical society? … The author may have been mistaken to portray in the form of the little girl's death the end of the socialist generation, but this mistake occurred only as a result of excessive alarm on behalf of something beloved, whose loss is tantamount to the destruction not only of all the past but also of the future." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the safety}} and {{durability}} in the cement soil engineering about the pits anti-seepage, embankment impermeable walls and subgrade strengthening in the frozen regions and the retaining walls in <b>foundation</b> <b>pits,</b> the experiments on the compressibility about the cement soil under freezing-thawing cycle, infiltrated and other environmental-action conditions {{have been carried out}} and the influential laws of environmental actions on the compression parameter of cement soil have been obtained. The results show that the various environmental actions may have influences on compressibility of cement soil at different levels, and the environmental effects on the compressibility of cement soil in the engineering applications and designs, such as impermeable walls or in the frozen regions, should be taken into account, and the void ratio and the coefficient of compressibility will increase with the increase of freezing-thawing cycle times and infiltration time but the compression modulus will decrease with the increase of freezing-thawing cycle times and infiltration time so that the curve regression equation about the void ratio, the coefficient of compressibility and compression modulus varying with the freezing-thawing cycle times and the infiltration time has been established. The results are significant and valuable to the safety and the durability of cement soil engineering...|$|R

40|$|Materials {{and methods}} We have studied 15 skeletons in a {{primarily}} good state of preservation. Due to the restrictions of the <b>foundation</b> <b>pit’s</b> borders, {{not all the}} skeletons have been completely excavated. However, this did not significantly influence the precision of sex or age determination. Pelvic bones were available in all the cases but one (burial № 1). Sex was not determined for the juvenile of 18 ± 3 months, since {{we do not have}} methods for the precise determination of sex at this early age. Due to the overall well-preserved state of the skeletons, their age at time of death has been determined with relatively high accuracy. Besides determining it using traditional methods (4), we have utilized some additional ones (5 - 15). Preserved skulls brought the most accurate results in age determination (16 - 22), especially for children, where tooth eruption time is a good age indicator (23 - 25). To calculate the height of the buried individuals we applied a number of methods, utilizing the length of the so-called long tubular bones (4). Equations have been selected for specific types of proportions, determined by intermembral and tibiofemoral indices. The most universally aplicable equation turned out to be that of Debets (26). Some recent methods have also been used to make the height determination more accurate (27 - 36). All of the calculations and diagrams were processed in the Statistica 6. 0 analysis program...|$|R
