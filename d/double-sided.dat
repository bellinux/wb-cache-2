5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that <b>double-sided</b> ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion. In spite of opposition, double hulls became a requirement for Panamax and Capesize vessels in 2005.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 2014, Nintendo {{announced}} in its Nintendo Direct presentation that The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D {{would be released}} for the Nintendo 3DS in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2015. Like Ocarina of Time 3D, the remake features improved character models and stereoscopic 3D graphics, along with altered boss battles and an additional fishing minigame. A special edition featuring a pin badge, <b>double-sided</b> poster, and steelbook, was released in Europe.|$|E
5|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Jackson's King Kong, Universal Studios Home Entertainment issued a <b>double-sided</b> director's cut DVD of the film in November 2005, which featured a version of The Frighteners that was 12 minutes longer. The other side includes a documentary prepared by Jackson and WingNut Films originally for the Laserdisc release. The director's cut was also made available in HD DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} crossover between Revival and Chew {{was announced}} on February 12, 2014, and released on May 28, 2014. The idea was proposed by Chew writer John Layman, but was initially opposed {{by all the}} other creators. Layman continued to push the concept, and eventually wrote the story anyway. He emailed it to Seeley, Norton, and Chew artist Rob Guillory, and after reading it they all agreed to participate. It was constructed as a <b>double-sided</b> book with two stories, one by each creative team.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} at Tilsit gave Napoleon time {{to organize}} his empire. One {{of his major}} objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the Kingdom of Portugal, which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the War of the Oranges in 1801, Portugal adopted a <b>double-sided</b> policy. At first, John VI agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Three {{parallel}} {{train tracks}} {{pass through the}} station, with two <b>double-sided</b> platforms between the central track and the outer tracks. The edges of the platforms are labelled platform 1 and 2, and platform 3 and 4, {{in such a way}} that the two outer tracks are accessible from platforms 1 and 4, and the central track, usually used by trains that terminate and reverse at Arnos Grove station, is accessible from platforms 2 and 3. Platforms 1 and 2 are designated for trains to Cockfosters while platforms 3 and 4 are for trains to Central London.|$|E
5|$|Only twenty originals, copies, or {{abstract}} {{versions of}} royal charters of {{the kings of}} the Crovan dynasty are known. Of these, only three date to the reign of Magnúsone of which, a grant to Conishead Priory in 1256, is the only original royal charter of the dynasty in existence. Important devices attached to royal charters were <b>double-sided</b> waxen seals, used to authentic such instruments. Although no seals of the dynasty now survive, there exists several seventeenth- and eighteenth-century descriptions and depictions of ones believed to have belonged to Magnús' uncle Rǫgnvaldr, and brother Haraldr. This limited evidence suggests that, in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries, the kings of the dynasty bore a sailing ship upon their seals, which would have likely represented the clinker-built galley utilised in the Isles at the time. Borne by men whose strength lay {{in the power of}} armed galley-fleets, such a symbol would have represented their authority in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|The DVD was {{released}} on March 9, 2004 in widescreen and fullscreen editions, on a <b>double-sided</b> disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg. Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled Schindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a plexiglass case. The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet. As part of its 20th anniversary, the movie {{was released}} on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Robert M. Strozier Library is Florida State's main library. It {{is located}} in the {{historic}} central area of the campus adjacent to Landis Green and occupies seven floors. Strozier's collections focus on the humanities, social sciences, business, and education. The facility has been renovated several times. In 2008, the lower floor reopened as the graduate- and faculty-focused Scholars Commons. In 2010, the main floor was transformed into an undergraduate-focused Learning Commons. The most recent renovation added smart study rooms, an enlarged computer area, new circulation areas, a tutoring center, and the nation's first <b>double-sided</b> Starbucks. Strozier also houses the Special Collections and Archives division and Heritage Protocol. Strozier Library is open 24-hours on weekdays during the fall and spring semesters. The library closes early on Friday and Saturday nights and maintains decreased hours during the summer semester.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a <b>double-sided</b> panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{panels and}} other {{fragments}} of Lochner's larger works are today spread across various museums and collections. Two surviving <b>double-sided</b> wing panels from an altarpiece {{with images of}} saints are in the London's National Gallery and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne (this now sawn through so both sides can be displayed on a wall). The wings of the Last Judgement originally had six parts, painted on both sides, but have been sawn into twelve individual pictures, now divided between the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and the Städel Museum in Frankfurt. It is probably from early in his career, but in subject matter and background differs from other extant and attributed works. While the elements are arranged in typical harmony, the composition and tone are unusually dark and dramatic. The Crucifixion is also an early work and reminiscent of late medieval painting. It has a heavily ornamented gilded background and the smooth flowing quality of the 'soft' Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Manga {{released}} the film on home video in the United States with a newly commissioned dub that adhered {{closer to the}} original script with the correct names restored. The DVD preserves the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and is non-anamorphic. It additionally features remastered audio and picture, but contains no extras. The same company later released a new special edition DVD of Cagliostro in 2006. The disc is <b>double-sided</b> with the film on side A and the extras on side B. It includes a new digital transfer; Manga's English dub in 2.0 and 5.1 surround plus Japanese, Spanish, and French language tracks in mono; the complete film in storyboard format, accompanied by Japanese audio with English subtitles; an original Japanese trailer; a sketch and still gallery; a 26-minute interview with animation director Yasuo Ōtsuka, and animated menus. The film is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen; however, the opening credits have been heavily re-edited to remove the Japanese credits, instead using selected still-frames of scenes that appear without Japanese writing. The English-translated names are superimposed over these stills. This change was negatively received by fans of the film. Both DVD releases are out-of-print, with Manga no longer owning the U.S. film rights.|$|E
5|$|Little Busters! was {{the first}} Key title to receive {{coverage}} in an entire issue of Dengeki G's Festival!, a special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine which is published in irregular intervals each year by ASCII Media Works; the issue in question was the ninth, published on June 30, 2007. Along with a full 80 pages of information on Little Busters!, the magazine came bundled with a <b>double-sided</b> hug pillowcase, a small cell phone cleaner which could also attach to a cell phone, and a B5 size jigsaw puzzle. ASCII Media Works published the third volume of another special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine named Dengeki G's Festival! Deluxe on June 30, 2008 which had a focus on Little Busters! Ecstasy. Along with again containing about eighty pages of information pertaining to the visual novel, the magazine also comes bundled with an ergonomic mousepad, a jigsaw puzzle, and a deck of playing cards. The third volume of another magazine in the Festival! line, Dengeki G's Festival! Comic, was sold on July 26, 2008 with Rin and Dorj on the cover, and the magazine came bundled with a hug pillowcase, a notepad, and a B2 size poster.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a <b>double-sided</b> ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakdown}} {{voltage can be}} increased by using one-sided partially metallized films, or the {{breakdown voltage}} of the capacitor can be increased by using <b>double-sided</b> metallized films. <b>Double-sided</b> metallized films also can be combined with internal series-connected capacitors by partial metallization. These multiple technique designs are especially used for high-reliability applications with polypropylene films.|$|E
25|$|The <b>double-sided</b> metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} {{electrodes}} {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with <b>double-sided</b> metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a <b>double-sided</b> metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{manufacturers}} introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3½-inch floppy disk (actually 90mm wide) a.k.a. Micro diskette, Micro disk, or Micro floppy, similar to a Sony design but improved to support both single-sided and <b>double-sided</b> media, with formatted capacities generally of 360 KB and 720 KB respectively. Single-sided drives shipped in 1983, and double sided in 1984. What became the most common format, the <b>double-sided,</b> high-density (HD) 1.44 MB disk drive, shipped in 1986.|$|E

Later Macs could also read and write 1.44 MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed.|$|E
25|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment has {{released}} all Miami Vice seasons on DVD for regions 1, 2, and 4. Seasons 1 & 2 were released in 2005, and seasons 3 through 5 were released in 2007. The DVD {{release of the}} series had been significantly slow due {{to one of the}} signature features of the show: the heavy integration of 1980s pop and rock music. The music was difficult to source the rights to and acquire permission to use. In the November 2004 announcement for the DVD release of the series, Universal promised that all original music in the series would be intact. On August 21, 2007 Universal announced the November 13, 2007 release of the complete series, with all five seasons on 27 single-sided DVDs. The seasons are in their own Digipak-style cases, and the set is housed in a faux alligator-skin package. Seasons 1 & 2 contained six single-sided discs, rather than the three <b>double-sided</b> discs in the initial release. The Region 2 version has different packaging, does not use <b>double-sided</b> discs, and although there are no special features stated on the packaging they are contained within the season 1 discs.|$|E
25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples to be heated more evenly. In order for a <b>double-sided</b> heating system to be successful {{it is essential that}} the two lasers are aligned so that they are both focused on the sample position. For in situ heating in diffraction experiments, the lasers need to be focused to the same point in space where the X-ray beam is focused.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{consists}} of five paintings– a central inner panel and two <b>double-sided</b> wings.
