5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms.

PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant <b>danger</b> <b>and</b> drudgery of the trek.

5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the <b>danger,</b> <b>and</b> giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E

They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E
