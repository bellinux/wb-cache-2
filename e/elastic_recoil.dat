25|$|In {{addition}} to injuries from falling and from back strains (some {{of which may}} be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur, such as finger, hand, or even arm amputations. Amputations or avulsions may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, and impact from <b>elastic</b> <b>recoil</b> if the rope breaks. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the breaking strength of common ropes, and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. The broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat elastic polymer such as common nylon can reach high speeds, and can easily sever fingers. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.|$|E

One of the final refinements that has appeared in some of the higher Neoptera (Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera) is a type of muscular or neural control system whereby a single nerve impulse causes a muscle fiber to contract multiple times; this allows the frequency of wing beats to exceed the rate at which the nervous system can send impulses. This specialized form of muscle is termed asynchronous muscle. The overall effect is that many higher Neoptera can beat their wings much faster than insects with direct flight muscles.|$|E

It will be noted, in dissecting that the lungs have shrunk away from {{the walls of the}} thorax; this collapse occurs directly an aperture is made in the thorax wall, and is in part due to their extreme elasticity. In life the cavity of the thorax forms an air-tight box, between which and the lungs is a slight space, the pleural cavity (pl.c.) lined by a moist membrane, which is also reflected, over the lungs. The thorax wall is muscular and bony, and resists the atmospheric pressure on its outer side, so that the lungs before this is cut through are kept distended {{to the size of the}} thoracic cavity by the pressure of the air within them. In inspiration (or breathing-in) the ribs are raised by the external intercostal (Anglice, between-ribs, e.i.c.m.) and other allied muscles, and the diaphragm (dia.) contracts and becomes flatter; the air is consequently sucked, in as the lungs follow the movement of the thorax wall. In expiration the intercostals and diaphragm relax and allow the <b>elastic</b> <b>recoil</b> of the lungs to come into play. The thoracic wall is simultaneously depressed by the muscles of the abdominal area, the diaphragm thrust forwards, as the result of the displacement and compression of the alimentary viscera thus brought about.

MethodsFrom October 2006 to December 2010, 31 patients with CLI with below-the-knee TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C and D lesions at the popliteal (n = 17, 54. 8 %) and distal tibioperoneal trunk (n = 14, 45. 2 %) bifurcations, with suboptimal primary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty results (residual stenosis > 30 %, <b>elastic</b> <b>recoiling,</b> or dissection), with at least two-vessel runoff to the foot (present or after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), free of aortoiliac arterial disease, and at high surgical risk (more than three risk factors) were treated with the Nile Croco coronary bifurcated stent. Study end points included technical success, immediate and midterm primary and secondary patency rates, clinical improvement, and limb salvage. ResultsTechnical success was achieved in all patients (100 %) without any intraoperative complications. Early complications included an acute stent occlusion and an acute compartment syndrome for a collateral arterial branch perforation. Median follow-up was 12. 1 months (range, 1 - 32). Primary and secondary patency rates were 96. 7 % and 86. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 67. 2 %- 94. 6 %) at 30 days and and 100 % and 96. 6 % (95 % CI, 78. 0 %- 99. 5 %) at 1 year, respectively. Clinical improvement (an upward shift of at least two Rutherford categories) was achieved in 28 patients (90. 3 %). A major amputation was required in one patient (3. 2 %). The overall limb salvage rate at 1 year was 96. 7 % (95 % CI, 78. 6 %- 99. 5 %). ConclusionsPreliminary data suggest that the Nile Croco bifurcated stent for below-the-knee angioplasty in selected patients with CLI is associated with high rates of technical success, early and midterm patency, and clinical improvement. Limb salvage rates are acceptable for this technically highly challenging anatomy, yet further studies with larger patient populations are necessary to validate these results...|$|R
40|$|The <b>elastic</b> nuclear <b>recoil</b> signal, {{being under}} intense {{scrutiny}} by multiple underground experiments, {{can be interpreted}} either as coming from the interaction of nuclei with WIMP dark matter or from the scattering of new species of MeV-energy neutrinos. The most promising model for the latter case is a neutrino ν_b that interacts with baryon number, and with a flux sourced by the oscillations of regular solar ^ 8 B neutrinos. We re-analyze this model {{in light of the}} latest experimental results. In contrast to the light-DM interpretation of various tentative positive signals (anomalies) that is now seriously challenged by the negative results of the LUX experiment, the neutrino interpretation remains a viable explanation to most of the anomalies. Considering future prospects, we show that the superCDMS experiment alone, when equipped with Ge and Si detectors, will be able to detect ν_b and discriminate the model from a light DM interpretation.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of pulmonary vascular pressure measurements {{is of great}} diagnostic and prognostic relevance. However, there is variability of zero leveling procedures, and the current recommendation of end-expiratory reading {{may not always be}} adequate. A review of physiological and anatomical data, supported by recent imaging, leads to the practical recommendation of zero leveling at the cross-section of three transthoracic planes, which are, respectively midchest frontal, transverse through the fourth intercostal space, and midsagittal. As for the inevitable respiratory pressure swings, end-expiratory reading at functional residual capacity allows for minimal influence of <b>elastic</b> lung <b>recoil</b> on pulmonary pressure reading. However, hyperventilation is associated with changes in end-expiratory lung volume and increased intrathoracic pressure, eventually exacerbated by expiratory muscle contraction and dynamic hyperinflation, all increasing pulmonary vascular pressures. This problem is amplified in patients with obstructed airways. With the exception of dynamic hyperinflation states, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that negative inspiratory and positive expiratory intrathoracic pressures cancel each other out, so averaging pulmonary vascular pressures over several respiratory cycles is most often preferable. This recommendation may be generalized for the purpose of consistency and makes sense, as pulmonary blood flow measurements are not corrected for phasic inspiratory and expiratory changes in clinical practice.

40|$|AbstractThe {{release of}} {{surfactant}} from alveolar type II cells {{is essential to}} lower the surface tension in the lung and to facilitate inspiration. However, the factors controlling dispersal and diffusion of this hydrophobic material are still poorly understood. Here we report that release of surfactant from the fused vesicle, termed lamellar body (LB), resisted mechanical forces applied by optical tweezers: At constant trapping force, the probability to expand LB contents, i. e., to “pull” surfactant into the extracellular fluid, increased with time after LB fusion with the plasma membrane, consistent with slow fusion pore expansion in these cells. Elevations of the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]c) had a similar effect. Inasmuch as surfactant did not disintegrate in the extracellular space, this method permitted {{for the first time}} the determination of <b>elastic</b> and <b>recoil</b> properties of the macromolecular complex, yielding a spring constant of ∼ 12. 5 pN/μm. This is the first functional evidence that release of hydrophobic material is mechanically impeded and occurs in an “all-or-none” fashion. This mode of release is most probably the result of cohesive forces of surfactant, combined with adhesive forces and/or retaining forces exerted by a constrictive fusion pore acting as a regulated mechanical barrier, withstanding forces up to 160 pN. In independent experiments equiaxial strain was exerted on cells without optical tweezers. Strain facilitated surfactant release from preexisting fused vesicles, consistent with the view of mechanical impediments during the release process, which can be overcome by cell strain...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} terrorist threats and illegal proliferation of nuclear material and technology, {{there is a}} need for increased research in the area of detection of smuggled fissile material, some of which is designated by the International Atomic Energy Agency as special fissile material. This thesis focuses on a hypothetical scenario in which a terrorist organization has managed to smuggle an amount of special fissile material onto a personal recreational watercraft and sail it into a marina. If the boat could be forced to go through a detector system, then the contents could be interrogated and a determination made of whether any special fissile material was aboard. This thesis examines the hypothesis that active interrogation may be used successfully in the detection of special fissile material in such an environment. It shows that it is feasible to use an active neutron system to detect a significant quantity of special fissile material onboard a small boat via the differential dieaway technique. The MCNP Monte Carlo transport code was used to simulate the use of a pulsed neutron generator to induce fission in the fissile material and then estimate the detector response. The detector modeled was based on <b>elastic</b> scattering-induced <b>recoil</b> protons using pure hydrogen gas. There was a significant difference between the system with and without the presence of fissile material, and the estimated detector response for the system with fissile material present was shown to be sufficiently greater than the response due to background radiation only.

The reproducibility of the total lung capacity (TLC) measured by body plethysmography was good, with a mean coefficient of variation of 1. 8 ± 0. 9 % (SD). The following variables were calculated from the P-V curves: the recoil pressures measured at TLC and 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50 % TLC, {{as well as the}} compliance at functional residual capacity. For all the variables considered the intraseries variance was similar to the intarsenies variance so that all the individual results were pooled together. For each variable a coefficient of variation was calculated for each subject, as well as an F ratio to compare the interindividual differences to the intraindividual differences. For the variables obtained from the expiratory P-V curve, the lowest coefficient of variation was found for <b>elastic</b> lung <b>recoil</b> pressure, 90 % TLC (6. 6 ± 2. 6 %, mean ± SD). The reproducibility of the inspiratory P-V curve was found to be somewhat better than that of the expiratory one, with a coefficient of variation of 3. 4 ± 0. 8 % at 90 % TLC. In absolute terms at that same level, the mean standard error of measurements was 1. 2 cm H 2 O for the expiratory curves and 0. 8 cm H 2 O for the inspiratory ones. It is concluded that in terms of reproducibility the best index of lung elasticity is the recoil pressure measured at 90 % TLC and that the inspiratory curve is even better than the expiratory one.
