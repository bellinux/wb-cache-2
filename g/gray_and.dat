Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell became friends with Mudvayne vocalist Chad <b>Gray,</b> <b>and</b> they talked about the possibility of forming a supergroup. The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, <b>Gray</b> <b>and</b> Maxwell had brainstormed five band names.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{to what extent}} authenticity is related but distinct from <b>Gray,</b> 1982 <b>and</b> <b>Gray,</b> 1985 behavioural inhibition/approach systems and Cloninger's psychobiological model (Cloninger, Svrakic, & Przybeck, 1993). Five-hundred and fifty-four adults (250 males, 304 females) completed measures of authenticity (Wood, Linley, Maltby, Baliousis, & Joseph, 2008), behavioural inhibition/activation (BIS/BAS, Carver & White, 1994) and Cloninger's temperament and character inventory (TCI-IPIP, Goldberg et al., 2006). Significant, small to moderate correlations are reported between authenticity and inhibitory and approach dimensions of <b>Gray's</b> <b>and</b> Cloninger's models. The directions of these relationships are consistent with Horney, 1945, Horney, 1951 and Maslow, 1954 descriptions of authenticity. However, dimensions of both <b>Gray's</b> <b>and</b> Cloninger's domains account for only a small 5. 7 - 18 % of the shared variance in authenticity, suggesting that authenticity is related but distinct from <b>Gray's</b> <b>and</b> Cloninger's personality dimensions...|$|R

5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected <b>Gray</b> <b>and</b> his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where <b>Gray</b> <b>and</b> his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E
5|$|John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich {{and one of}} his own supporters, to be {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect Walter's successor. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de <b>Gray,</b> <b>and</b> a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de <b>Gray,</b> <b>and</b> instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of <b>gray</b> <b>and</b> black.
