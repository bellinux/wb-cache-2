5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding {{to be the best}} Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|In April 1925 the United States Post Office issued three stamps {{commemorating the}} 150th {{anniversary of the}} Battles at Lexington and Concord. The Lexington—Concord {{commemorative}} stamps were {{the first of many}} commemoratives issued to honor the 150th anniversaries of events that surrounded America's War of Independence. The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known). This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that other locations were not involved in the battles.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force {{was not about to}} surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E
5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in 2012, and it was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed to carry a single county.|$|E

5|$|Despite these numbers, not all {{the clergy}} were {{regularly}} present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring {{fact of life in}} all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, were available for half the year. The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income. In the Diocese of Aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.|$|E

50|$|As for the Anti-Inflation Reference, the Court in 2005 {{noted that}} mention {{of it in}} the 1997 Reference was merely to {{demonstrate}} what constitutes a reviewing method.

25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} south is uniformly wealthy; {{some of the worst}} pockets of {{deprivation}} can be found in London, especially inner London, while Hastings and Bexhill-on-Sea, on the south coast, are also subject to urgent regeneration efforts.|$|E
25|$|Certain exotic organisms do {{not seem}} to be subject to aging and can live indefinitely. Examples include Tardigrades and Hydras. That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that these organisms cannot die, merely that they only die as a result of disease or injury rather than age-related {{deterioration}} (and that they are not subject to the Hayflick limit).|$|E
25|$|Of {{these many}} ranks, {{the most basic}} is species. However, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is {{guaranteed}} to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a clade, that is, the phylogeny of the organisms under discussion, {{but this is not}} a requirement.|$|E

25|$|That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} price of any good or service is simply a {{function}} of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.|$|E
25|$|Age of {{acquisition}} is not {{as important}} in comprehension activities {{as it is in}} production activities. However, that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that age of acquisition is not {{a major factor in the}} proficiency of L2. In fact studies have determined late learners to be less proficient in L2 than early learners. Functional imaging methods have revealed that holding proficiency constant leads to age of acquisition not having a large influence on representation of L2 in the brain, but there are fewer individuals achieving high proficiency at later ages of acquisition.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks took much {{of their}} designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when Alexander the Great conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European {{influences}} can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near Olbia, with only one example ever found anywhere else.|$|E

25|$|The {{tempo of}} marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches {{in their own}} tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not {{designate}} a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.|$|E
25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan {{to believe that there}} must have been a common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis for the existence of a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, due to a lack of common order or sequence. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for their own needs, including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely {{that the need for}} a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
