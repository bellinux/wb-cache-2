40|$|The {{interbank market}} is {{important}} for the efficient functioning of the financial system, transmission of monetary policy and therefore ultimately the real economy. In particular, it facilitates banks' liquidity management. This paper aims at extending the literature which views interbank markets as mutual liquidity insurance mechanism by taking into account persistence of liquidity shocks. Following a theory of long-term <b>interbank</b> <b>funding</b> a financial system which is modeled as a micro-founded agent based complex network interacting with a real economic sector is developed. The model features <b>interbank</b> <b>funding</b> as an over-the-counter phenomenon and realistically replicates financial system phenomena of network formation, monetary policy transmission and endogenous money creation. The framework is used to carry out an optimal policy analysis in which the policymaker maximizes real activity via choosing the optimal interest rate in a trade-off between loan supply and financial fragility. It is shown that the interbank market renders the financial system more efficient relative to a setting without mutual insurance against persistent liquidity shocks and therefore plays a crucial role for welfare...|$|R
40|$|This PhD Thesis is {{composed}} of three chapters, each discussing {{a specific type of}} risk that banks face. The first chapter talks about Systemic Risk and how banks get exposed to it through the <b>Interbank</b> <b>Funding</b> Market. Exposures in the said market have Systemic Risk implications because the market creates linkages, where the failure of one party can affect the others in the market. By showing that CDS Spreads, as bank risk indicators, are positively related to their Net <b>Interbank</b> <b>Funding</b> Market Exposures, this chapter establishes the above Systemic Risk Implications of <b>Interbank</b> <b>Funding.</b> Meanwhile, the second chapter discusses how banks may handle Illiquidity Risk, defined as the possibility of having sudden funding needs. Illiquidity Risk is embodied in this chapter through Loan Commitments as they oblige banks to lend to its clients, up to a certain amount of funds at any time. This chapter points out that using Securitization as funding facility, could allow the banks to manage this Illiquidity Risk. To make this case, this chapter demonstrates empirically that banks having an increase in Loan Commitments, may experience an increase in risk profile but such can be offset by an accompanying increase in Securitization Activity. Lastly, the third chapter focuses on how banks manage Credit Risk also through Securitization. Securitization has a Credit Risk management property by allowing the offloading of risk. This chapter investigates how banks use such property by looking at the effect of securitization on the banks’ loan portfolios and overall risk and returns. The findings are that securitization is positively related to loan portfolio size and the portfolio share of risky loans, which translates to higher risk and returns. Thus, this chapter points out that Credit Risk management through Securitization may be have been done towards higher risk taking for high returns. ...|$|R

40|$|I propose {{creation}} of a venture bank, able to multiply the capital of a venture capital firm by up to 47 times, without requiring access to the Federal Reserve or other central bank apart from settlement. This concept rests on insuring loans to expand Tier 1 and 2 capital. Profitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of default insurance notes, cost of default insurance, and the multiple of original capital (MOC) adopted by the venture bank. If the form that uses <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> is used, then it also depends on the <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> rates. I propose a new derivative financial instrument, the Default Insurance Note (DIN), to insure loans to venture investments. A DIN {{is similar to a}} credit default swap (CDS) but with a host of unique features. The features and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along with audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry exchanges with special rules to ensure orderly operation of the market. It is the {{creation of}} public markets for DINs that makes possible the use of public market pricing to indirectly establish a market capitalization for the underlying venture-bank investment, which is the key to achieving regulatory acceptance of the fully-insured version of this proposal. That fully-insured version insulates the venture-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite dramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 10 are attainable. I show that both where the DIN is a minor fraction of investment, and where the DIN insures 100 % of invested funds for the duration, in the normal range of returns the DIN underwriting business is profitable.

40|$|Interconnections among {{financial}} institutions create potential channels for contagion and amplification of shocks {{to the financial}} system. We estimate {{the extent to which}} interconnections increase expected losses, with minimal information about network topology, under a wide range of shock distributions. Expected losses from network effects are small without substantial heterogeneity in bank sizes and a high degree of reliance on <b>interbank</b> <b>funding.</b> They are also small unless shocks are magnified by some mechanism beyond simple spillover effects; these include bankruptcy costs, fire sales, and mark-to-market revaluations of assets.

The hypothesis tested postulates that the annual inflation targets could have produced some seasonality in the operation of the overnight <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> mar-ket in which the government funding rate is determined. To test this hypothesis a series of Taylor rules are estimated using linear and non-linear methods. The results show that the inflation targets established for the end of year have special importance in the determination of the interest rate during the middle months of each year, and in the last quarter the focus of attention shifts to the target corresponding to December of the next year. Also, the results suggest that during the disinflation period, the short term interest rate has shown less inertia and more intense reactions to inflationary pressures during the central months of each year...|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} {{allocation}} of central bank liquidity among the participants of the interbank market by using network analysis’ metrics. Our analytical framework considers that a super-spreader simultaneously excels at receiving (borrowing) and distributing (lending) central bank’s liquidity for the whole network, as measured by financial institutions’ hub centrality and authority centrality, respectively. Evidence suggests that the Colombian <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> market exhibits an inhomogeneous and hierarchical network structure, akin to a core-periphery organization, in which a few financial institutions fulfill the role of central bank’s liquidity super-spreaders. Our results concur with evidence from other interbank markets and other financial networks regarding the flaws of traditional direct financial contagion models based on homogeneous and non-hierarchical networks. Also, concurrent with literature on lending relationships in interbank markets, we confirm that the probability of being a super-spreader is mainly determined by financial institutions’ size.

40|$|The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is Canada's main {{electronic}} <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> {{transfer system}} that financial institutions use daily to transmit thousands of payments worth several billions of dollars. The LVTS {{is different than}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems because, while each payment is final and irrevocable, settlement occurs on a multilateral net basis {{at the end of}} the day. Furthermore, LVTS payments are secured by a collateral pool that mutualizes losses across participants in the event of a default. In this paper, we use the Bank of Finland Simulator to examine the implications of fully collateralizing LVTS payments, similar to an RTGS. An important caveat to consider, however, is that the simulations do not take into account the anticipated change in payment behaviour in response to a change in collateral requirements. In this regard, we include a queuing mechanism to at least reflect more efficient use of liquidity. The results indicate that collateral requirements vary by participant and some participants actually require less collateral in the simulation than what is required under the current LVTS design...|$|E

As these networks are used by banks to settle accounts with each other, rapid or overnight wire transfer of {{large amounts of money}} are commonplace; while banks have put checks and balances in place, there is the risk that insiders may attempt to use fraudulent or forged documents which claim to request a bank depositor's money be wired to another bank, often an offshore account in some distant foreign country.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of the financial turmoil {{of the past year}} has been the credit crunch. For borrowing of many kinds, terms are tougher and interest rates are higher, reflecting skyrocketing risk premiums. Of particular importance are the elevated risk premiums on interbank loans—loans that banks make to each other. The higher rates at which banks fund themselves can raise the interest rates borne not just by bank borrowers, but also by nonbank borrowers whose loan rates are tied to some of these <b>interbank</b> <b>funding</b> costs. One consequence of these higher rates is that they partially offset the effects of the monetary easing that the Federal Reserve has implemented since the fall of 2007...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{systemic}} risk in multilateral netting payments systems. A four-period model is constructed {{to investigate the}} effects of random liquidity shocks. There are three different types of agents in this model: banks, the payments system operator, and the central bank. Banks pay one another via the payments system. The payments system operator sets the rules for participation. These include total asset requirements, collateral requirements and net debit caps. The central bank serves {{as a source of}} liquidity during a financial crisis. The model is constructed along the lines of Diamond and Dybvig (1983). In period 0, banks optimize their holdings of noninterest-earning central bank reserves to meet their payment obligations and any additional liquidity obligation. Their alternative is to invest in a nonliquid asset that earns a rate of return R. In period 1, a number of banks are unable to make their payments. The number of banks defaulting is random and realized after banks decide their optimal reserve holdings. In period 2, the remaining banks must cover the net payments of defaulting banks minus the defaulting banks' collateral holdings. Each remaining bank has three options to meet its liquidity event: deliver reserves it holds {{at the time of the}} shock, borrow funds in the interbank market from banks in net credit positions, or default since it cannot meet its additional obligations. In period 3, final wealth of each due to bank is calculated. All banks want to maximize final wealth in period 3.; The model provides the following results. The model calculates the threshold point where the payments system collapses. An <b>interbank</b> <b>funds</b> market increases the efficiency of the payments system. Implementation of policy options such as total asset requirements, collateral requirements, and net debit caps decrease {{systemic risk}}.

40|$|During {{the first}} half of 2008, the Central Bank of Uruguay {{introduced}} changes in the regulation of reserve and liquidity requirements, increasing the requirements for short-term funding and funding from non-residents as well as introducing a requirement for <b>interbank</b> <b>funding.</b> The combination of these reforms with data that follows all loans granted to non-financial firms in Uruguay, allows me to identify their impact on the supply of credit. Following a difference-in-difference approach, I compare lending before and after the introduction of the policy changes among banks with different degrees of exposition to the funds targeted by the policies.

As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. With respect to what went wrong, it is important to recognise that the financial crisis occurred for a host of reasons and, thus, there is no single silver bullet to avoid such crises in the future. At the heart of the crisis was a tremendous build-up in leverage, which our regulatory framework failed to prevent.
