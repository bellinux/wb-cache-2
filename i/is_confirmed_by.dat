5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> Alec Clifton-Taylor, {{who notes that}} the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> {{a map of}} the island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|The monophyly of Malacostraca {{is widely}} accepted.

These include differences in mutation rates in different lineages, different patterns of evolution being apparent in different sources of data, including convergent evolution, and long branch attraction.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} doubt that early Christianity {{influenced}} Mingulay (for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross-inscribed slabs) but no direct evidence has yet been found. From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement, their presence on the island <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> the many features they named.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E
5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E

5|$|Manetho's Epitome {{states that}} Amenhotep I ruled Egypt {{for twenty years}} and seven months or twenty-one years, {{depending}} on the source. While Amenhotep I's highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10, Manetho's statement <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> a passage in the tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet. This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 Years. Thus, in the high chronology, Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and, in the low chronology, from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC, though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years.|$|E

However, Green throws a can of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself alight outside.|$|E
5|$|These Northmen {{may have}} been some of those who were driven out of Dublin in 902, but could also have been the same group who had {{defeated}} Domnall in 900. The Chronicle states that the Northmen were killed in Srath Erenn, which <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> the Annals of Ulster which records the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar and many others {{at the hands of the}} men of Fortriu in 904. This Ímar was the first of the Uí Ímair, that is the grandsons of Ímar, to be reported; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín's reign. The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint Columba following fasting and prayer. An entry in the Chronicon Scotorum under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.|$|E

5|$|When visiting Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, China, Marco Polo {{noted that}} Christian churches {{had been built}} there.

Nestorian Christianity had existed in China earlier during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) when a Persian monk named Alopen (Chinese: Āluósī; 阿羅本; 阿羅斯) came to the capital Chang'an in 653 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang'an (modern Xi'an) dated to the year 781.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{time in the}} Isles <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> several Icelandic sources which recount how, in 1202, Guðmundr Arason {{attempted}} to sail from Iceland to Norway to become consecrated as the Bishop of Hólar. These saga accounts relate how the Icelanders encountered a severe storm and were blown far off course before being forced to make landfall in the Hebrides. The island they landed upon was almost certainly Sanday, a tiny tidal island linked to its larger neighbour Canna, the westernmost of the Small Isles. According to the saga the Icelanders were pressured numerous times to pay a landing-tax to a king named Óláfr. The king encountered by the Icelanders is considered to have been Óláfr, although {{at this point in}} history the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles is not known to have encompassed the Small Isles. One possibility is that Óláfr, like the Icelanders, may have been temporarily stranded on the tidal island, and that he may have taken advantage of the storm-stricken churchmen to offset the poverty that is assigned to him by the chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Both Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished {{during the}} Badami Chalukya period, though {{it seems the}} former was more popular. Famous temples were built {{in places such as}} Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (archakas) were invited from {{northern}} India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (vrata) and the giving of gifts (dana) was important. The Badami kings were initially followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and Sapta Matrikas ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha ("horse sacrifice"). The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of PulakeshinII was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and Ardhanarishwara (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>by</b> the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning.|$|E
