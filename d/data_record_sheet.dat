40|$|A new {{case study}} method of {{assessment}} was developed to challenge advanced undergraduate biology majors interested in medical careers and allied health professions. This method is an alternative to traditional "unknown" identifications used in many microbiology laboratories. Students used various biochemical tests and selective media throughout the course to identify organisms cultured from their own bodies. In preparing a final assessment for the course, an assignment was developed to challenge the students to apply what they had learned in a medically relevant setting. Also of importance was the elimination of further biochemical testing by these students and prevention of contact with strict pathogens in this lab, due to budget and safety constraints, respectively. Each student was provided with a clinical specimen <b>data</b> <b>record</b> <b>sheet</b> and additional information about their "diseased patient". Students used analytical skills and critical thinking, as well as knowledge gained throughout the semester, to logically deduce the causative agent of disease in the mock patients. Students were required to: (i) describe the steps in this logical deduction, (ii) provide {{a brief overview of}} the characteristics and virulence factors of the organism(s), (iii) investigate all disease(s) caused by the organism, (iv) describe symptomology of the patient in detail, and (v) investigate disease treatment and prevention methods. The final assignment involved library and Internet research and culminated in a written report, which further developed writing and communication skills. Detailed descriptions of and materials for this assignment are provided along with an overall evaluation of this method after implementation...|$|E
40|$|In Greece, every year, about 35. 000 people {{admitted}} to hospitals due to traumatic brain injuries and about 1. 600 of them dies. The main cause is traffic accidents. They can cause death to young people, especially 19 to 25 years. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of traumatic brain injuries in the Emergency Department of the General Hospital of Sparta. Material and Methods: This study was carried out by collecting data from the hospital records and the patients log books at the Emergency Department of Sparta General Hospital. A specially designed <b>data</b> <b>record</b> <b>sheet</b> was employed, which included patient demographic data, hospital access method, clinical condition, injury classification and severity, possible co-existing trauma, diagnostic tests, treatment, clinical outcome as well as data relating to the trauma mechanism and causes. Statistical evaluation took place in the form of parametric tests with IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Results: A total of 1785 head trauma injury adults patients, that were referred to the Emergency Department from 2005 to 2010 were included. Exploring the association of cranium-cerebral causes with demographic factors, as far as the adults are concerned the following emerged: The causes of CCT are influenced by gender (p< 0. 001), nationality (p< 0. 001) and place of residence (p< 0. 001). The main cause of CCT for men was car accidents while for women it was falls. The main cause of CCT among Greeks is falls while among foreigners it is physical abuse. In all the municipalities of Laconia the main cause of CCT was car accidents, apart from the residents of Evrotas and Sparta for whom the main cause was falls. The main outcome for the adults was associated with the admission to hospital (p< 0. 001) and with the cause of CCT (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: The study highlighted the extent of this social issue at local level and the enormous problem of recording traumatic brain injury. Deficiencies identified in missing information and diversity in ways of keeping data...|$|E

40|$|Background: Abortion is an {{important}} social and public health issue. In Bangladesh complication from unsafe abortion {{is one of the}} leading causes of maternal mortality. It is a serious health problem. World Health Organisation estimates that 14 % of maternal deaths which occur every year in the countries of South Asia including Bangladesh are due to abortion. Study shows manual vacuum aspiration procedure is safe and effective in incomplete abortion. Very few clinical trials were carried out in Bangladesh to assess the safety and effectivity of manual vacuum aspiration in managing incomplete abortion. Objective: To find out the outcome of manual vacuum aspiration in the management of patients of incomplete abortion. Materials and Methods: This observational descriptive study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Dhaka Medical College & Hospital from June to December, 2004. One hundred cases of diagnosed incomplete abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation were managed by manual vacuum aspiration during this period. A <b>data</b> <b>recording</b> <b>sheet</b> was designed for this purpose. Haemodynamically stable patients with no history of induced abortion and fever were enrolled. Results: Procedure time of manual vacuum aspiration was short, average duration was 7 minutes. Bleeding was minimum (20 - 30 mL) in 67 % cases and weighted mean was 29. 80 mL. Eighty three percent patients were stable during the procedure and only 3 % needed blood transfusion. Nonnarcotic analgesics were used in 59 % cases and 33 % needed only proper counselling. Average duration of hospital stay was 2 hours. Effectiveness of the procedure was about 98 % with very low post procedure complication rate (2 %). Conclusion: MVA procedure is a safe and effective technique of uterine evacuation in incomplete abortion. It is quick, less expensive, effective and less painful. Hospital stay and chance of perforation of uterus is less. So this procedure should be considered by health care system in Bangladesh for improving treatment of incomplete abortion to reduce both maternal morbidity and mortality...|$|R

Their activities must be guided by research to produce measurable results contributed in reducing casualties and making roads safer. This paper provides detailed information about {{the second stage of}} the study for an evaluation of social legislation infringements for international haulage truck drivers involved in severe road transport accidents. The data were obtained from original sources of information: from digital tachograph printouts, analog tachograph <b>data</b> <b>record</b> <b>sheets</b> and attestations of activities. The aim of the second research stage was to find out to which extent the drivers involved in severe road traffic accidents (hereinafter RTA) have committed infringements more often and in larger quantities compared to the data obtained from the vehicle and driver regular roadside checks, i. e. compared with the drivers not involved in RTA. The second task for the paper is to analyze infringements by type and by level of drivers' riskiness {{to be involved in the}} RTA. The obtained findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies have been compiled, processed, analyzed and systematized by severity, quantity and type of simultaneously committed offences, installed tachograph type and other parameters. The statistical data have been grouped, systematized and analyzed according to the aim of the research. Based on various sources of information, an analysis of infringements for international haulage truck drivers was made between the obtained average amount of infringements per severe RTA case and per regular roadside check. The results of the research state that the drivers involved in severe RTA have committed considerably more infringements before the actual RTA has happened. The most part of infringements directly or indirectly refers to the lack of rest time and increased driving or overall working hours. These infringements for international haulage truck drivers are referred to be as major factors contributing to drivers' fatigue and high accidents risk...|$|R
