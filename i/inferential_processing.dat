40|$|Given {{the recent}} {{abundance}} of brand choice data from scanner panels market researchers have neglected the measurement {{and analysis of}} perceptions. Heterogeneity of perceptions is still a largely unexplored issue in market structure and segmentation studies. Over the last decade various parametric approaches toward modelling segmented perception-preference structures such as combined MDS and Latent Class procedures have been introduced. These methods, however, are not taylored for qualitative data describing consumers' redundant and fuzzy perceptions of brand images. A completely different method is based on topology-sensitive vector quantization (VQ) for consumers-by-brands-by-attributes data. It maps the segment-specific perceptual structures into bubble-pie-bar charts with multiple brand positions demonstrating perceptual distinctiveness or similarity. Though the analysis proceeds without any distributional assumptions it allows for significance testing.

40|$|This paper assesses several broad {{approaches}} to language analysis {{with respect to}} the problem of lexical ambiguity. The impact of the problem on both syntactic and semantic analysis is discussed, and several common methods for disambiguation, including the use of selectional restrictions and scriptal lexicons, are analyzed. Their shortcomings illustrate the need for complex inference to resolve ambiguity, which forms one of the key functional arguments in favor of integrating language analysis with memory and inference. However, it has proven surprisingly difficult to realize such an integrated approach in practice: An assessment of lexical disambiguation within some recent models which attempt to do so reveals that they rely largely on the traditional techniques of selectional restrictions and scriptal lexicons, with all their drawbacks. The difficulty is shown to stem primarily from the theories of memory and <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> utilized.

The results showed that there is a positive correlation between the learners’ organization of L 2 mental lexicon and their performance on English homonym <b>processing.</b> <b>Inferential</b> statistic analysis indicates that learners whose L 2 mental lexicon is more syntagmatically related can process the English homonym more effectively. They can use contextual cues (semantic and syntactic information) to deactivate inappropriate meanings while low proficiency learners may be slower and less effective in using the sentence context cues needed for disambiguation. Therefore, it has been tentatively indicated that effective spreading activation of a word during reading and listening is important and helpful for learners’ comprehension, and pedagogically suggested that consciously categorizing syntagmatically related words in L 2 mental lexicon during teaching and learning new English words can help reconstruct lexical networks so as to correctly and quickly retrieve the words from the mental lexicon in a certain context and better understand the meaning of the whole context in reading and listening...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the question of}} whether inferences required for textual comprehension are drawn at encoding, for both children and adults. Third-, fifth-, and eighth-grade students, and adults read a series of four-sentence stories where a consequence was strongly implied. The sentence implying this consequence was either presented in the last sentence of the story (a forward inference), was followed by a comprehension-inducing sentence (a bridging inference), or was followed by a sentence which explicitly mentioned the consequence (a bridging-explicit inference). In addition, one-half of the subjects engaged in an integrative reading task, while the other half engaged in more superficial processing. Whether or not the consequence inferences were drawn at encoding was assessed through the use of reading times to the final sentences in the bridging and bridging-explicit versions. In addition, question-answering latencies and error percentages to questions probing the inference were also obtained. The results supported the main hypothesis that the bridging inferences would be generated during reading (encoding) while the forward inferences would not be generated until test time (retrieval). Although reading times and question-answering latencies decreased with each higher grade level, the pattern of results was identical for all four age groups. This suggests that children as young as the third grade have adult-like <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities. The reading goal manipulation was ineffective in prompting additional <b>inferential</b> <b>processing,</b> for all four age levels. The only interpretable effect of reading condition was that more developmental improvement was noted in the integrative reading condition than in the superficial reading condition. Post-hoc analyses suggested that the younger readers were somehow preparing themselves in advance to perform the integrative reading task, and this advance preparation taxed their available attentional resources. It was argued that further research needs to focus on finding a reading goal manipulation that is successful in altering young children 2 ̆ 7 s reading comprehension. ...|$|E

40|$|Reading comprehension, the {{construction}} of meaning from text is generally {{considered one of the}} most central cognitive skills children acquire during their school career. (Carreiras & Clifton, 2004; Mason, 2004; Ritchey, 2011; van den Broek, 2010). The research reported was designed to investigate the critical role played by certain factors implicated in the mental representation of text and to establish how their role varies as a function of developmental age. It would thus seem that <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> is powerfully influenced both by metacognitive and structural factors which can play a role during text comprehension. This research has focused in particular on two specific aspects of metacognitive control: 1) the ability to identify and focus attention on the central points in a text; and 2) the capacity to evaluate the coherence of the text and detect incongruence. Specifically, it was decided to analyse in a sample of 180 subjects selected from three different age groups (7, 10 and 18 years of age respectively), the role of those factors in mediating and influencing the generation of the inferences needed to understand a text characterised by a sequence of information which flows in a logical order but leads to a conclusion which is contrary to the expectations evoked by the text. In line with this aim, it was decided to take into account factors related to encoding (added information about the key object – a title), those involved in recovery (inferential tests regarding the object and action of change), as well as purely metacognitive factors, such as evaluation of one’s own comprehension and awareness of textual incongruence, whose presence, according to our assumptions, should facilitate the formulation of inferential hypotheses. The results tend to confirm the hypothesis that this is in fact a significant developmental trend in the role played by those factors involved in the coherent text representation and in the <b>inferential</b> <b>processing.</b> These findings suggest that comprehension involves not only cognitive processes related to the elaboration of information, but also metacognitive factors to do with awareness and control of such elaboration...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{contrasting}} theories, or {{variants of}} them, are predominant {{in the current}} debate on visual cognition.

30|$|Another {{contributing}} factor {{seems to be}} individual differences in working memory, the neurocognitive system for temporary retention and processing, limited in capacity (Baddeley, 2010). With printed materials, individual differences in working memory {{have been associated with}} differences in text comprehension (Daneman & Merikle, 1996), because working memory constrains <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> and model construction (Barreyro, Cevasco, Burin, & Molinari, 2012). In hypertext comprehension, more demanding interfaces affect particularly low working memory participants (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Gwizdka, 2009; Lee & Tedder, 2003; Naumann, Richter, Christmann, & Groeben, 2008). For example, Naumann et al. (2008) taught students strategies for learning with hypertexts, and found different outcomes for high and low working memory participants. Whereas high working memory students benefitted from training, low capacity ones were negatively impacted both in comprehension and navigation, as shown by the number of visits to task relevant content pages. This suggested that learning a new strategy loaded working memory beyond comprehension and navigation requirements, and this increased load was difficult to handle for low working memory students.|$|E

I argue that the elaborated metaphorical utterances found in psychotherapy transcripts are processed in a manner altogether distinct from that outlined by the ad hoc concept account of metaphor, proposed within Relevance Theory (which I take to be applicable only to the comprehension of more accessible lexical and phrasal metaphors).

While for verbal stimuli the increasing strength of subjective evaluation was correlated with increased neural activation of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC), a similar effect was observed for nonverbal stimuli in the amygdala.

40|$|This paper reports two {{experiments}} that investigate skilled and less-skilled compre-henders' {{ability to understand}} pronouns. In the first experiment, the less-skilled group made more errors in answering questions about pronoun antecedents than did the skilled group, even {{when there was a}} gender cue to the correct referent, and when the clause containing the referents was available for them to refer back to. In the second experiment, the pronoun antecedents always differed in gender, and the children's attention was drawn to the pronominal link by requiring them to provide a pronoun appropriate to the sentence, before they answered a question about it. The difficulty of the pronoun resolution was manipulated by varying the inferential complexity of the pronoun-anaphor link. In both tasks, the difference between the groups was larger when a complex inference was required than when only a simple inference was needed. We conclude that the less-skilled comprehenders' difficulty in resolving pronouns may arise in part because they do not attend properly to cues such as gender of referent, and in particular because they have difficulty drawing necessary inferences, especially when the <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> is at all complex.

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} {{paradigm}} shift {{in the investigation of}} the self. Synthesizing neuroimaging results from studies investigating the self, the authors first demonstrate that self-relatedness evaluation involves a wide cerebral network, labeled E-network, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporoparietal junction, and temporal poles. They further show that this E-network is also recruited during resting state, others ’ mind reading, memory recall, and reasoning. According to these data, (a) the profile of activation of the E-network demonstrates no preference for the self, and (b) the authors suggest that activity in this network {{can be explained by the}} involvement of cognitive processes common to all the tasks recruiting it: <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> and memory recall. On this basis, they conclude that standard ways to tackle the self by considering self-evaluation do not target the self in its specificity. Instead, they argue that self-specificity characterizes the subjective perspective, which is not intrinsically self-evaluative but rather relates any represented object to the representing subject. They further propose that such self-specific subject–object relation is anchored to the sensorimotor integration of efference with reafference (i. e., the motor command of the subject’s action and its sensory consequence in the external world) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe neuropsychological {{features}} of the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) syndromes continue to be defined. Here we describe a detailed neuropsychological case study of a patient with a mutation in the progranulin (GRN) gene who presented with progressive word-finding difficulty. Key neuropsychological features in this case included gravely impoverished propositional speech with anomia and prolonged word-finding pauses, impaired speech repetition most marked for sentences, and severely impaired verbal (with preserved spatial) short-term memory. There was a dissociated profile of performance on semantic processing tasks: visual semantic processing was intact, while within the verbal domain, verb comprehension was impaired and processing of nouns was intact on tasks requiring direct semantic processing but impaired on tasks requiring associative or <b>inferential</b> <b>processing.</b> Brain MRI showed asymmetric left cerebral atrophy particularly affecting the temporo-parietal junction, supero-lateral temporal and inferior frontal lobes. This case most closely resembles the PPA syndrome known as the logopenic/phonological aphasia variant (LPA) however there were also deficits of grammar and speech repetition suggesting an overlap with the progressive non-fluent aphasia (agrammatic) variant (PNFA). Certain prominent {{features of}} this case (in particular, the profile of semantic impairment) have not been emphasised in previous descriptions of LPA or PNFA, suggesting that GRN may cause an overlapping PPA syndrome but with a distinctive cognitive profile. This neuropsychological evidence suggests that GRN-PPA may result from damage involving the temporo-parietal junction and its functional connections in both the dorsal and ventral language networks, with implications for our understanding of language network pathophysiology...|$|E

Specifically, it was decided to analyse, in a sample of 180 subjects was selected from three different age groups (7, 10 and 18 years of age respectively), the role of such factors in mediating and influencing the generation of the inferences needed to understand a piece of text characterised by a sequence of information which flows in a logical order, but leads to a conclusion which is contrary to the expectations evoked by the text. In line with this objective, it was decided to take into account factors related to encoding (added information about the key object – a title), those involved in recall (inferential tests regarding the object and action of change), as well as purely metacognitive factors, such as evaluation of one’s own comprehension and awareness of textual incongruence, whose presence, according to our assumptions, should facilitate the formulation of inferential hypotheses. It would thus seem that <b>inferential</b> <b>processing</b> is powerfully influenced both by cognitive and structural factors, factors which can play a role during both encoding and recall. The results reported here tend to confirm the hypothesis that there is indeed a significant developmental trend in the role played by those factors involved in the coherent representation of text and in the formulation of inferences. The data suggest that children in the youngest age group obtain the greatest advantage from clues in reaching a more correct representation of the text concerned. It is concluded that inferential processes do not serve only to make connections between propositions, but to construct a coherent mental representation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{attainment}} {{gap between}} monolingual, English-speaking children and children learning EAL {{is a continuing}} cause for concern (NALDIC, 2004). Investigations into EAL learners' literacy skills have identified comprehension as a key area of difficulty for this group (e. g. Hutchinson, Whiteley, Smith & Connors, 2003). For monolingual children, difficulties with comprehension impact on learning and attainment across the curriculum (Cain & Oakhill, 2006). Increasing {{our understanding of the}} comprehension difficulties faced by children learning PAL may, therefore, contribute to an understanding of their continuing underachievement. This report begins with a review of the research pertinent to the development of comprehension and related skills with particular relevance to children learning EAL. This is followed by details of a series of experimental studies designed to investigate and extend current knowledge in relation to the comprehension skills of children learning EAL and their monolingual peers. Children in school Years 3 and 4 completed a range of measures which reflect the knowledge sources and component processes that are critical to comprehension, for example vocabulary knowledge and <b>inferential</b> <b>processing.</b> In addition, longitudinal analysis examined the developmental progression of comprehension-related skills between Year 3 and Year 4. Findings demonstrate that the comprehension difficulties of children learning EAL are largely restricted to problems understanding written text. Difficulties with reading comprehension are not attributable to limited decoding skills; rather, lower levels of lexical knowledge and a focus on decoding during reading place significant constraints on comprehension and limit the efficacy of higher-order strategic processing for this group of learners. Findings further illustrate that, without support, the comprehension difficulties of children learning PAL persist over time and are likely to make a significant contribution to the relative underachievement of this group of children. The results are discussed in terms of their theoretical importance and practical implications for supporting the development of comprehension skills in young PAL learners...|$|E
