40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by the author that some aspects of severely distorted flow into multistage compressors may be examined utilizing an integral technique. The general idea of the proposed technique is clear enough; the appropriate equations of motion and energy are integrated peripherally and radially, using reasonable assumptions for the distributions of velocity and thermodynamic properties, and thereby reduced to ordinary non-linear differential equations for the parameters that describe the distributions. The questions that arise are whether the cascade characteristics may be described appropriately over wide variations of inlet angle, including stall, and whether the profiles may be characterized by a sufficiently small number of parameters to make the technique attractive. The present paper examines a specific example of distorted inlet flow through the two-dimensional annulus of a multistage compressor which can be solved completely. It is shown that the essential features of this exact solution, including stall, may be described by a two-parameter <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles</b> and that an integral technique, utilizing these elementary profiles, will yield essentially the same results.

This paper examines the evolution of a two-dimensional vortex which initially consists of an axisymmetric monopole vortex with a perturbation of azimuthal wavenumber m = 2 added to it. If the perturbation is weak, then the vortex returns to an axisymmetric state and the non-zero Fourier harmonics generated by the perturbation decay to zero. However, if a finite perturbation threshold is exceeded, then a persistent nonlinear vortex structure is formed. This structure consists of a coherent vortex core with two satellites rotating around it. The paper considers the formation of these satellites by taking an asymptotic limit in which a compact vortex is surrounded by a weak skirt of vorticity. The resulting equations match the behaviour of a normal mode riding on the vortex with the evolution of fine-scale vorticity in a critical layer inside the skirt. Three estimates of inviscid thresholds for the formation of satellites are computed and compared: two estimates use qualitative diagnostics, the appearance of an inflection point or neutral mode in the mean profile. The other is determined quantitatively by solving the normal mode/critical-layer equations numerically.

40|$|Shear flow instabilities can profoundly {{affect the}} {{diffusion}} of momentum in jets, stars, and disks. The Richardson criterion gives a sufficient condition for instability of a shear flow in a stratified medium. The velocity gradient $V'$ can only destabilize a stably stratified medium with squared Brunt-Vaisala frequency $N^ 2 $ if $V'^ 2 / 4 >N^ 2 $. We find {{this is no longer}} true when the medium is a magnetized plasma. We investigate the effect of stable stratification on magnetic field and velocity profiles unstable to magneto-shear instabilities, i. e., instabilities which require the presence of both magnetic field and shear flow. We show that a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles</b> originally studied by Tatsuno & Dorland (2006) remain unstable even when $V'^ 2 / 4 <N^ 2 $, violating the Richardson criterion. However, not all magnetic fields can result in a violation of the Richardson criterion. We consider a class of flows originally considered by Kent (1968), which are destabilized by a constant magnetic field, and show that they become stable when $V'^ 2 / 4 <N^ 2 $, as predicted by the Richardson criterion. This suggests that magnetic free energy is required to violate the Richardson criterion. This work implies that the Richardson criterion cannot be used when evaluating the ideal stability of a sheared, stably stratified, and magnetized plasma. We briefly discuss the implications for astrophysical systems. Comment: Accepted to ApJ, 48 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Consequently, we consider monitoring profiles via two methods, a nonparametric (NP) method and a semiparametric procedure that combines both parametric and NP profile fits.

Also, we incorporate a mixed model approach to both the parametric and NP model fits {{to account for the}} autocorrelation within profiles and to deal with the collection of profiles as a random sample from a common population.

40|$|Homogeneous {{condensation}} of vapours {{mixed with}} a carrier gas in the stagnation point boundary layer flow near a cold wall is considered. There is a condensation region near the wall with supersaturated vapour. Assuming that the surface tension times the molecular area is {{much larger than the}} thermal energy far from the wall, droplets are nucleated exclusively in a narrow nucleation layer where the Zeldovich flux of clusters surpassing the critical nucleus size is at a maximum. The vapour condenses in the free molecular regime on the droplets, which are thermophoretically attracted to the wall. Unlike the narrow condensation region for heterogeneous condensation on solid particles, in the case of homogeneous condensation the condensation region is wide even when the rate of vapour scavenging by droplets is large. A singular perturbation theory of homogeneous vapour condensation in boundary layer flow approximates very well the vapour and droplet density profiles, the nucleation layer and the deposition rates at the wall for wide ranges of the wall temperature and the scavenging parameter B. A key point in the theory is to select a trial vapour number density profile among a one parameter <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles</b> between an upper and a lower bound. The maximum of the Zeldovich flux for supercritical nuclei provides the approximate location of the nucleation layer and an approximate droplet density profile. Then the condensate number of molecules and the vapour density profile are calculated by matched asymptotic expansions that also yield the deposition rates. For sufficiently large wall temperatures, a more precise corrected asymptotic theory is given.

40|$|The viscous {{evolution}} of two corotating vortices is analysed using direct two-dimensional numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. The {{article focuses on}} vortex interaction regimes before merging. Two parameters are varied: a steepness parameter n which measures the steepness of the initial vorticity profiles in a given <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles,</b> and the Reynolds number Re (between 500 and 16, 000). Two distinct relaxation processes are identified. The first one is non-viscous and corresponds to a rapid adaptation of each vortex to the external (strain) field generated by the other vortex. This adaptation process, which is profile dependent, is described and explained using the damped Kelvin modes of each vortex. The second relaxation process is a slow diffusion phenomenon. It {{is similar to the}} relaxation of any non-Gaussian axisymmetrical vortex towards the Gaussian. The quasi-stationary solutions evolves on a viscous-time scale toward a single attractive solution which corresponds to the evolution from two initially-Gaussian vortices. The attractive solution is analysed in detail up to the merging threshold a/b ≈ 0. 22 where a and b are the vortex radius and the separation distance respectively. The vortex core deformations are quantified and compared to those induced by a single vortex in a rotating strain field. A good agreement with the asymptotic predictions is demonstrated concerning the eccentricity of vortex core streamlines. A weak anomalous Reynolds number dependence of the solution is also identified. This dependence is attributed to the advection-diffusion of vorticity towards the hyperbolic points of the system and across the separatrix connecting these points. A Re^ 1 / 3 scaling for the vorticity at the central hyperbolic point is obtained. These findings are discussed {{in the context of a}} vortex merging criterion...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and Sanford Klein; 215 pp. The performance of photovoltaic powered pumps in direct and indirect solar domestic hot water (PV-SDHW) systems has been studied. The direct PV-SDHW system employs a photovoltaic array, a DC-motor, a centrifugal pump, a thermal collector, and a storage tank. The indirect PV-SDHW system employs similar components {{to those in the}} direct PV-SDHW system in addition to a heat exchanger to transfer the energy from the collector-loop fluid to the tank-loop fluid. Both a forced convection heat exchanger and a natural convection heat exchanger were investigated. The primary objective of this thesis is to optimize the design and quantify the performance of PV- SDHW systems. The search methodology for an optimum PV-SDHW system has been performed in a unique two-phase procedure. In phase one the goal is to find, among the possible PV pumping systems' flow rate profiles, the profile that maximizes the performance of a given SDHW system. In phase two the goal is to select the components of the PV pumping system. Each combination of PV cells, DC-motor and pump exhibits a unique flow rate profile. Therefore, the problem in this phase is to identify the PV pumping system components that results in the best match to the optimum flow rate profile found in phase one. This decoupling considerably eased the process of optimal search. An analysis of actual flow rate profiles of PV pumping systems showed that the optimum search can be restricted to the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>profiles</b> represented by a function dependent upon three parameters only. A comparison is made between the performance of the optimum direct PV-SDHW system and a conventional direct SDHW system operating under three control schemes: an ON-OFF flow SDHW system operating at the manufacturer's recommended constant flow rate, an ON-OFF flow SDHW system operating at the optimum constant flow rate and a linear proportional flow SDHW system, with the flow proportional to the solar radiation operating under an optimum proportionality.
