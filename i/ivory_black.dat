He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, <b>ivory</b> <b>black,</b> cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E
25|$|Lowry {{claimed to}} have only ever used five colours: Flake White (Lead White), <b>Ivory</b> <b>Black,</b> Vermillion Red, Prussian Blue and Yellow Ochre, all from the art-supply firm Winsor & Newton, but expert {{analysis}} of the paint used in Darby and Joan showed that it contained traces of Zinc White. However, the programme revealed a photograph of Lowry's studio in the 1950s which showed that he did have both Titanium White and Zinc White. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film about the artist, which included shots of his studio. All three works were judged to be genuine {{by a panel of}} experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of £200,000.|$|E

6000|$|Next day I {{set about}} my business. I {{had a special}} letter of {{introduction}} to Lorenzo, and was ushered in to him by a clerk. I found {{two people in the}} room; one, {{a young man with a}} long, oval face, and the bones of the face and chin very strongly marked; he had a very wonderful skin, like brown <b>ivory,</b> <b>black</b> hair that fell over his forehead and ears, and, most striking of all, large brown eyes, very soft and melancholy. I thought I had never before seen a man quite so beautiful. Seated by him, talking with animation, was an insignificant man, bent and wrinkled and mean, looking like a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop, except for the massive golden chain about his neck and the dress of dark red velvet with an embroidered collar. His features were ugly; a large, coarse nose, a heavy, sensual mouth, small eyes, but very sharp and glittering; the hair thin and short, the skin muddy, yellow, wrinkled--Lorenzo de' Medici! ...|$|E
60|$|Let {{me explain}} a little: Certain things are bad {{so far as}} they go, such as pain, and no one, not even a lunatic, calls a tooth-ache good in itself; but a knife which cuts clumsily and with {{difficulty}} is called a bad knife, which it certainly is not. It is only not so good as other knives to which men have grown accustomed. A knife is never bad except on such rare occasions as that {{in which it is}} neatly and scientifically planted in the middle of one's back. The coarsest and bluntest knife which ever broke a pencil into pieces instead of sharpening it is a good thing in so far as it is a knife. It would have appeared a miracle in the Stone Age. What we call a bad knife is a good knife not good enough for us; what we call a bad hat is a good hat not good enough for us; what we call bad cookery is good cookery not good enough for us; what we call a bad civilization is a good civilization not good enough for us. We choose to call the great mass of the history of mankind bad, not because it is bad, but because we are better. This is palpably an unfair principle. Ivory may not be so white as snow, but the whole Arctic continent does not make <b>ivory</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Miss Cann painted {{flowers and}} card-screens elegantly, and [...] "finished" [...] pencil-drawings most elaborately for her pupils. She could copy prints, {{so that at}} a little {{distance}} you would scarcely know that the copy in stumped chalk was not a bad mezzotinto engraving. She even had a little old paint-box, and showed you one or two ivory miniatures out of the drawer. She gave John James what little knowledge of drawing she had, and handed him over her invaluable recipes for mixing water-colours--"for trees in foregrounds, burnt sienna and indigo"--"for very dark foliage, <b>ivory</b> <b>black</b> and gamboge"--"for flesh-colour," [...] etc. etc. John James went through her poor little course, but not so brilliantly as she expected. She was forced to own that several of her pupils' [...] "pieces" [...] were executed much more dexterously than Johnny Ridley's. Honeyman looked at the boy's drawings from time to time, and said, [...] "Hm, ha!--very clever--a great deal of fancy, really." [...] But Honeyman knew no more of the subject than a deaf and dumb man knows of music. He could talk the art cant very glibly, and had a set of Morghens and Madonnas as became a clergyman and a man of taste; but he saw not with eyes such as those wherewith Heaven had endowed the humble little butler's boy, to whom splendours of Nature were revealed to vulgar sights invisible, and beauties manifest in forms, colours, shadows of common objects, {{where most of the}} world saw only what was dull, and gross, and familiar. One reads in the magic story-books of a charm or a flower which the wizard gives, and which enables the bearer to see the fairies. O enchanting boon of Nature, which reveals to the possessor the hidden spirits of beauty round about him! spirits which the strongest and most gifted masters compel into painting or song. To others it is granted but to have fleeting glimpses of that fair Art-world; and tempted by ambition, or barred by faint-heartedness, or driven by necessity, to turn away thence to the vulgar life-track, and the light of common day.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coffee is a {{brand of}} coffee {{produced}} by the <b>Black</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coffee Company Ltd in northern Thailand from Arabica coffee beans consumed by elephants and collected from their waste. The taste of <b>Black</b> <b>Ivory</b> coffee is influenced by elephants' digestive enzymes, which breaks down the coffee's protein. [...] "Protein {{is one of the}} primary factors for bitterness in coffee. Less protein results in a coffee with less bitterness." [...] The coffee beans are digested within 15 to 70 hours, and are present with various other ingredients in the elephants' stomachs, which imparts specific flavors to the product. In contrast to the omnivorous civets which produce kopi luwak (civet coffee), elephants are herbivores. Herbivores utilize fermentation to help break down cellulose (green leafy matter).|$|R

50|$|Bone char is {{also used}} as a black pigment for artist's paint, printmaking, calligraphic and drawing inks {{as well as other}} artistic {{applications}} because of its deepness of color and excellent tinting strength.
