40|$|Zybrestat (combretastatin A- 4 <b>disodium</b> <b>diphosphate)</b> is {{currently}} in clinical trials as an antivascular anticancer agent. A similar fluorinated agent has shown promise as an antivascular agent and a radiolabelled version would enable further understanding of its biological activities. Herein is described the synthesis of a tritiated fluorinated analogue of Zybrestat...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{dependence}} of the hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures of phosphate emulsifying salts consisting of <b>disodium</b> hydrogenphosphate, tetrasodium <b>diphosphate,</b> pentasodium triphosphate, and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate and {{on the number of}} days of storage. The main goal was to find suitable statistical models in order to describe the dependence of the hardness examined on the composition of binary mixtures. Polynomial regression proved to be suitable for the global behaviour of the statistical relationship observed. Detailed observation of local changes was made by means of a fuzzy inference system. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness was gradually increasing with rising amount of polyphosphate in the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid increase in the hardness of the samples was determined when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising up to 50 - 60 %. A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content in the binary mixture (above 60 %) resulted in a similarly rapid decrease in the hardness of the processed cheeses...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{dependence}} of hardness of processed cheese spreads on the composition of binary mixtures containing <b>disodium</b> hydrogenphosphate, tetrasodium <b>diphosphate,</b> pentasodium triphosphate, and/or sodium salt of polyphosphate using advanced statistical models. Eleven percentage ratios were applied {{in each of the}} 6 types of binary mixtures. The study was focused on finding of suitable models in order to describe the dependence of hardness on the composition of binary mixtures. These models use fuzzy sets - especially as Fuzzy Inference System. Fuzzy inference system is able to identify possible nonlinear dependence between input variables and output variables in process. It can also work with data described in vague terms. In mixtures of polyphosphate with the other phosphates studied, hardness was increasing with the rising amount of polyphosphates within the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid grow in sample rigidity was determined when the amount of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising (up to 40 - 60 %). A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate concentration (above 50 - 60 %) resulted in a drop in rigidity of processed cheeses. Hardness of samples was increased during 30 -day storage...|$|R
