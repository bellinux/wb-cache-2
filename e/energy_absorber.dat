40|$|Knowledge of the {{behaviour}} of kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> or impact attenuating devices is {{of paramount}} importance to design and research engineers involved in the automobile, aircraft, spacecraft, and nuclear industries. The main function of these devices is to minimise injury to personnel, to protect cargo that contain hazardous materials or to protect delicate structures from possible impact damage. Such industries require these devices to dissipate kinetic energy into an irreversible form and more importantly, in a controlled and desired manner. The performance of kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> is significantly affected by various physical parameters such as material properties, mode of deformation and the nature of loading, with strain rate and inertial effects playing an important role due to high velocity impact. This work details the experimental and computational analysis of circular and oblong shaped kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> subjected to quasi-static and dynamic lateral loading. The objective of this research was twofold; firstly, to design optimised kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> which exhibit a desirable force-deflection response and secondly, to increase the specific energy absorbing capacity of such systems. The <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> were {{in the form of a}} nested system consisting of a number of mild steel tubes of varying diameters assembled internally. The longitudinal axis of each tube was in parallel and an eccentric tube configuration was used. These systems were compressed laterally using three different devices: a flat platen, a cylindrical rod and a longitudinal line load indenter. It was found that the optimised designs for both the circular and oblong shaped devices exhibited very desirable features in terms of its force-deflection response. This was achieved by using a simple design modification which was incorporated into the optimised designs. Also, it was concluded that the specific energy absorption capacity of these nested systems can be increased notably by introducing external constraints which subject them to extra volumetric deformation. Both objectives were achieved using the finite element method, the results of which were validated using experimental techniques. It can be concluded that a new family of kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> in the form of nested metallic systems have been designed which meet the objectives outlined and can thereby contribute to the literature in the field of kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> {{in the form of}} tubes in which the material used is predominantly mild steel and/or aluminium. A brief summary is also made of frusta type <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The common modes of deformation such as lateral and axial compression, indentation and inversion are reviewed. Theoretical, numerical and experimental methods which help to understand the behaviour of such devices under various loading conditions are outlined. Although other forms of energy absorbing materials and structures exist such as composites and honeycombs, this is deemed outside the scope of this review. However, a brief description will be given on these materials. It is hoped that this work will provide a useful platform for researchers and design engineers to gain a useful insight into the progress made over the last few decades in the field of tube type <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The main type of <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> in {{use today}} is a tearing <b>energy</b> <b>absorber.</b> This {{consists}} of a length of webbing specially sewn together to allow progressive tearing {{in case of a}} fall. Such devices can only be used once to arrest a serious fall, and will exhibit visible damage afterwards. The advantages of this type of absorber are that it is compact and that it can be easily verified that it is not being reused after a fall (particularly valuable in the case of hired equipment); the disadvantage is that it can be used only once, leaving the climber unprotected in case of a second fall.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Thin-walled {{tubes are}} widely used as <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> in various {{vehicles}} and moving parts. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the energy absorption characteristics of tubes with corrugations in different geometries, under lateral loading. In order to produce corrugations, an innovative solution is introduced. Quasi-static tests were conducted to study the effect of changing the corrugation geometry (type and amplitude). The results show that tubes with cor-rugations have a higher mean crushing force which is directly proportional to the number of corrugations and their amplitudes. Moreover, it was observed that corrugated tubes can absorb approximately four times more energy than the tubes without corrugations in the same sizes and weights. Finally, it was found that corrugated tubes are more effective in lateral direction as <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers,</b> as they present suitable force–deflection responses...|$|R

5000|$|Anchors {{used for}} {{lifeline}} anchorages {{are designed for}} 5000 lbs force per connecting user, and the standard permits an anchor to deform in order to absorb energy (adhesive anchors have higher design requirements because of aging loss). [...] The rope can be lifeline rope, which stretches to lengthen the fall distance as it absorbes energy; or static rope, which does not stretch and thus limits the fall distance, but requires the fall energy be absorbed in other devices. It is essential that the PPE be rated for Fall Arrest and PPE used with static line include an <b>energy</b> <b>absorber.</b> While the energy absorbing lanyards hold in excess of 5000 pounds when fully absorbed, most limit the load during the fall to under 1400 lbs. [...] Another common system is an HLL (Horizontal Life Line). These are linear anchoring devices, which allow workers to move along the whole length of the anchor, usually without needing to disconnect and fixing points of the anchorage.|$|E

However, some earlier lanyards use a [...] "V" [...] configuration. These were the first to be developed but suffer from a major limitation - it is essential to clip only one arm at a time onto the cable.

50|$|It is {{normally}} essential to include <b>energy</b> (or shock) <b>absorbers</b> within HLL {{in addition to}} those within the workers' PPE. Without such absorbers, the horizontal life line cannot deform significantly when arresting the fall. Because of the geometry of pulling across the horizontal line, this in turn results in large resolved forces being generated within the anchor system, sufficient to cause failure of the anchorage. This can occur even with <b>energy</b> <b>absorbers</b> being included in the PPE of the worker.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other type}} of <b>energy</b> <b>absorber</b> is a metal braking device with a rope passing through it and {{attached}} to the harness. Previously popular these have been largely withdrawn after the revaluation of via ferrata safety that occurred after the 2012 accident. [...] The device provides {{a high degree of}} resistance when the rope is pulled, thus gradually absorbing the energy of the fall. There were several variants of these absorbers. The advantage of such absorbers is that they can be used again after a fall, providing some protection while finishing the climb. Note that after any significant fall, the lanyard should be replaced. A length of the rope which passes through the plate hangs loosely from the plate while in use, so as to be available to be drawn through the plate if high fall forces occur. This [...] "tail" [...] tends to get in the climber's way; commercially made lanyards employ various methods to attach the tail to the harness and/or hold it in a compact bundle which can easily be pulled apart during deployment. If, however, the climber by seeking to secure the tail, impedes its ability to pull through the plate under load, excessive forces will not be dissipated and an unsafe situation is created.|$|E
