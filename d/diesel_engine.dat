5|$|The {{graphics}} engine used {{to power the}} game was christened the <b>Diesel</b> <b>Engine.</b> Grin developed this engine for flexibility and scalability, allowing the engine to be easily upgraded with new features. Based on DirectX, this meant the engine could be used across Windows and Xbox platforms. Grin worked closely with NVIDIA to incorporate then new technologies such as pixel and vertex shaders to render complex scenes. Ballistics was marketed by NVIDIA as a flagship title for their new series of GeForce 3 graphics cards. The game came bundled with various versions of the GeForce 3, with distribution of the bundled game handled by Interplay OEM. Later versions of the <b>Diesel</b> <b>Engine</b> would be used in Grin games such as the Windows version of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.|$|E

Like all of her sister boats, U-21 had no wartime successes.|$|E
5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> would drive the center shaft. However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E

There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, gasoline/petrol engines {{exhibited}} better {{throttle response}} than <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> This results from higher specific power output and higher maximum engine power, {{as well as}} the fact that lower-powered <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were disproportionately heavier. Recently <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> became able to outperform similar-sized petrol engines. Most naturally aspirated gasoline engines have better responsiveness than supercharged or turbocharged engines for engines with similar peak power outputs. However, factors such as improper maintenance, fouled spark plugs or bad injectors can reduce throttle response. <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> are less likely to lose throttle response, since their power comes from self-igniting fuel. Older <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> directly connect the accelerator pedal to the injection pump resulting in instant response.|$|R
50|$|HCCI {{combines}} {{characteristics of}} conventional gasoline <b>engine</b> and <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> combine stratified charge (SC) with compression ignition (CI), abbreviated as SCCI.|$|R

Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.|$|E
5|$|The U-boat {{conducted}} patrols off the Albanian {{coast in}} October 1917, but experienced {{the failure of}} the seal on her main hatch. The repairs kept the boat out of action until June 1918. But in July a piston in her <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> broke, knocking the submarine out {{of the rest of the}} war. At the end of World War I, U-21 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. U-21 had no wartime successes.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E

5|$|Important {{features}} {{incorporated in}} the line include four loops (spirals) and four 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages allowed for {{the replacement of the}} basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the König-class battleships would be powered by {{two sets of}} turbines on the outer shafts, while the center shaft would have utilized a MAN 6-cylinder 2-stroke <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> producing 12,000shp at 150rpm. Development of the diesel was protracted, however, and it was later decided that the diesel would be installed only in Grosser Kurfürst and Markgraf. Ultimately, the diesel was never installed {{in any of the}} König-class battleships. They were instead equipped with three sets of Parsons (König and Kronprinz), AEG-Vulcan (Grosser Kurfürst), or Bergmann (Markgraf) turbines driving 3.8m-wide three-bladed screws. Steam was supplied by three oil-fired and 12 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers operating at up to 16atmospheres of pressure.|$|E
5|$|SM U-21 {{was built}} at the Pola Navy Yard and was {{launched}} on 15 August 1916, {{and was the first}} of the class to be launched. U-21 was damaged in a diving trial in January 1917, requiring seven months for repairs. The U-boat was commissioned on 15 August 1917. In early October, U-21 conducted patrols off the Albanian coast, but a mid-October Mediterranean patrol was cut short by a leaky seal on her main hatch. After an additional eight months of repairs, U-21 again conducted patrols off Albania. A broken piston in her <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> cut short her war career. At Pola at the war's end, U-21 was ceded to Italy in 1920 as a war reparation and broken up. U-21 did not have any successes during the war.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> {{produce a}} variety of {{particles}} during combustion of the fuel/air mix due to incomplete combustion. The composition of the particles varies widely dependent upon engine type, age, and the emissions specification that the engine was designed to meet. Two-stroke <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> produce more particulate per unit of power than do four-stroke <b>diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> as they burn the fuel-air mix less completely.|$|R
