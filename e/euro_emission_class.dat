50|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>Euro</b> 1 <b>class</b> <b>emission</b> control regulation, it is only understandable that the engines gained a mass disadvantage compared with the earlier models.

50|$|The Wira saw its British {{debut in}} November 1993, {{where it was}} renamed 'Proton Persona'. The Persona {{effectively}} replaced the original Proton and the Mpi facelift in the British market, although both Mpi and Persona models were sold in parallel for a further three years, until Mpi imports ended in 1996. As with the Mpi, the Persona used multi point fuel injection {{to comply with the}} <b>Euro</b> <b>emissions</b> standards.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of pollution of the environment by emissions of dust particles produced by engines of cars and also {{deals with the}} measurement of the concentration of dust particles emitted in the exhaust gases of diesel engines meeting the different <b>EURO</b> <b>emission</b> categories. Dust particles greatly pollute the environment and endanger human health as well as the lives of other animals and plants. The aim of this work was to find out the difference in the producing of dust particles in the exhaust gases of passenger car's diesel engines that meet the different <b>emission</b> <b>EURO</b> standards. Measurements were carried out using experimental preparation of own production - the measuring station. The dust particles concentration measurement was performed on four diesel engine passenger cars that meet the EURO 1, EURO 3, EURO 5 and <b>EURO</b> 6 <b>emissions</b> standards and while idling. The measuring device DUST TRAK 8530 from the TSI Incorporated company was used for measuring...|$|R
