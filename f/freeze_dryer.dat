40|$|This paper {{describes}} a low-invasive temperature mapping system specially designed for vacuum and non accessibleenvironments, such as industrial <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers.</b> Thermal resistances {{tend to become}} quite hight in vacuum since convection is absent and even very small gaps have extremely conductive resistances. Temperature monitoring in the vacuum therefore requires sensors that do not inject power to minimize the self-heating and a {{special attention to the}} effect due to the involved thermal resistances. The proposed solution employs small autonomous measuring nodes that use a wireless connection to transmit the results and that are characterized to correct the thermal constant effect during temperature changes. The system has been designed for the monitoring of large <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers,</b> but its characteristics make it useful in many other vacuum conditions. The system is capable of monitoring the temperature of hundreds of points with an uncertainty of the order of a degree and with a cost per point of a few euros...|$|R
30|$|The {{choice of}} drying method at {{laboratory}} scale generally {{depends on the}} availability of drying equipment at a certain laboratory and not depends on the purposes of the research or the properties of studied FPH. Thus, it is difficult to classify the used equipment according to the studied properties of FPH. Generally, the mostly used drying equipment for research purposes is spray and <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Drying is an {{important}} step in the formulation and development of a pharmaceutical product. It is important to keep the residual moisture low enough to prevent product deterioration and ensure free flowing properties. The commonly used dryers include Fluidized - bed dryer, Vacuum tray dryer, Microwave dryer, Spray dryer, <b>Freeze</b> <b>dryer,</b> Turbo - tray dryer, Pan dryer, etc.|$|E
50|$|An {{increasingly}} popular trend is to freeze dry the animal. For {{all intents and}} purposes, a freeze-dried mount is a mummified animal that still has fur on it. The internal organs are removed during preparation; however, all other tissue remains in the body. (The skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still {{beneath the surface of}} the fur.) The animal is positioned into the desired pose, then placed into the chamber of a special freeze drying machine designed specifically for this application. The machine freezes the animal and also creates a vacuum in the chamber. Pressure in the chamber helps vaporize moisture in the animal's body, allowing it to dry out. The rate of drying depends on vapor pressure. (The higher the pressure, the faster the specimen dries.) Vapor pressure is determined by temperature of the chamber; the higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure is at a given vacuum. The length of the dry-time is important because rapid freezing creates less tissue distortion (i.e.; shrinkage, warping, and wrinkling) The process can be done with reptiles, birds, and small mammals such as cats, rodents, and some dogs. Large specimens may require up to six months in the <b>freeze</b> <b>dryer</b> before they are completely dry. Freeze drying is the most popular type of pet preservation. This is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal's body after death, which is a concern of owners (Most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount).In the case of large pets, such as dogs and cats, freeze dying is also the best way to capture the animal's expression as it looked in life (another important concern of owners). Freeze drying equipment is costly and requires much upkeep. The process is also time-consuming; therefore, freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal. The drawback to this method is that freeze-dried mounts are extremely susceptible to insect damage. This is because they contain large areas of dried tissue (meat and fat) for insects to feed upon. Traditional mounts are far less susceptible because they contain virtually no residual tissues (or none at all). Regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared, all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage. Taxidermy mounts are targeted by the same beetles and fabric moths that destroy wool sweaters and fur coats and that infest grains and flour in pantries.|$|E

30|$|The {{drying process}} of FPH is usually {{accomplished}} by {{a limited number}} of drying apparatus: they are typically spray dryers which provide convectional drying, and vacuum <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers</b> and roller drum dryers which utilize contact heat supply. From the experience, the authors suggest convection spray dryers as the most used drying systems at large scale in FPH production due to a satisfactory productivity, reasonable quality of the final FPH and a relative easiness of operation. The term “spray dryer” is used in this article to describe convectional spray dryers; the authors do not devote the work to spray drying using radiation or mixed heat transfer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} low-invasive {{temperature}} monitoring inside <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers.</b> During lyophilization, both {{the temperature of}} the freeze-dryer shelves and {{the temperature of the}} products have to be measured in order to control the process and to guarantee the product quality. In addition, temperature measurements are essential to obtain reliable information during the development of the freeze-drying receipt and to scale-up the process from the laboratory to the industrial scale. Unfortunately, many constrains make such measurements extremely difficult and not many measuring systems are available; in the paper the main problems related to the temperature measurements, along with some available solutions, are discussed. Then, a low invasive measurement system, that has been specifically developed to measure both the required temperatures, is presented and described...|$|R
30|$|Spray drying is {{a popular}} method used at {{different}} productions over years due to its high productivity. However, for research purposes its use {{is limited by the}} availability at a certain research laboratory, where <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers</b> are rather available. Nevertheless, some research laboratories are equipped by spray driers and a number of research works on FPH have been published. Thus, Abdul-Hamid et al. (2002) studied nutritional quality of spray-dried FPH from Black Tilapia. Recently, Morales-Medina et al. (2016) used spray drying for the microencapsulation of fish oil by FPH made from sardine and horse mackerel. The new research of Silveira Alvares et al. (2018) used spray-dried FPH for the examination of its effect on vascular function of healthy individuals. Published articles on spray-dried FPH are generally aimed on studying of different properties of FPH using one-mode adjusted spray-drying just as an operation in the technological line. This gap should be filled by relative research devoted to the influence of spray-drying mode on the properties of FPH.|$|R

40|$|The {{working fluid}} for the pulse tube {{refrigerator}} is Helium, which is non-toxic to humans and harmless to the environment. The Pulse Tube Refrigeration unit offers {{a viable alternative}} to units that currently require CFC and HCFC working fluids. Pulse Tube Refrigerators can be operated over wide range of temperatures. These units can be used in numerous space and commercial applications, including food freezers <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers.</b> It {{can also be used to}} cool detectors and electronic devices. The design of Pulse Tube Refrigeration Unit was based on Orifice Pulse Tube Concept. First the gas is compressed in a compressor. Next it floes through the compressor after cooler, where heat is rejected to the water cooled loop. Then the gas enters the regenerator and cold end heat exchanger where heat is added to the gas from surroundings. The gas finally enters the Pulse Tube, orifice and reservoir. These three components produce the phase shift of mass flow and pressure, which is necessary for cooling. The gas shuttles forth between hot and cold ends. Heat is lifted against the temperature gradient and rejected at hot end heat exchanger, which is water cooled...|$|R
50|$|Rotary-vane {{pumps are}} also a common type of vacuum pump, with {{two-stage}} pumps able to reach pressures well below 10−6 bar. These vacuum pumps are found in numerous applications, such as providing braking assistance in large trucks and diesel-powered passenger cars (whose engines do not generate intake vacuum) through a braking booster, in most light aircraft to drive gyroscopic flight instruments, in evacuating refrigerant lines during installation of air conditioners, in laboratory <b>freeze</b> <b>dryers,</b> and vacuum experiments in physics. In the vane pump, the pumped gas and the oil are mixed within the pump, and so they must be separated externally. Therefore, the inlet and the outlet have a large chamber, maybe with swirl, where the oil drops {{fall out of the}} gas. Sometimes the inlet has a venetian blind cooled by the room air (the pump is usually 40 K hotter) to condense cracked pumping oil and water, and let it drop back into the inlet. When these pumps are used in high-vacuum systems (where the inflow of gas into the pump becomes very low), a significant concern is contamination of the entire system by molecular oil backstreaming.|$|R
30|$|To {{fabricate}} PFC/QD nanoemulsions, two PFC materials [PFCE and PFOB] and {{two different}} colored QDs (emitting at 525, 606  nm) were used. For conventional hydrophobic ligand-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs to {{be compatible with}} PFC liquids, the hydrophobic ligands of QDs should be exchanged with PFDT. A 7  mg CdSe/ZnS QDs dispersed in toluene was mixed with 34  g PFC liquids containing 1  ml PFOT and methanol. After vigorous mixing of the two-phase solutions for 24  h, the CdSe/ZnS QDs were partitioned into the PFC phase. The QDs in PFC were then washed three times with methanol to remove the excess ligands from the solution. The PFC liquids containing CdSe/ZnS QDs were emulsified in an aqueous solution using surfactant mixtures. A surfactant mixture composed of 78.5  mol% lecithin, 20  mol% cholesterol, and 1.5  mol% DSPE-PEG 3400 -NHS were dissolved in chloroform, and the organic solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and a <b>freezing</b> <b>dryer</b> for 24  h. After dispersing the surfactant mixture into sterilized distilled water, the solution was sonicated. PFC/QD solution (40 % v/v), the surfactant mixture (2 % w/v) and phosphate buffered saline were mixed for 4  min using a homogenizer. The mixture was followed by microfluidization. A Microfluidizer M- 110 S (Microfluidics, Inc., Newton, MA) operating at a liquid pressure of approximately 20000  psi was used for all reported nanoemulsion preparations. The fabricated PFC/QDs nanoemulsions were separated using the size-exclusion column and were stored at 4 °C.|$|R

A number of uncertainty-representing mechanisms, such as probability theory, certainty factors, Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy logic, rough sets, non-numerical methods, and belief networks, were reviewed and compared. The proper application of uncertainty provides an effective and efficient way to represent knowledge;A knowledge-based system has been developed to assess the impacts of rebate programs on customer adoption of new technologies and, hence, the reductions in energy and demand. Three modes have been programmed: (1) one in which uncertainty is not considered, (2) another where fuzzy logic with linguistic variables is used to represent uncertainty, and (3) one in which uncertainty is represented using Dempster-Shafer theory with basic probability assignments. A correlation for rebate, expected (energy) savings, and customer adoption is employed in the knowledge base. Predictions for annual adoption of a new technology are made for specified useful life, rebate, and expected savings; or a suggested rebate can be determined for specified useful life, expected savings, and annual adoption. With input for energy use and demand for each technology, the impacts of rebate programs on energy use and power demand can be evaluated;This report and the knowledge-based system should help utilities determine these new technologies that are most promising and these strategies that should be emphasized in their energy management programs...|$|R

40|$|Blueberries {{are well}} known for their high {{anthocyanin}} content and the health benefits. Fresh blueberries have limited shelf life and thus are kept frozen or processed. Since freezing is expensive, low cost processing methods, particularly drying are being devised. Various drying treatments were compared with regard to drying time {{and quality of the}} dried product in terms of anthocyanin and polyphenolic contents as well as antioxidant activity. The drying treatments involved high temperature in a cabinet dryer and low temperature in a heat pump <b>dryer.</b> <b>Freeze</b> drying was used as a reference treatment. Highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L., cultivars Crunchie, Star, and Sharpe) and rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei, cultivars Climax, Powderblue, and Brightwell) blueberries were used in this study. Pre-treatments included osmotic dehydration or skin abrasion. The temperature and concentration of the osmotic solution were the main parameters contributing to the reduction of drying time. Mechanical skin abrasion was more effective than osmotic dehydration in reducing drying time and minimising the loss of anthocyanin and phenolic contents of the blueberries in air drying treatments. The thickness of cuticle and the structure of epicuticular waxes affected the drying rate of different cultivars of blueberries. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to identify different anthocyanins in the blueberry samples. Delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin were the main contributors to the total anthocyanin content of the fresh and dried samples. Degradation products of anthocyanins were observed in samples where the anthocyanin contents declined as a result of drying treatments. The anthocyanin content and profile, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of mulberries (Morus nigra), and Makiang (Cleistocalyx nervosum), a Thai native fruit, were also analysed. There {{was no significant difference between}} total anthocyanin content of blueberries and mulberries. In contrast, the total phenolic content and antioxidant effect of mulberry were significantly higher than those of blueberries and Makiang. Skin abrasion and high temperature drying resulted in the fastest drying rate and highest anthocyanin retention. Anthocyanin profiles differed in various cultivars of blueberries.
