Information in bank accounts can also be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the Abolition of Civil Imprisonment Act, no court shall {{have the power to}} order the civil {{imprisonment}} of a debtor for failure to pay a sum of money in terms of any judgment. This Act does not, however, affect the power of a court to grant an order for the committal of any person for contempt of court or to sentence a <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> to imprisonment in terms of any provision of the Magistrates' Courts Act for failing to satisfy the judgment.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 under Pennsylvania law, a <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> {{is not a}} {{party to}} a {{garnishment}} proceeding to condemn a claim due the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> from a third person, nor is the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> bound by a judgment discharging the garnishee.|$|E

50|$|Different {{enforcement}} mechanisms exist, including seizure {{and sale}} of the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor's</b> property or garnishment. Some jurisdictions, like California, also allow for additional enforcement mechanisms depending on the circumstances, such as suspending the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor's</b> driver's license or professional license. In Germany, a bailiff is responsible for enforcing the judgment and is empowered to use {{a number of different}} enforcement mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|The {{court may}} on good cause suspend, amend or rescind the order, {{especially}} where the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> can show that, after the deduction, there are insufficient means available {{to support the}} <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> and any dependants. Where the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> leaves the employment of the garnishee, the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> must advise the judgment creditor of {{the name and address}} of the new employer. The judgment creditor may then serve a certified copy of the order, together with a certificate of the balance of the debt owed, on the new employer. The new employer, as the new garnishee, is then bound by the order.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> {{may be able}} {{to obtain}} a [...] "satisfaction and release of judgment" [...] {{document}} from the judgment creditor. This document affirms that the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> has fulfilled any obligations relating to the judgment.|$|E
50|$|The {{emoluments}} attachment order “is a {{good way}} of proceeding against a <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> who does not possess sufficient attachable assets to pay off {{a significant portion of the}} debt.” Because the money goes directly from the employer to the judgment creditor, the latter’s attorney does not have to worry about the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> spending it before it can be attached. The <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> also has an interest in retaining his job. As long as he does so, the debt will continue to be paid.|$|E

50|$|The new {{regulations}} include a requirement {{to send a}} seven-day notice of enforcement to <b>judgment</b> <b>debtors,</b> {{an increase in the}} time delay between seizure and sale and how peaceable entry may be effected. There has also been reform of fees charged by HCEOs.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} options of {{protecting}} an IRA: (1) roll it {{over into a}} qualified plan like a 401(k), (2) take a distribution, pay the tax and protect the proceeds {{along with the other}} liquid assets, or (3) rely on the state law exemption for IRAs. For example, the California exemption statute provides that IRAs and self-employed plans' assets [...] "are exempt only to the extent necessary to provide for the support of the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> when the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor,</b> taking into account all resources that are likely to be available for the support of the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> when the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> retires." [...] What is reasonably necessary is determined on a case by case basis, and the courts will take into account other funds and income streams available to the beneficiary of the plan. Debtors who are skilled, well-educated, and have time left until retirement are usually afforded little protection under the California statute as the courts presume that such debtors will be able to provide for retirement.|$|E
5000|$|An {{emoluments}} attachment {{order is}} regarded {{as part of the}} procedure for the collection of debt. In this instance, the court orders the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> employer to make regular monthly deductions from the debtor’s salary, and to pay them to the judgment creditor.|$|R
50|$|If {{it appears}} that the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> total debts do not exceed R50,000, the court may grant the {{administration}} order in respect of his estate, and stay further proceedings, but may grant the judgment creditor the costs already incurred in connection with such proceedings.|$|R

50|$|Application for an {{emoluments}} attachment order may be {{made from}} the court of the district wherein the employer (that is, the garnishee) resides, carries on business or is employed; or alternatively, where the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> is employed by the State, the court of the district wherein the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> is so employed by the State.|$|E
50|$|If {{the court}} authorises the issuing of an emoluments-attachment order {{in terms of}} section 65J(1), the order must be issued in the form {{prescribed}} by the rules, and must contain sufficient information, including the identity number, work number or date of birth of the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor,</b> to enable the garnishee to identify the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Any debts {{which are}} owed or accruing {{from a third}} person to the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> may be {{attached}} and executed upon {{by way of a}} garnishee order. In terms of such an order, the third person, known as the “garnishee,” will be ordered to pay the debt, or part thereof, to the judgment creditor, rather than to the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once the {{emoluments}} attachment {{order has}} been issued and {{served on the}} emoluments attachment debtor or garnishee, a certain amount will be deducted from the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> salary by the garnishee {{at the end of}} every month, and paid over to the judgment creditor. The garnishee is entitled to deduct a five per cent commission for this service.|$|R
50|$|The court hears such further {{evidence}} {{as may be}} adduced (orally or by affidavit, or in such other manner as the court may deem just), and as is material to {{the determination of the}} <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> financial position, his ability to pay the judgment debt and his failure to do so. Witnesses may be summoned for the purpose of giving such evidence.|$|R
50|$|A writ or warrant of {{execution}} is {{issued by the}} registrar of the High Court or the clerk of the Magistrate’s Court. It instructs the sheriff of the court to attach and sell, by public sale, {{so much of the}} <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> property as is necessary to satisfy the judgment debt, plus the costs of the execution process. Thereafter, it is handed to the sheriff to execute.|$|R
50|$|When postponing the proceedings, {{the court}} informs the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> or the {{director}} or officer in {{question of the}} provisions of section 65E(1)(c), and may order the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor,</b> etc., to produce such documents as the court may specify at the hearing on the date determined by the court. The court may, in addition, stipulate such conditions as it deems fit.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{procedure}} adopted in the Magistrates’ Courts, there is a distinction between emoluments attachment orders (which relate to the attachment of the salary or wages owing or accruing to the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> by a third party), and garnishee orders (which relate to the attachment {{of all the other}} kinds of debts which may be owed to the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor</b> by a third party).|$|E
50|$|Imprisonment {{does not}} {{operate as a}} {{satisfaction}} or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned {{in the same manner}} as there had been no imprisonment. In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the Civil Procedure Rules procedure to obtain information from <b>judgment</b> <b>debtors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dumpster diving is {{commonly}} practiced by [...] "watchdog" [...] organizations seeking information on groups they are investigating. The Trinity Foundation successfully used this technique {{to report on}} the activities of televangelist Robert Tilton, and has also obtained information on Benny Hinn using this practice. [...] It is also sometimes used by attorneys or their agents when seeking to enforce court-ordered money judgments: the <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor's</b> trash may contain information about assets that can then be more-readily located for levying.|$|R
5000|$|Should {{the actual}} lender want to sue on the note, he {{should include the}} SBE parties as {{original}} defendants in mortgage default and foreclosure proceedings (state courts) and not as <b>judgment</b> <b>debtors</b> after garnering a judgment against the borrowers and their affiliates in Federal Bankruptcy Courts (See Pre-empting Workouts). That is why all Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS including RMBS and CMBS) mortgage loan purchase agreements have a [...] "repurchase" [...] provision to send the loans back to its originators.|$|R

50|$|In {{the present}} matter, {{the court was}} called upon to {{exercise}} what Sachs J described as a structured and disciplined value judgment, taking account of all the competing considerations that arose in {{the circumstances of the}} case, as to whether or not, in the open and democratic society based on freedom and equality contemplated by the Constitution, it was legitimate or acceptable or appropriate to continue to send defaulting <b>judgment</b> <b>debtors</b> to gaol in terms of the procedures set out in sections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates' Courts Act.|$|R

40|$|New York {{may have}} just become {{a great place to}} be a {{judgment}} creditor. In the summer of 2009, the Court of Appeals of New York handed down its decision in Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda Ltd. In Koehler, the court upheld a turnover order directing a garnishee to transfer a nonresident <b>judgment</b> <b>debtor’s</b> assets, deposited in a Bermuda bank, into New York. Under Koehler, assets anywhere in the world may now be garnishable in New York so long as the garnishee is subject to the state’s jurisdiction. This decision greatly broadens New York courts’ power to enforce judgments by reaching property located outside of New York. Accordingly, the decision is an incredible victory for judgment creditors, yet a serious defeat for <b>judgment</b> <b>debtors.</b> Because of New York’s status as a financial and corporate capital—and the concomitant number of institutions doing business within the state—this decision has a potentially far-reaching impact. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Koehler decision raises some serious constitutional and policy concerns. As some commentators fear, the decision may ultimately turn New York courts into a “mecca” for judgment creditors seeking to reach assets located anywhere in the world. This Comment seeks to explore the issues raised by the Koehler decision. In doing so, this Comment analyzes theories of due process and state power in the realm of postjudgment garnishments. This Comment ultimately concludes that the Koehler decision was correctly decided, particularly because it will afford judgment creditors an incredibly useful tool in satisfying their judgments...|$|R
