5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> suggest that the storm might hit the United States {{four or five days}} ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast {{the outer edge of the}} hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E

2500|$|The Georgetown II Water Supply & Sewer System Program was a US$30m project {{approved}} in 1999 that aimed [...] "to improve sanitary conditions in Georgetown and reduce {{current levels of}} environmental degradation by {{improving the quality of}} the water supply and sewerage services". The three program components were: (a) further improving the availability and quality of potable water and the reliability of the distribution system; (b) improving the sewerage system; and (c) strengthening the Georgetown Sewerage and Water Commissioners (GS), the service provider for Georgetown {{at the time of the}} project's approval and one of the two predecessors of GWI. After a cancellation of part of the funding as part of a debt relief package for Guyana, the size of the project was reduced to US$ 16.4million. [...] The project closed in 2010 after achieving only some of its objectives: Water pressure increased from 2 pound per square inch (psi) to 6 psi, short of the target of 10psi; the iron content of drinking water declined after two water treatment plants were commissioned in 2010; non-revenue water apparently declined, although exact numbers are not available; sewage pumps stations were built, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> determine if they will be properly operated and maintained; a septic tank disposal facility has been built, but was not operational; water metering in Georgetown was increased to 50%, short of the target of 80%; and no significant improvements were reached in terms of collection efficiency and cost recovery.

And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time".

2500|$|The floods were {{a result}} of heavy {{rainfall}} caused by Tropical Cyclone Tasha that combined with a trough during the peak of a La Niña Modoki event. The 2010 La Niña Modoki weather pattern, which brings wetter conditions to eastern Australia, was the strongest since 1973. This La Niña event caused a prolonged event of heavy rainfall over Queensland river catchments. Record or near to record sea surface temperatures were recorded off the Queensland coast in late 2010. December 2010 was Queensland's wettest on record, with record-high rainfall totals set in 107 locations for the month. The state's average rainfall level of [...] exceeded the previous record of [...] set in 1975. 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900 and the Australian continent's third-wettest year. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thought climate change was a contributing factor in the unusually high precipitation rates. He attributed a half-degree Celsius rise in ocean temperatures around Australia to global warming which produces extra water vapour and intensifies the monsoon. Other scientists say that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> draw such a conclusion. Assertions were also made by Professor Hubert Chanson, an expert in dam and reservoir engineering with extensive firsthand knowledge of the Wivenhoe system, that mismanagement of the Wivenhoe Dam might be {{a contributor to the}} some flooding in the lower Brisbane valley. While an expert engineer, Michael O'Brien—a senior manager of an ASX-listed resources company and an outside consultant evaluating cause—agrees that [...] "massive releases of water from Wivenhoe Dam on Tuesday, January 11, did indeed produce most of the flooding in the Brisbane River the following afternoon, with a peak {{in the early hours of}} Thursday morning, January 13. The dam's releases into the Brisbane River also caused the Bremer River, which winds through the city of Ipswich, and the Lockyer Creek to back up and cause much of the flooding outside Brisbane." [...] This was corroborated by a panel of engineers hired by Insurance Council of Australia. O'Brien also found that the Wivenhoe Dam and Somerset Dam did not hold the maximum capacity they were capable of holding during the crisis period, which would have significantly alleviated flooding. Only one source, Neal Ashkanasy, who specialises in social and organisational psychology (and 35 years ago was involved in the design of Wivenhoe Dam), found fault with these results and instead finds that the dam was operated correctly throughout the time of the storm and the flood that followed, saying the [...] "dam was run with outstanding precision." ...|$|E
