5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone critical to the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein.

5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe.

In each case that the shapeshifter has appeared in a meaningful role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E
5|$|Even though racial {{politics}} often {{resulted in}} the company receiving untrained replacements, it performed well in many small-scale engagements during this time. In the summer of 1951, the company was employed along the front line as an advance force to push back Chinese attacks as the front lines became more static. The company was highly regarded for <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> capturing and holding Hill 581 during the Battle of the Soyang River, in which the company inflicted hundreds of casualties on the Chinese without a single Ranger being killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} <b>its</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Force is {{the action}} of one body on another. A force is either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of <b>its</b> <b>action.</b> The action of a force is characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of <b>its</b> <b>action,</b> and by <b>its</b> point of application. Thus, force is a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

5|$|In February, {{the unit}} fought in Operation Star, whose {{objective}} was {{the capture of}} the important city of Kharkov in eastern Ukraine, and participated in the capture of that city. As the Soviet advance outran its supply lines, the corps was slowly worn down and was virtually destroyed after being surrounded by a German counteroffensive in the Third Battle of Kharkov during late February and early March. Corps commander Koptsov was among those killed in the fierce fighting. The corps was rebuilt in the following months and {{became part of the}} new 3rd Guards Tank Army, fighting in Operation Kutuzov during late July, the Soviet counteroffensive after the Battle of Kursk. For <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> in the offensive, the corps was converted into the 7th Guards Tank Corps.|$|E

He also fronted a video campaign to help the charity Save The Children in its mission to aid young Syrian refugees. He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> regarding the refugee problem. He also gave nightly speeches after his curtain call as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end of the run, the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines {{was sent}} {{south of the}} DMZ for several months to join Task Force Yankee in Operation Taylor Common near An Hoa. This three-month {{operation}} focused on destroying the primary base for PAVN forces operating across several provinces and 3rd Battalion was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> during the operation. Ten Marines from 3rd Battalion were killed during the operation (out of 183 total US fatalities), and American forces captured numerous quantities of PAVN supplies. One Marine, Lance Corporal (LCPL) William R. Prom, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry during Taylor Common.|$|E

Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. Government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned <b>its</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E

5|$|On February 26, 2016, Media General {{obtained}} a preliminary injunction against Gray {{for violating the}} SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray of using the spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> were {{required in order to}} comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.|$|E

5|$|On taking office, Welensky {{was forced}} to take sides in the Suez Crisis. The {{government}} of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for <b>its</b> <b>actions,</b> but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics. In {{the aftermath of the}} Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1966, air-pollution control {{had largely}} been the {{responsibility}} of states and political subdivisions of states like counties and municipalities (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, {{and to the extent}} that it did, <b>its</b> <b>actions</b> supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters under the guidance of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations {{had tried}} {{several times to}} {{reconcile}} {{the government of the}} Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under Moïse Tshombe with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting <b>its</b> <b>actions,</b> the United Nations Operation in the Congo became increasingly impatient towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to a breaking point in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant authorised a retaliatory offensive to eliminate secessionist opposition.|$|E
