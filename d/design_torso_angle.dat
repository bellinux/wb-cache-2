40|$|FMVSS 202 a and {{the head}} {{restraint}} gtr specify a dynamic sled test with Hybrid III dummy {{as an alternative to}} static tests. However, the poor biofidelity of Hybrid III dummy and the evaluation method based on the neck rearward rotational angle of the dummy during rear impact are urgent issues. To solve these issues, a dynamic evaluation of OC-T 1 displacement, corrected for the seat back rearward inclination (hereinafter called “dynamic backset”), using BioRID II which has superior biofidelity, was studied to establish a test method with higher effectiveness, repeatability and reproducibility. From dynamic Backset evaluations by dynamic tests and simulations using IIWPG crash pulse on various types of seats and analysis of real world minor neck injuries involving such seats in Japan, the following new facts were found. (1) Dynamic backset can evaluate the effectiveness of various types of seats with whiplash mitigation features, such as reactive, passive, and WHIPS, more accurately than neck rearward rotation of Hybrid III. Since the seat effectiveness increases as dynamic backset decreases, it is appropriate for a dynamic evaluation parameter as an alternative of static backset tests. (2) By setting each seat back to its <b>design</b> <b>torso</b> <b>angle,</b> instead of 25 degrees for every seat, the variation in BioRID II installation is decreased, resulting in higher repeatability and reproducibility. (3) According to the correlation analysis among real world accidents, minor neck injury phenomena, and various evaluation indicators, reduction of dynamic backset has an inhibitory effect on occurrence of minor neck injuries.

40|$|Introduction: The {{aerodynamic}} drag of a cyclist in time trial (TT) position is {{strongly influenced by}} the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> (Underwood et al. 2011). To minimize drag, cyclists lower their <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Along with the drag the cyclists’ peak power output decreases. There should be a trade-off between the loss in power output and drag as function of cycling velocity. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} energy expenditure which {{is a function of the}} workload divided by the gross efficiency (GE). The workload to overcome drag decreases with smaller <b>torso</b> <b>angles,</b> while the GE decreases accordingly. Previous literature suggested that the aerodynamic losses outweigh the loss in power output (Lukes et al. 2005). However, these statements are only valid for elite TT cycling velocities, e. g. > 45 km/h. To our best knowledge, there is no published prediction at which speed the aerodynamic power loss starts to dominate. Therefore the aim of this study is to predict the optimal TT cycling position as a function of velocity to improve the performance of non-elite cyclists. Methods: Two models were developed to determine the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> of TT cyclists: a ‘Power Output Model’ and a ‘Metabolic Efficiency Model’. The Power Output Model predicts the optimal cycling position by maximizing the peak power output minus the power losses due to drag and roll resistance. The Metabolic Efficiency Model minimizes the required cycling energy. Model input parameters were experimentally collected of 19 trained competitive time trial cyclists (Fintelman et al. 2012). The main input variables were the power output, frontal area and GE of the cyclists in different <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> positions (0, 8, 16 and 24 °). The optimal cycling <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> was predicted for speeds between 18 - 50 km/h. Results and discussion: For both models, the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> is dependent on the cycling velocity, and the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> exhibited a sigmoid-like shape, with decreasing <b>torso</b> <b>angles</b> at increasing velocities. The Power Output Model curve was shifted to a higher velocity, which could be explained by the different approach of the models. The aerodynamic losses outweighed the power losses for velocities above 45 km/h, which goes in line with the literature. For cycling velocities below 30 km/h the power loss and gross efficiency due to position change were dominant. Furthermore, it is shown that a fully horizontal torso is not optimal. Conclusion and recommendations: It is suggested that despite some limitations, the models give valuable information about the optimal TT cycling position at different speeds for non-elite cyclists. This study showed it is beneficial to ride in a more upright TT position when velocities are below 30 km/h, while at speeds above 45 km/h an almost flat back is optimal. Furthermore, for speeds between 32 - 40 km/h in an endurance event it is advisable to lower the torso despite the fact that the power output in a more aerodynamic position is decreased. In contrast, in sprinting or in variable conditions (wind, undulating course, etc) at these speeds it is more beneficial to ride in a more upright TT position. Our future research will attempt to measure the {{aerodynamic drag}} of all participants in a wind tunnel, to implement a more valid drag coefficient and thus improving the validity of the models. Furthermore, to increase the ecological validity the effect of crosswind will be implemented in future. References: Fintelman, Highton, Adams, Sterling, Hemida, Li (2012) ECSS annual conference.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for fall detection based on two features and their motion characteristics extracted from the human torso. The 3 D positions of the hip center joint and the shoulder center joint in depth images are used to build a fall detection model named the human torso motion model (HTMM). Person’s <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and centroid height are imported as key features in HTMM. Once a person comes into the scene, the positions of these two joints are fetched to calculate the person’s <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Whenever the angle is larger than a given threshold, the changing rates of the <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and the centroid height are recorded frame by frame in a given period of time. A fall can be identified when the above two changing rates reach the thresholds. By using the new feature, falls can be accurately and effectively distinguished from other fall-like activities, which are very difficult for other computer vision-based approaches to differentiate. Experiment results show that our approach achieved a detection accuracy of 97. 5 %, 98 % true positive rate (TPR) and 97 % true negative rate (TNR). Furthermore, the approach is time efficient and robust because of only calculating the changing rate of gravity and centroid height...|$|R

Utilizing the direct kinematics and inverse kinematics, the kinematic model for the robot is developed. The derivation of joint angle equations for 6 links Robot, walking on a slopping surface, is a direct approach in this research. The development of hip trajectory is another important invention specific to this research. The dynamic stability is analyzed by utilizing ZMP criteria. The calculation of ZMP for this model is very complex and based on mechanics theories. The selection of iteration method to calculate linear accelerations of each link (which are used to calculate ZMP) is guaranteed by simulation results. The dynamic stability is analyzed for lower body using ZMP simulation results. For this case the "Dynamic" Balance Margin (DBM) is introduced and requirement for stability is also introduced.

The dynamically stable human walking on slopes are very complex and this thesis address this problem by starting from lower body {{and in the middle}} by adding a torso with the intention of gaining dynamic stability and finishes showing the effectiveness of the variation of <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> The ZMP formula presented in the paper of Prof. Miomir Vukobratovic is involved with huge computations and due to that most of the researches in this field have chosen alternatives such as GA and NN to find the ZMP. Although it is convenient to use GA and NN to avoid mathematical calculation the accuracy of resultant ZMP is questionable. The original ZMP equation has been used extensively in all cases to calculate ZMP in this thesis and rather verifies the accuracy of this concept. The simulations have been performed to verify the accuracy of the kinematics models that has been created before moving to the ZMP calculations. The effectiveness of the variation of <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> on the dynamic stability of the bipedal robot has been analyzed by varying slope angle, step length and step time. It is indicated using real ZMP calculations the bipedal robot can maintain its dynamic stability while walking on slopes at any circumstances...|$|R

The overall {{aim of this}} research is to improve the understanding of the effect of cycling position and crosswinds on the aerodynamics and performance of a cyclist. The first part of this thesis focuses on cycling position. To minimise air resistance, cyclists lower their torso to become more aerodynamic. Results show that lowering <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> is associated with impairment of physiological functioning, which can be explained by a combination of mechanical and muscular factors. Consequently, there is a trade-off between aerodynamic gains and physiological impairment. Therefore a mathematical model has been developed predicting the optimal <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> at different cycling speeds. The second part of this thesis aims to understand the flow mechanics around a cyclist subjected to crosswinds. Both wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow around a cyclist are used to reveal the effect of crosswinds on cyclists in different cycling positions.

Despite {{the existence of}} regulations intended to prevent head injuries, these remain the most common serious injuries sustained by children in crashes. In this study, nine frontal sled tests using a Hybrid III 6 YO and three tests performed with a child-size adult PMHS were compared, with focus on the kinematic responses (especially of the head) and the seatbelt forces generated during the impact. Two different restraint systems (a pretensioning, force-limiting seatbelt, and a non pretensioning force-limiting standard belt) and two different impact speeds (29 km/h and 48 km/h) were compared.

BackgroundFall victims may develop suspension trauma, a potentially fatal reduction of return blood flow from legs to the heart and brain, after a successfully arrested fall {{if they are not}} rescued quickly or the harness does not fit them well. MethodFor this study, 20 men and 17 women with construction experience were suspended from the dorsal D-ring of a full-body fall-arrest harness. Their suspension tolerance time, physical characteristics, and harness fit levels were assessed.

This is especially true when stylistic changes are needed, for example, to reflect a character’s changing mood, differentiate one character from another or meet the precise desires of an animator. We introduce a system for editing animation data that is particularly well suited to making stylistic changes. Our approach transforms the joint angle representation of animation data into a set of pose parameters more suitable for editing. These motion drives include position data for the wrists, ankles and center of mass, as well as the rotation of the pelvis. We also extract correlations between drives and body movement, specifically between wrist position and the <b>torso</b> <b>angles.</b> The system solves for the pose at each frame based on the current values of these drives and correlations using an efficient set of inverse kinematics and balance algorithms.

In this system, ten body parts including head, torso, arms and legs are extracted to build a 2 D human body model. One way to decompose human silhouette into different parts is to generate cuts between the negative minimum curvature (NMC) points. However, due to the self-occlusion problem and left-right ambiguity, each individual body part cannot be successfully identified in every frame. Therefore, in addition to utilizing the NMC points, we design a forward and backward tracking mechanism to identify the location of head in each frame. The <b>torso</b> <b>angle</b> and size are determined by integrating multiple-frame information with the modified solution of Poisson equation.

Cushion length was varied from production length of 450 mm to a shorter length of 350 mm. Lap belt geometry was set to rear, mid, and forward anchorage locations that span the range of allowable lap belt angles found in real vehicles. Six tests each were performed with the standard Hybrid III 6 YO and 10 YO ATDs. One additional test was performed using a booster seat with the 6 YO. An updated version of the UMTRI seating procedure was used to position the ATDs that positions the ATD hips further forward with longer seat cushions to reflect the effect of cushion length on posture that has been measured with child volunteers. ATD kinematics were evaluated using peak head excursion, peak knee excursion, the difference between peak head and peak knee excursion, and the minimum <b>torso</b> <b>angle.</b> Shortening the seat cushion improved kinematic outcomes, particularly for the 10 YO.

Using a digitizing stylus, the three-dimensional positions of three anatomical landmarks on the scapula were recorded for 10 manual wheelchair users in six different statically held hand positions (- 30 °, - 15 °, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 60 °) on the pushrim. In each hand position, a motion analysis system recorded the coordinates of infrared markers on the arm and torso. Scapular, humeral, and <b>torso</b> <b>angles</b> were computed using an Euler angle decomposition method for each position relative to the torso. At the beginning of the push, the scapula was rotated slightly upward (1. 5 °), minimally protracted (15 °), and maximally tipped forward (22 °). In addition, the humerus was maximally extended, abducted and internally rotated. As subjects moved forward along the pushrim, the protraction angle increased while the forward tipping angle decreased. The humerus became increasingly more flexed as the push progressed with small changes observed in humeral abduction and internal rotation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis procedure (p < 0. 01) revealed that the torso, humeral flexion/extension and abduction angles are good predictors for estimating forward tipping and upward/downward rotation of the scapula. The regression equations enable researchers to estimate scapular orientation during propulsion which could provide further insight into specific biomechanical factors that lead to shoulder pathology...|$|R

A {{study was conducted to}} de-velop and evaluate a redesign of a self-checkout system with a focus on issues related to physical accessibility for wheelchair users. Two checkout station prototypes were huilt: a full-scale model of an existing system and a full-scale model of a system with design modifica-tions (e. g., inclusion of appropriate wheelchair clear-ance under the workstation, reduced vertical position of the credit card reader, etc.). Five wheelchair users and 10 non-wheelchair users performed simulated self-checkout activities using hoth workstations. The principal independent variable was workstation type (standard design vs. modified design). The dependent measures were productivity (time to complete a trans-action), shoulder flexion <b>angle,</b> <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angle,</b> and the user's subjective assessment of the experience. The results {{of this study indicate that}} workstation type did not influence productivity levels in either partici-pant group (wheelchair users or non-wbeelchair us-ers). Posture, on the other hand, was significantly im-proved: the peak shoulder angle was reduced hy 64 % in wheelchair users and by 69 % in the non-wheelchair user group. Peak flexion <b>angle</b> of the <b>torso</b> was also reduced by 67 % for wheelchair users. Subjective feed-hack from the wheelchair user group supported the postural data by showing an overall preference for the redesigned workstation, whereas the non-wheelchair group showed no preference between the two.

50|$|Both as {{an action}} figure and comic book {{character}} (first drawn by artist Jim Watson in a strip written by Gerry Day) Baron Ironblood appears dressed in all white suit (jacket and trousers) {{with a red}} 'V' <b>design</b> on the <b>torso,</b> together with a skull and crossbones decoration, the insignia of the Red Shadows. He also wears long black boots, reminiscent of German military uniforms of World War II. Various editions of the figure were produced with either black or white gloves.|$|R

He developed the delivery after being struck in the forearm with a ball in high school by C. J. Woodrow (a former Philadelphia Phillies farmhand). He then began to throw side arm and play shortstop due to his injury. When it healed, he could not change back to over the shoulder and his unique delivery stayed the way it is. He still has a lump in his forearm where he was struck.|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Accurate {{anatomical}} inputs for biomechanical {{models are}} necessary for valid estimates of internal loading. The magnitude of the moment arm of the lumbar erector muscle group is known to vary {{as a function of}} such variables as gender. Anatomical evidence indicates that the moment arms decrease during torso flexion. However, moment arm estimates in biomechanical models that account for individual variability have been derived from imaging studies from supine postures. PURPOSE: Quantify the sagittal plane moment arms of the lumbar erector muscle group as a function of torso flexion, and identify individual characteristics that are associated with the magnitude of the moment arms as a function of torso flexion. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Utilization of a 0. 3 Tesla Open magnetic resonance image (MRI) to image and quantify the moment arm of the right erector muscle group as a function of gender and torso flexion. METHODS: Axial MRI images through and parallel to each of the lumbar intervertebral discs at four <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angles</b> were obtained from 12 male and 12 female subjects in a lateral recumbent posture. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the optimization process used to increase the kicking skills of humanoid players. The kicking movement consists of making a step forward to put the support foot next to the ball to kick, then to execute the kicking motion by rocking the leg that must strike the ball. The rocking motion of the leg passes through three positions; the first position is the leg being raised backward, the second is the leg in position of strike, and the third is the leg forward to sweep the ball. The optimization process is an evolution of skills parameters guided by a evaluation function that aims to send the ball as far as possible. To optimize the kick a rocking motion of the torso is also introduced. The parameters used for each one of the three kicking positions are the <b>angle</b> of the <b>torso,</b> the <b>angle</b> of the foot sole, the longitudinal and the vertical coordinates of the foot toe. Thanks to this technique it is possible to increase the distance of the kicked ball by 34 %. I...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the effect of different stroke rates on various kinematic parameters during 1000 m outrigger canoeing. Sixteen, experienced female outrigger canoeists completed three 1000 m outrigger ergometer time trials, one trial each using a self-selected, a Hawaiian (65 strokes·min- 1) stroke rate. Stroke rate, stroke length, stroke time, proportion {{of time spent in}} propulsion and recovery, <b>torso</b> flexion <b>angle</b> and 'twist' were measured and compared with repeated measures ANOVAs. Stroke rate, stroke length and stroke time were significantly different across all interventions (p < 0. 05) despite no difference in the percentage of time spent in the propulsive and recovery phases of the stroke. Stroke length and stroke time were negatively correlated to stroke rate for all interventions (r = - 0. 79 and - 0. 99, respectively). Female outrigger canoeists maintain consistent stroke kinematics throughout a 1000 m time trial, most likely as a learned skill to maximize crew paddling synchrony when paddling on-water. While the Hawaiian stroke rate resulted in the greatest trunk flexion movement and 'twist' action, this potential increased back injury risk may be offset by the slow stroke rate and long stroke length and hence slow rate of force development...|$|R
