We got Fanny a dress on the sly, gaudy black velvet and <b>Duchesse</b> <b>lace.</b> And alas! she was only able to wear it once. But we'll hope {{to see more of}} it at Samoa; it really is lovely. Both dames are royally {{outfitted}} in silk stockings, etc. We return, as from a raid, with our spoils and our wounded. I am now very dandy: I announced two years ago that I should change. Slovenly youth, all right--not slovenly age. So really now I am pretty spruce; always a white shirt, white necktie, fresh shave, silk socks, O a great sight!--No more possible.|$|E

50|$|Boué Soeurs {{was known}} for {{creating}} elaborate ensembles with very feminine designs. Signature elements included fine Alençon and <b>Duchesse</b> <b>lace,</b> embroidery, ribbonwork, and gold and silver textiles. While some of their evening dresses retailed for $145-150 in the 1920s, designs with more exotic materials could {{cost as much as}} $2,000. Among the house's more elegant offerings was the robe de style, a design popularised by Jeanne Lanvin, which they continued to produce into the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic {{features}} are the roses {{with three or}} five petals, frequently arranged in trails. Unlike the <b>Duchesse,</b> the <b>lace</b> has no gimps. A Brussels variant has needle lace pearls mounted on {{the hearts of the}} roses, a Brugges variant lacks the pearls. A special variant connects the flowers with short crinkly edges. Another variant has needle lace fillings. The lace was almost exclusively made of fine linen threads. A piece of lace may look irregular when different parts were created by different people, tension and number of pairs may vary.|$|R

However, I cannot now buy the <b>Duchesse</b> of Sevres' <b>lace,</b> which I had promised her to do. It is rather awkward. However, the best way always is to speak the truth. I must tell the duchess I am powerless, {{and that we are}} the victims of a revolution, like herself." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1870s {{the second}} French empire collapsed, {{concurrently}} fashion changed. The cheaper guipures were affected but the better Brussels laces stayed {{in demand for}} wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. [...] Individuality of lace types decreased and interest for making lace as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the lace industry revived with imitations of old laces. Aalst developed a lace with a technique based on <b>Duchesse</b> <b>lace.</b> The frequent little roses gave the lace its name: Rosaline. The same name {{has been used for}} a seventeenth century Venetian needle lace with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The lace is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled.|$|E
50|$|Still {{new types}} of lace are being {{developed}} such as the 3D Rosalibre and a colored version of Milanese lace by borrowing rolls from <b>Duchesse</b> <b>lace</b> to store various shades and colors. Other artists are giving grounds a major role by distorting and varying stitches, pin distances and thread sizes or colours. The variations are explored by experimentation and mathematics and algorithms. The lace maintaining its shape without stiffening {{is no longer a}} requirement. Inspiring journals, guilds and foundations show that old techniques with a new twist can challenge young people to create works that can definitely classify as art.A Dutch design graduate in 2006 discovered bobbin lace was a technique to make a fancy fence. The first fences became museum pieces. The fences are now produced in Bangalore by concrete rebar plaiters.|$|E
