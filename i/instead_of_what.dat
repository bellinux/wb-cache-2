25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful when a company or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a happy face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they have substantially cognized.|$|E

500|$|As Madsen has described, Cisneros's [...] "effort to {{negotiate}} a cross-cultural identity {{is complicated by the}} need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures." [...] The lives of all Cisneros’s female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: [...] "There's always this balancing act, we've got to define what we think is fine for ourselves <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> our culture says." ...|$|E

[...] Bierman wrote that, while the Beatles held a familiar role as pioneers in rock music's new developments, the album showed Harrison breaking away and [...] "creating fresh and unique sounds" [...] of his own. In February 2011, the website Death and Taxes similarly identified the album as one of Harrison's two [...] "Forgotten Solo Gems", along with Electronic Sound.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students. Stone said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us. We believe the first way, that society controls you and makes you a better person, ultimately, because when you're little, you're just a little asshole." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of the group's existence, it seemed [...] "logical" [...] to develop a {{television}} program that both entertained and conveyed sound and developmentally appropriate values. [...] At the time, according to Field, Australian children's TV [...] "was an extremely staid and cautious genre", so it was difficult for them to break into it. [...] They filmed a television pilot for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) because they felt a program on the network would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market, but as The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) reported in 2002, [...] "the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences". Also according to the SMH, the ABC told them that they could not communicate with children, and that the members of the group should [...] "not speak, just sing". The ABC insisted that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the SMH called their [...] "trademark colourful skivvies and black trousers", they wear shorts and caps. [...] The Wiggles responded to this criticism by creating thirteen episodes of a self-produced television series, The Wiggles, which they funded from their tours and video sales. [...] In this series, and in most of their early series, they cut costs by using two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video.|$|E

An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do.

After getting fired from the noodle house, SpongeBob goes home and prepares some homemade pet food for Gary after noticing that they're out of store bought food. Gary loves the food and even Patrick loves it as well. Eventually, the door rings and SpongeBob answers but is stashed into a body bag shaped like a hot dog bun and taken back to the hot dog restaurant, where he is forced to work, because, as it turns out, the customers actually loved the weenie patties that SpongeBob created. Soon, all four of the restaurant managers who fired SpongeBob before are fighting over him, because it turns out that their customers loved the patty creations he made.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the decades}} {{numerous}} critics and skeptics have investigated Adamski's claims. The aliens Adamski {{claimed to have}} met in the 1950s were described by him as [...] "human beings from another world", usually light-skinned, light-haired humanoids that would later be called Nordic aliens. Adamski claimed in his books that these [...] "alien humans" [...] came from Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system. However, none of the planets he mentioned are capable of supporting human life, due to their environmental conditions. The first alien Adamski claimed to have met was from Venus, yet the atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, it has clouds which rain a toxic substance thought to be sulfuric acid, the atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen, and the average surface temperature of Venus is 464°C. In one of his books, Adamski described a trip he took {{to the far side}} of the Moon in a UFO, where he claimed to see cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains; he also claimed that the photographs of the Moon's far side that were taken by the Soviet lunar probe Luna 3 in 1959 were altered to depict a barren, lifeless surface <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he saw. However, all scientific evidence, as well as later lunar trips by American astronauts, clearly showed that the far side of the Moon is barren of life and has no atmosphere.|$|E

Can anyone imagine Mark Twain, that admirable author, writing even a tolerable imitation of authors so intellectually individual as Hugo or Charlotte Brontë?

The enemies of Meredith call his gospel too subtle, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it is, a gospel, if anything, too robust.
