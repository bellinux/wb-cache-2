Then Avalanche team is replaced (on their suggestion) by 2- and 3-year-old kids due to [...] "mental hell they had" [...] (kids {{were meant to}} play with other kids between intermissions and they promised to their friend suffering leukemia that they will win for him). Kids obviously cannot rivalize with professional hockey players and they lose 31-2 and in addition all <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> injured due to extremely brutal play from Red Wings including intentional skate kicks and punching. Red Wings are celebrating win and kid with leukemia dies just because they lost match, so he lost with sickness. Also in the episode [...] "Its Christmas in Canada", when the boys are in Canada, {{one of the members}} of the Canadian crowd is an ice hockey player, no doubt a reference to the popularity of the sport in Canada.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007, Thoothoor is {{the home}} of several {{significant}} economic sources. The main business is Shark catching, using modern equipments such as GPS and other Navigation tools. The average cost of one fishing boat is 15 - 20 lakhs in Indian currency. Fishermen usually go fishing in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. Boat owners travel in and around Tamil Nadu state and neighboring states such as Kerala, and the more distant state of Maharashtra. Now a few boat owners have moved to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands for deep sea fishing. The sweat of our boat owners and fishermen working with them make wonders to their generation. Fisherman support their families by fishing and hence their families are able to afford higher education. Thus, just like modern cities most of the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> higher education in a good atmosphere with a tremendous amount of good energy. The positive energy flows and flourishes in success's path on each and every Thoothoor native. The children should be very proud to have had such hard working ancestors and parents. The main road allows money to be exchanged from the shark business and shark merchandise, as well as some other fish on a small level. In terms of jobs, in Thoothoor there are a few main sectors, {{a large number of people}} from this place are working in their respective industries such as IT, manufacturing, education, educational management, the medical field, business management, mechanical engineering, marine engineering, electrical engineering, lawyers, etc. All such people are trained professionals, graduates, and a few PhD holders in mathematics, history, Tamil and physics. There are masters in IT professional, fish merchandise, teachers in education sectors and a few health services. A few hundred people are working in the Persian Gulf in countries such as UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc. A fewer number of people working are in the UK, the USA, Canada and New Zealand. The mechanical engineers and marine engineers work on international and local ships. Some MBAs are working at south Indian bank. Some marine engineers work in international ships in the deep sea. They travel to various countries. There are a few hundred natives of Thoothoor working in Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Thiruvananthapuram. The few people working locally work in small businesses and agriculture.|$|E

The violence she experiences from her husband is in part reflected in the violent attitude she displays towards her children as she shouts at and beats them constantly.

5000|$|My {{search for}} the perfect {{collaborator}} came to a sudden and successful conclusion on a lovely May morning in 1954, in storybook Heidelberg. How clearly its details pierce the dimming mists of time! I was at breakfast with a diminutive artist, name of Hasen. Casually I remarked on the excellence of our Spiegel Eier. He wept. My interest was piqued. [...] "Why do you weep?" [...] I inquired. [...] "Because the Spiegel Eier tastes so good," [...] he simpered. That was all. But it was everything! Here indeed was the understanding heart for which I would have combed the world!... One more date in the saga of our collaboration fell on September 26, 1955. An important executive named Moe Reilly gave Dondi a job. [...] "How's he doing?" [...] you ask. Modesty forces me {{to admit that the}} <b>kid</b> <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> along so well that Hasen and I are now living the life of Reilly. In case you care, this is how we collaborate. I lock myself in a small-type room (you know where). Two days later, I stagger out with a whole roll— er, ream of scribbling. These brain squeezings I then boil down into the written material for six daily strips and a Sunday page. Since I can't typewrite, I prepare two clean longhand copies, one of which I relay to Hasen. He takes it from there (and beautifully!). The other copy goes to editor Moe Reilly. Once a month, Hasen, Moe Reilly and I have food and beverages together to discuss Dondi's future plights. We enjoy these bacchanalian revels very much because the Syndicate pays for them.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the issue}} of child {{prostitution}} <b>is</b> increasingly prevalent. <b>Kids</b> <b>are</b> supposed to <b>get</b> a proper education, so that their behavior is not distorted.

Reports in the media suggested that it was striker Max Clayton, son of former Alex player Paul, and that the club in question was Liverpool who had offered the Cheshire club a sum of around £1 million for the player's services two years ago. Neither Gradi nor Crewe had confirmed who the player is and which Premier League club was involved, the Merseyside club have failed to comment on the issue and the Football League have not received any complaint from the League Two club.|$|R
