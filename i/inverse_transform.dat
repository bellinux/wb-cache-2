25|$|The Box–Muller {{transform}} {{was developed}} as a more computationally efficient alternative to the <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> sampling method.

25|$|<b>Inverse</b> <b>transform</b> {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} inversion sampling, the inverse probability integral transform, the inverse transformation method, Smirnov transform, golden rule) {{is a basic}} method for pseudo-random number sampling, i.e. for generating sample numbers at random from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function.|$|E
25|$|The {{types of}} symmetries that are {{possible}} for a geometric object depend {{on the set of}} geometric transforms available, and on what object properties should remain unchanged after a transform. Because the composition of two transforms is also a transform and every transform has an <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> that undoes it, the set of transforms under which an object is symmetric form a mathematical group, the symmetry group of the object.|$|E
40|$|The Laplace {{transforms}} of {{the transition}} probability density and distribution functions for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process contain the product of two parabolic cylinder functions, namely D_{v}(x) D_{v}(y) and D_{v}(x) D_{v- 1 }(y), respectively. The <b>inverse</b> <b>transforms</b> of these products have as yet not been documented. However, the transition density and distribution functions {{can be obtained by}} alternatively applying Doob's transform to the Kolmogorov equation and casting the problem in terms of Brownian motion. Linking the resulting transition density and distribution functions to their Laplace transforms then specifies the <b>inverse</b> <b>transforms</b> to the aforementioned products of parabolic cylinder functions. These two results, the recurrence relation of the parabolic cylinder function and the properties of the Laplace transform then enable the calculation of <b>inverse</b> <b>transforms</b> also for countless other combinations in the orders of the parabolic cylinder functions such as D_{v}(x) D_{v- 2 }(y), D_{v+ 1 }(x) D_{v- 1 }(y) and D_{v}(x) D_{v- 3 }(y) ...|$|R

25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{is useful for}} sampling from arbitrary distributions. A general method is the <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> sampling method, which uses the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the target random variable. This method is very useful in theoretical work. Since simulations using this method require inverting the CDF of the target variable, alternative methods have been devised for the cases where the cdf is not known in closed form. One such method is rejection sampling.|$|E
25|$|The {{decomposition}} process itself {{is called a}} Fourier transformation. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more specific name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed. Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply {{to more and more}} abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as harmonic analysis. Each transform used for analysis (see list of Fourier-related transforms) has a corresponding <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> {{that can be used for}} synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Like {{some other}} {{transforms}}, wavelet transforms {{can be used}} to transform data, then encode the transformed data, resulting in effective compression. For example, JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard that uses biorthogonal wavelets. This means that although the frame is overcomplete, it is a tight frame (see types of frames of a vector space), and the same frame functions (except for conjugation in the case of complex wavelets) are used for both analysis and synthesis, i.e., in both the forward and <b>inverse</b> <b>transform.</b> For details see wavelet compression.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, some {{applications}} (such as convolution) work {{equally well}} on bit-reversed data, so one can perform forward transforms, processing, and then <b>inverse</b> <b>transforms</b> all without bit reversal to produce final {{results in the}} natural order.|$|R

25|$|For {{the normal}} distribution, {{the lack of}} an {{analytical}} expression for the corresponding quantile function means that other methods (e.g. the Box–Muller transform) may be preferred computationally. It is often the case that, even for simple distributions, the <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> sampling method can be improved on: see, for example, the ziggurat algorithm and rejection sampling. On the other hand, it is possible to approximate the quantile function of the normal distribution extremely accurately using moderate-degree polynomials, and in fact the method of doing this is fast enough that inversion sampling is now the default method for sampling from a normal distribution in the statistical package R.|$|E
500|$|For every {{reflection}} {{corresponding to}} a point q in the reciprocal space, there is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point -q. This opposite reflection {{is known as the}} Friedel mate of the original reflection. This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons f(r) at a position r is always a real number. As noted above, f(r) is the <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> of its Fourier transform F(q); however, such an <b>inverse</b> <b>transform</b> is a complex number in general. To ensure that f(r) is real, the Fourier transform F(q) must be such that the Friedel mates F(−q) and F(q) are complex conjugates of one another. Thus, F(−q) has the same magnitude as F(q) but they have the opposite phase, i.e., φ(q) = −φ(q) ...|$|E
