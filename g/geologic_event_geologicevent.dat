5000|$|The galactic year {{provides}} a conveniently usable unit for depicting cosmic and geological time periods together. By contrast, a [...] "billion-year" [...] scale {{does not allow}} for useful discrimination between <b>geologic</b> <b>events,</b> and a [...] "million-year" [...] scale requires some rather large numbers.|$|R
5|$|The extreme {{steepness}} {{and depth}} of the Black Canyon formed {{as the result of}} several geologic processes acting together. The Gunnison River is primarily responsible for carving the canyon, though several other <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> had to occur in order to form the canyon as it is seen today.|$|R
5000|$|The cave of {{travertine}} Orto di Ballo is a {{very important}} site for Paleontology because this travertine dates back to Pleistocene [...] and also for its interesting geologic and geomorphological characteristics; thanks to the great number of fossils discovered, we can reconstruct the <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> of this area.|$|R
50|$|The Brunhes-Matuyama reversal, {{named after}} Bernard Brunhes and Motonori Matuyama, was a <b>geologic</b> <b>event,</b> {{approximately}} 781,000 years ago, when the Earth's magnetic field last underwent reversal. Estimations vary {{as to the}} abruptness of the reversal: it may have occurred over several thousand years, or much more quickly, perhaps within a human lifetime.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} billion years, erosion exposed {{a number of}} the quartz-filled, banded vesicles—agates—were freed by running water and {{chemical}} disintegration of the lavas, since these vesicles were now harder than the lava rocks that contained them.

50|$|Many of {{the rocks}} formed during the Cambrian, when the region lay {{at the edge of}} a {{continental}} landmass called Laurentia. These rocks include the Cambrian strata. As the Paleozoic era progressed, several intensified <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> occurred, including repeated episodes of faulting, and in turn, orogenies which involved upward lifting of a metamorphic core complex, creating mafic and rhyolitic dikes and sills.|$|R
5000|$|Sequence {{stratigraphy}} is {{a concept}} which challenges the idea of strict lithostratigraphic units by defining units based on events in sedimentary basins such as oceanic regressions and transgressions. These sequences are a combination of chronostratigraphic units, linked by time, and depositional environment linked by the <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> which occurred at that time, regardless of the grain size of the sediments.|$|R
40|$|Large-magnitude {{earthquakes}} occur every year, {{but most}} hit remote and uninhabited regions and thus go unnoticed. Although populated areas are affected infrequently by large earthquakes, {{each time the}} outcomes are devastating in terms of life and property loss. The human and economic costs of natural hazards {{are on the rise}} as population growth pushes into high-risk areas,which leads to increased exposure to potentially disastrous <b>geologic</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} exercise, {{designed for}} an introductory Earth Science course, examines stratigraphy and plate tectonics while considering predictions {{as a way}} to test theories.

50|$|The Black Mountains consist {{primarily}} of Precambrian gneiss and schists formed over {{a billion years}} ago from primordial sea sediments. The mountains themselves were formed roughly 200-400 million years ago during the Alleghenian orogeny, when the collision of two continental plates thrust {{what is now the}} Appalachian Mountains upward to form a large plateau. Weathering and minor <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> in subsequent periods carved out the mountains.|$|R
2500|$|The Khorgo/Horgo cinder cones was {{considered}} to be about 4 ka old, [...] dating on organic material in its sediments has indicated ages of 8 ka. The Global Volcanism Program indicates a date of 2980 BCE ± 150 years. Some geologists have correlated the activity of Paektusan, Udokan Plateau and Wudalianchi volcanoes elsewhere in Asia and have presumed that common <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> did influence the activity of all three centres.|$|R
40|$|Three field guides are {{available}} to sites of geologic interest on Oahu. One is {{a visit to a}} landslide occurring in a neighborhood; another focuses on developing observational skills and determining the sequence of <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> evident in a stratigraphic section; a third examines features associated with formation of a volcanic tuff ring. The worksheets are designed for teachers to implement as-is or modify for their classes. Educational levels: Middle school...|$|R
50|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Australian continental mass is extremely prolonged and involved, continuing from the Archaean to the recent. In a gross pattern, continental Australia grew from west to east, with Archean rocks mostly in the west, Proterozoic rocks in the centre, and Phanerozoic rocks in the east. Recent <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> are confined to intraplate earthquakes, as the continent of Australia sits distant from the plate boundary.|$|R
50|$|The goal is {{to provide}} models of {{time-dependent}} strain associated {{with a number of}} recent earthquakes and other <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> as constrained by GPS data. With the use of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), a remote-sensing technique, and PBO (Plate Boundary Observatory), a fixed array of GPS receivers and strainmeters, the EarthScope project will provide spatially continuous strain measurements over wide geographic areas with decimeter to centimeter resolution.|$|R

50|$|A marine {{transgression}} is a <b>geologic</b> <b>event</b> during which sea level rises {{relative to the}} land and the shoreline moves toward higher ground, resulting in flooding. Transgressions can be caused either by the land sinking or the ocean basins filling with water (or decreasing in capacity). Transgressions and regressions may be caused by tectonic events such as orogenies, severe climate change such as ice ages or isostatic adjustments following removal of ice or sediment load.|$|R

Users can access a simplified geologic time scale that provides links to <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> in the North Cascades region. These include the deposition of various terranes, periods of intrusion and metamorphism, {{the beginning of the}} Cascade volcanic arc, and periods of major glaciation. Links to related materials are also provided. Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R
30|$|After {{learning}} about <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> {{in the ten}} class sessions, students were tested on this material on the third examination in the course, which did not contain material from the first two sections, in the 11 th class session. The three multiple choice items used in Experiment 1 {{were added to the}} regular examination, as well as 12 multiple choice items and four line estimation items to assess magnitude representation and reasoning (see Measures section below).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{settlement on}} Umnak Island is at Anangula and is 8,400 years old. Anangula was later abandoned and the Sandy Beach site became occupied, along with Idaliuk and Chaluka. Most {{of the early}} settlements on Umnak were located along the streams. A major <b>geologic</b> <b>event</b> was the cutting of strand flats during the Hypsithermal period, about 8250 to 3000 years ago, {{which led to a}} greater natural food supply on the island for the settlers.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{scientific}} community currently considers creationism to be pseudoscience. [...] "By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'" [...] Scientists say the museum rejects modern science because of the museum's preconceived religious views, and misleads visitors by extrapolating very special <b>geologic</b> <b>events</b> into equivalence with much longer-term events.|$|R
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various <b>geologic</b> <b>events.</b> Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|R
