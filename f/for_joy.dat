25|$|A partial {{exception}} was Jump <b>for</b> <b>Joy,</b> a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941, at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Hollywood luminaries such as actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney {{invested in the}} production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered to direct. At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character {{in the second half}} of the show.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} carrion diet, the Celtic peoples {{strongly}} associated corvids with war, {{death and the}} battlefield – their great intelligence meant that they were often considered messengers, or manifestations of the gods such Bendigeidfran Blessed raven or the Irish Morrigan, underworld deities that {{may be related to}} the later Arthurian Fisher King. The Welsh Dream of Rhonabwy illustrates well the association of ravens with war. In many parts of Britain, gatherings of crows, or more often magpies, are counted using the divination rhyme: one for sorrow, two <b>for</b> <b>joy,</b> three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. Cornish superstition holds that when a lone magpie is encountered, it must be loudly greeted with respect.|$|E
25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary <b>for</b> <b>joy</b> and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

500|$|Critics warmly praised Passport to Pimlico on its release. Several critics {{identified}} that the script was excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that [...] "the chief credit <b>for...</b> <b>joy</b> {{of a film}} should go to T.

500|$|Johann Sebastian Bach {{composed}} the church cantata [...] ("Exult in God in every land" [...] or [...] "Shout <b>for</b> <b>joy</b> to God in all lands") , in Leipzig. The work is Bach's only church cantata scored for a solo soprano and trumpet. He composed it for general use (ogni tempo), {{in other words}} not for a particular date in the church calendar, although he used it for the 15th Sunday after Trinity: the first known performance was on 17 September 1730 in Leipzig. The work may have been composed earlier, possibly for an occasion at the court of Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, for whom Bach had {{composed the}} Hunting Cantata and the Shepherd Cantata.|$|E

500|$|When Cisneros {{addresses}} {{the subject of}} female sexuality, she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality, and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture. However, Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms, especially in her poetry. This is true, for example, of her 1987 volume of poetry My Wicked, Wicked Ways. According to Madsen, Cisneros refers to herself as [...] "wicked" [...] for having [...] "reappropriated, taken control of, her own sexuality and the articulation of it– a power forbidden to women under patriarchy". Through these poems she aims to represent [...] "the reality of female sexuality" [...] so that women readers will recognize the [...] "divisive effects" [...] of the stereotypes that {{they are expected to}} conform to, and [...] "discover the potential <b>for</b> <b>joy</b> in their bodies that is denied them".|$|E
500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{wrote in}} Slate that {{official}} {{reaction in the}} Westparticularly the United Stateswas too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark {{and the right to}} free speech. He said, [...] "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream <b>for</b> <b>joy</b> as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' feelings." [...] William Kristol also wrote that the response of Western leaders, {{with the exception of the}} Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by [...] "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" [...] to fight back against the [...] "assault" [...] on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Holloway {{joined the}} Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After {{playing at the}} Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the {{production}} to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. [...] Holloway said of the experience: [...] "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age." [...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping <b>for</b> <b>Joy.</b> [...] American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.|$|E
