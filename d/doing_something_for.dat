500|$|... "Bangla Desh" [...] {{marked the}} first {{occasion}} that Harrison worked with Horn, who {{would go on to}} become a regular collaborator. Already a veteran of the LA music scene by 1971, Horn recalls his [...] "jaded" [...] mindset before meeting Harrison, but describes the session as a [...] "real turning point" [...] in his career, [...] "because we were <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> a cause". It was also the first time that Keltner played on a George Harrison session, the two musicians having already worked together on Lennon's Imagine album (1971). The [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] session {{was the beginning of a}} lifelong friendship, with the pair remaining [...] "as brothers", Keltner has said, until Harrison's death in 2001. Together with Clapton, Preston, Bob Dylan and the group Badfinger, all these musicians joined Harrison and Shankar on stage at Madison Square Garden.|$|E

Culture depends on reciprocity: if I <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> you, you should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> me in return. Reciprocity is also important in liking. Having someone like you is powerful at a deep, gut level: {{it is hard to}} resist liking that person in return...|$|R

500|$|All data {{gathering}} involves difficulties {{with the potential}} inaccuracy of research subjects' reports. For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor {{have no reason to}} pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is. For all the ones that think it's all about some ruff shit, talkin' about guns all the time, but no science behind it, we gonna bring it to them like this." [...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big." [...] During the sessions, Nas composed the song [...] "Nas Is Like", which he later recorded as a single for his 1999 album I Am….|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going to have to be traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Lucas {{recruited}} many conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, {{who worked}} on [...] (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props and scenery. McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss {{his plans for the}} then-untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make. Two years later, after completing American Graffiti, Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested [...] "in <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> Star Wars."
