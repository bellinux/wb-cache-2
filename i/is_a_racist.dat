500|$|Stamps, Arkansas, as {{depicted}} in Caged Bird, has very little [...] "social ambiguity": it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>racist</b> world divided between Black and white, male and female. [...] Als characterizes the division as [...] "good and evil", and notes how Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, which was directed at Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood. Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem, as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies. Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression. The caged bird metaphor also invokes the [...] "supposed contradiction of the bird singing {{in the midst of}} its struggle". Scholar Ernece B. Kelley calls Caged Bird a [...] "gentle indictment of white American womanhood"; Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is [...] "a dismaying story of white dominance".|$|E

Many in Africa believe that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>racist</b> aspect to European and American criticism of Mugabe. Millions of blacks died in Angola, the Republic of Congo and Rwanda. A few whites lost their lives in Zimbabwe, unfortunately, and already the West is bent out of shape." ...|$|E

Former Temple member Tim Carter describes {{the reason for the}} move to Jonestown as [...] "in seventy four (1974), what we saw in the United States was creeping fascism."

Having considered the various arguments advanced by Irving to assail the effect of the convergent evidence relied upon by the Defendants, it is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews," [...] and [...] "it follows that it is my conclusion that Irving's denials of these propositions were contrary to the evidence."

2500|$|In a July 2005 {{statement}} on his website, Vikernes explained {{that although he}} [...] "occasionally used the term 'nazism' to describe [...] ideological foundation", he no longer describes himself as such: [...] "The reason I have been drawn to and occasionally have expressed support for 'nazism' is mainly {{because many of the}} Norwegian (and German) 'nazis' embraced our Pagan religion as our blood-religion and they rejected Judeo-Christianity as Jewish heresy". He identifies three things which distinguish him from the [...] "Nazis": [...] "unlike them I am not socialistic (not even on a national level), I am not materialistic and I believe in (the ancient Scandinavian!) democracy". He expressed a desire to not be associated with anti-Slavic sentiments. He also states that though he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>racist</b> {{in the sense that he}} acknowledges physical and mental differences between the races, he hates no one and in general states that [...] "hatred is irrational".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{portrayal}} of this character <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>racist</b> caricature. Comedian Hari Kondabolu noted the negative reaction to Apu in the Indian American community in a Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell web exclusive segment. Comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character and recalled that early in his career, he was asked to do the [...] "Apu accent" [...] as a stereotypical version of the [...] "Indian accent" [...] (although Nanjiani is Pakistani, not Indian). In a 2007 interview, Azaria acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: [...] "Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with the Huffington Post, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would [...] "suddenly change now" [...] or that the character would be written out, saying, [...] "I'd be surprised if [...] write him any less frequently because he's offensive." [...] As of 2016, Kondabolu is set to produce a feature-length documentary entitled The Problem with Apu, on the subject of [...] "how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into {{the hearts and minds of}} Americans and continues to exist —intact— twenty-six years later." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now Fundamental Rights Agency), then {{an agency}} of the European Union, {{developed}} a more detailed working definition, which states: [...] "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." [...] It also adds that [...] "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," [...] but that [...] "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." [...] It provides contemporary examples {{of ways in which}} antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>racist</b> endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel. Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency. A spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition. However, despite its disappearance from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the definition has gained widespread international use. The definition has been adopted by the European Parliament Working Group on Antisemitism, in 2010 it was adopted by the United States Department of State, in 2014 it was adopted in the Operational Hate Crime Guidance of the UK College of Policing and was also adopted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, and in 2016 it was adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, making it the most widely adopted definition of antisemitism around the world.|$|E
