After discussing his findings with Sara over dinner, Tsukuru decides he has to know {{the rest of the}} story. To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> never did with Tsukuru.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Lloyd {{was booked}} by the Orpheum Syndicate {{to appear at}} the New York Palace Theatre. She and Dillon set sail on the RMS Olympic under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided {{in the country for}} many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the {{authorities}} found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of moral turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry took place. [...] Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. [...] After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. [...] Alice later stated that [...] "the indignity of the subsequent experience [...] went to Marie's heart <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> never survived. [...] She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still {{relatively}} unknown Paige {{the title role}} of Eva Perón {{in the first stage}} production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Evita. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, [...] "Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> didn't have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But I saw this as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, I grabbed with both hands. I wanted the role more than anything else in the whole world." [...] For her performance in Evita, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award. She also won the Variety Club Award for Showbusiness Personality of the Year. She played the role for 20 months in total, from 1978 to 1980. She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled Sitting Pretty. Just prior to her success in Evita, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work. She admitted that she was [...] "fed up with the whole thing" [...] and that she could not even afford new clothing or to eat out; [...] "Evita saved me" [...] she stated.|$|E

500|$|New {{cast members}} include Ian McShane, {{who plays the}} notorious pirate and primary {{antagonist}} of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest. According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because [...] "he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well" [...] and the actor accepted the job due to both the [...] "very funny and charming" [...] script {{and the opportunity to}} work with Marshall. The beard took one {{hour and a half to}} get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to [...] "a real biker pirate—it's all black leather.” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as [...] "an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful", and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine. The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow, and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip, and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast. Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and Juan Carlos Vellido. Jaenada was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} returned on-screen on 1 April 2008, {{but made}} her first appearance {{back in the}} soap's setting of Albert Square the following week, drawing 10.4million viewers and 42.6% of the total TV viewing audience. In the storyline, Bianca had fallen on hard times, and after being evicted from her flat her children were taken into custody, so Bianca returned to Walford to seek help from her grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). In the documentary EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca, which aired to celebrate the character's return, the changes in Bianca's character were noted: [...] "The carefree, wild child of yesterday, {{has been replaced by}} the wore-torn and downtrodden single mum of four. Bianca has done what she always wanted to avoid, repeating the mistakes that her mother Carol had made." [...] EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown has commented, [...] "Bianca's still the same Bianca <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> still speaks before she thinks, comes out fists flying. She's got that family of misfit kids with different fathers [...] She's like Carol." [...] The BBC described the character's comeback as a [...] "big hit". However, James Walton from The Telegraph accused the Jackson family of being melodramatic and [...] "boring", adding [...] "Perhaps the storyline is meant to be an updated version of [...] Cathy Come Home – yet if so, the writers have forgotten one important thing. We’re supposed to be rooting for the mother rather than for Social Services." ...|$|E
