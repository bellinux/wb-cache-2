[...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

6000|$|... "So 'e--was," [...] {{answered}} the perplexed lady, looking round the room; [...] "didn't <b>I</b> <b>'ear</b> <b>'im</b> a-shakin' 'ands wi' you, an' a-shoutin' for 'am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, before I {{knew what}} had happened, <b>I</b> <b>hears</b> <b>him</b> go, smack! <b>I</b> rushes {{to the window and}} looks out: I see him on the pavement, sitting up like.|$|R
6000|$|... "He deserves it," [...] {{said the}} skipper warmly. [...] "He’s always run straight, ’as Bill Simmons, and when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>’im</b> being talked at like that, {{it makes me}} go ’ot all over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't {{wonder at}} it," [...] I replied; [...] "but I believe Bingo is still alive; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{scratching}} himself." ...|$|E
60|$|The minutes pass; {{the half-hour}} longer strikes from {{the clock on}} the chimney-piece; and at last <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him!</b> He knocks softly, and opens the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him,</b> {{and shake}} hands with him; and we talk, and walk, and dine, and so on; but I don't believe it. Nothing is real.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> holding Garm's nose {{as the dog}} {{threw it}} up to the stars.|$|R
60|$|Bessie (Sobs, {{drooping}} {{against the}} railings). No! No! I don't. <b>I</b> don't <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> any more.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} see him any more, though <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> choking and {{strangling}} and coughing. The audience kept a death-like silence. I crouched {{on the lip of}} the entrance and waited. The strangling and coughing died down, and <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> now and again clearing his throat. A little later he began to climb down. He went very quietly, pausing every moment or so to stretch his neck or to feel it with his hand.|$|R
6000|$|Flo. Well; {{make the}} {{experiment}} however: <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> coming, {{and a whole}} noise of fidlers at his heels. Hey-day, what a mad husband shall I have!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay,' said Alfred, 'when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{whooping}} {{about like}} mad, and jumping and leaping, {{and going on}} like I used to do, and never shall again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|My coachman, in the {{moonlight}} there, [...] Looks through the side-light of the door; <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> with his brethren swear, [...] As I could do,--but only more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{can you say}} so? <b>I</b> should <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> if he were there,' said Baptista, {{sufficiently}} recovered {{to argue}} down an apparent untruth.|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I. I'm {{afraid he}} is going to ignore my summons. Unless <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>him</b> to-morrow <b>I</b> shall {{consider}} him craven or indifferent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lady, you labor {{under some}} mistake; Treherne {{is by no}} means a gambler. I owe him no goodwill, but <b>I</b> cannot <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> slandered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No more did I,' said Robina, 'but he does cough; <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{through the}} wall in the morning. Do you think there is {{anything}} in it, Lance?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't say nothin' to me,' replied Sam, 'for I can't bear it. He's {{close to}} the door. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> a-knockin' his head again the lath and plaster now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> {{swear that}} he will keep it, [...] In memory of that blessed day, [...] To smile on it or over-weep it [...] When she and spring are far away.|$|E
60|$|I {{clung to}} him and begged and pleaded, {{but he was not}} moved. He made me sit down again, and told me <b>I</b> must <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> out.|$|R
6000|$|That evening, as I sat in {{the saloon}} after dinner, <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> muttering {{continuously}} in his room. Ransome, who was clearing the table, said to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're a'most on {{the road}} now, Gertie; honest we are. <b>I</b> can't <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> now. <b>I</b> ain't afraid of him--he wouldn't dast hurt us or my pa would fix him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cecil {{had tears}} in her eyes as she said, [...] "I don't know! When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> sighing in his sleep, I long to give it up and tell him I will try to be happy here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] Amos replied; [...] "and I won't till <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> say so himself. I {{want to see}} him go to Des Moines, but I {{want to see him}} go as a Republican." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the voice}} of Tommy Tit the Chickadee, {{and it must be}} that his wife is with him, for <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> calling 'Phoebe! Phoebe!' How lovely of them to come down to see me so soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] Forrest answered, [...] "and {{the sooner}} <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>him</b> the better. If {{you are really}} the owner of this house, I shall leave to-morrow morning." ...|$|R

60|$|Fred's {{door was}} shut, and <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> snoring. <b>I</b> {{scratched}} gently, and then harder, till I heard the snores stop. He {{got out of}} bed and opened the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are all the}} same, {{as people}} tell us now," [...] she said, smiling. [...] "Any way, he {{looks as if he}} was a waif from the heroic age. But, my dear, did not <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> call you Lucy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Blow it out--hard--that's it! Well now, sir, do {{you come}} and begin upon mine, as you must be hungry. I'll finish the griddling. Ought we to mind the man sitting down in our company, as there's no other room for him? <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> coming in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To bed!' said Mr Pecksniff. 'Bed! 'Tis {{the voice}} of the sluggard, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> complain, you have woke me too soon, I must slumber again. If any young orphan will repeat the {{remainder}} of that simple piece from Doctor Watts's collection, an eligible opportunity now offers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, good, excellent--for the interior." [...] The little Mexican {{retreated into}} his shack and <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> murmuring, [...] "For the interior, excellent," [...] {{as he moved}} to and fro.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed the other, {{brightening}} {{for a brief}} moment; [...] "yes, <b>I</b> did <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> He said we {{were going}} six knots. Now I do not understand what that means." ...|$|R
