5|$|At {{least in}} North America, Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{distinctive}} and easily recognizable. Two {{other species of}} Calostoma also occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has a reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E
