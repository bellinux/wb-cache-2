[...] and that [...] "Today's {{violence}} is again an indication of a criminal regime that has lost any common sense. When the regime tries to counter a peaceful demonstration by using thugs... there are few words that do justice to this villainy and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> only hasten that regime's departure." [...] A coalition of opposition parties agreed to hold talks with the newly formed government. However, ElBaradei and the Muslim Brotherhood stressed they would not talk to any government representative, including Vice President Omar Suleiman, until Mubarak's resignation.|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be very valued in that regard. I always {{thought of it as}} a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
500|$|The 1970 {{demo version}} of [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] appears briefly in Martin Scorsese's [...] {{documentary}} (2011), playing over {{a scene where}} Harrison takes to the stage {{for one of his}} 1974 Dark Horse Tour concerts, before cutting to him and his wife on an empty beach at sunset. Although available since the 1990s on bootleg collections such as Beware of ABKCO!, this solo demo was only issued officially in the UK in November 2011, with the [...] DVD release of the film. Six months later, it received worldwide release on the [...] compilation. Noting Harrison's usual practice of perfecting his guitar parts, compilation producer Giles Martin commented: [...] "While that's a very valid practice, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> sometimes inhibit the spirit of the recording... he appeal of this version to me is that it's very rough and edgy." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Woody Harrelson was {{attached}} to the film to play Ron Woodroof, but left the film because of financing issues. In 2002, Brad Pitt {{was attached}} to play the lead role. In June 2008, Ryan Gosling was in talks to join the film for the lead role to play Woodroof, but couldn't take the role. In 2009, producer Brenner sent the script to actor Matthew McConaughey and got him involved to star in the film. Wondering whether the Texas native was interested in playing another Texas native (he's originally from Uvalde), Brenner says that he asked himself: Who is Ron Woodroof?' And in my mind, it was Matthew. Like Ron, he's from Dallas, he's handsome, and he has a twinkle in the eye. Matthew also has intensity and intelligence like Ron did, mixed with that cowboy charisma and fighter's spirit. He was beyond perfect for the role." [...] Writer Borten said: [...] "Ron was a very charismatic, funny and persuasive, a real salesman. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming. Matthew possesses a lot of those same qualities." [...] On March 9, 2011, Los Angeles Times confirmed that McConaughey would star in the film as Woodroof and quoted McConaughey as saying: [...] "It's a great script and a great story. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be a great movie." [...] Woodroof's sister Sharon Woodroof Braden was reportedly pleased with the casting of McConaughey as Woodroof because he had a similar swagger and personality. She had shown concern earlier in the development process when Pitt and Gosling were attached, due to their personalities not matching Woodroof's.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

The album also emphasized the distance Morrison had moved away from R and was inspired by Irish music. He commented at the time, [...] "It's important for people to get into the music of their own culture... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be dangerous to not validate the music of where you're from, for anybody, whether it's Bulgaria or whatever." ...|$|E
