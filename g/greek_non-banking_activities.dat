A first interesting result is that bank and non-bank development are affected differently by the determinants under consideration. For example, growth does not promote banking activity; it promotes development of stock market liquidity. While we find that better institutions, in general, have a positive and significant effect on financial development, some institutional aspects matter more than others do. We also present evidence on the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as investment, inflation, savings, trade openness and financial liberalization, as key determinants of financial development in the MENA region, further reflecting a sharp contrast between bank and <b>non-bank</b> <b>activity.</b> Our results are robust to different specifications and different estimation techniques...|$|R

The research also identified poor corporate governance, inadequate risk management systems, ill planned expansion drives, chronic liquidity challenges, foreign currency shortages and diversion from core business to speculative <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities</b> as other factors that caused the crisis.

40|$|This paper investigates whether more {{favorable}} stock recommendations and higher credit ratings {{serve as a}} reputational asset or reputational liability around reputation-damaging events. Analyzing the reputational effects of operational risk announcements incurred by financial institutions, we find that firms with a “Buy” stock recommendation or “Speculative Grade” credit rating {{are more likely to}} incur an equity-based reputational damage. In addition, firms with lower credit ratings incur a much more severe debt-based reputational damage. Moreover, credit ratings are more instrumental in mitigating the debt-based reputational damage caused by fraud incidents or incurred in <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, the misconduct of senior management could demolish the reputation of firms with less heterogeneous stock recommendations. Finally, credit ratings serve as an equity-based reputational asset in the short term but turn into an equity-based reputational liability in the long term. Overall, our analysis reveals that stock recommendations represent a reputational burden and credit ratings act as a reputational shield; however, the persistence and magnitude of such reputational effects are moderated by time and event characteristics...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 28). Internship {{is an integral part}} of BBA program. The objective of this program is to expose the students to organizational work environment. I got an opportunity to go through such a program. I was assigned to work as an intern in Janata Bank Limited- Mohammadpur Corporate Branch. The report is on “An enquiry into the financial feasibility of Janata Bank Limited, Mohammadpur Corporate Office”. The 1 st part of this report is concerned with my overall experience with this branch. The 2 nd part stands for the analysis. My focus was to answer how the branch is generating as well as increasing profit. Being a bank, it is supposed to do so by concentrating on banking <b>activities.</b> <b>Non-banking</b> <b>activities</b> are not considered to be avoided but the bank should not pay more attention to it than its core banking activities. The data represents year 2012, 2013 and 2014. Initially in 2012, total income consisted of more portion generated by banking activities. It was 53 %. After that, the total income has been made more from profit generated by <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities.</b> In my analysis part, I have taken the weighted average interest receivables on loans and weighted average interest payables on deposits. It is evident that, this branch takes on more deposits than it gives loans. For example, in the last year, total deposits taken were Tk. 235. 21. 66, 971 and total loans made were only Tk. 61, 82, 09, 510. However, the interest spreads were positive. Interests paid on deposits hold the largest portion of expenses. In my analysis, Midterm loans hold the highest portion for interest receivables (58 %- 92 %). Similarly, Weighted Average Interest payables for Midterm deposits are the largest. Midterm deposits have greater weights every year. After all the analysis, it can be said that, this branch is profitable but since 2012, it has been increasing it’s profit through non banking activities. It has been more focused on the wholesale funding. The reasons behind such attempt could be lacking of creditworthy client, interest in easy money making without default risk etc. Erham Ebne Abdur RahmanB. Business Administratio...|$|R

30|$|However, our key {{indicator}} {{for the future}} is the trajectory of the “Quaternary” measured by profitability. While the trend in profitability had been upward, 2013 saw a decline in bank profitability. South Korean banks reported $ 8.2 bn in combined net profits in 2012, a drop of 23.2 % from 2011, as their net interest margin – a key measure of banks’ profitability – fell to 2.1 %, its lowest level of the past decade apart from the crisis years of 2007 – 9. The country’s banks face squeezing margins due to their heavy reliance on interest income, while their non-interest income remains small. To compensate, they are under increasing pressure to expand into <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities</b> like insurance (KB Financial Group) and derivatives (e.g. Woori Finance) rather unsuccessfully. South Korean banks remain weak in investment banking, which requires thorough risk control. Consumer credit offers little room for growth, given the already high levels of debt among Korean households. Also, penetrating foreign markets has been a difficult, due to their lack of brand value and international networks (Jung-a, 2013). Moreover, the profitability of the four main Seoul-based companies, Shinhan Financial Group Co. Ltd., Hana Financial Group Inc., KB Financial Group Inc. and Woori Bank dropped for two consecutive years from 2013. Their combined profit declined by half, to 4.78 trillion won (US$ 4 billion) at the end of 2013 from 9.19 trillion won (US$ 8 billion) 2 years earlier.|$|R

Strategic lending by Chuan via Bank of Ayudhya was critical to the development of Thai capital during Thailand’s early industrialisation and helped to build many of modern Thailand’s major business groups. [...] Under Chuan, Bank of Ayudhya became one of Thailand’s top three banks. Its success was in very large part due to Chuan’s leadership. Comparing Khun Chin, the head of Bangkok Bank to Khun Chuan, the head of Sasin Business School commented: “What Khun Chin could do, Khun Chuan could do later. That is how he built Bank of Ayudhya”. The bank also benefitted from an astute lending policy which meant that the average number of bad loans was significantly below the average loan loss across the Thai banking sector.|$|R

40|$|The Financial Services Modernization Act, {{also known}} as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), of 1999 has {{permitted}} U. S. bank holding companies (BHCs) to operate in <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities</b> that are financial in nature. This dissertation addresses the impact of this across-activity diversification within the U. S. financial services industry on the profitability and the risk-adjusted performance of bank holding companies. Using a variety of diversification measures, the study analyzes the relationship between corporate diversification and the financial performance of BHCs pre- and post-GLBA, from 1990 to 2011. The analysis of the profitability-diversification relationship provides evidence that the negative impact of revenue diversification on the profitability of banking firms that exists in the literature is mainly due to measurement and model specification issues. Failure to differentiate between interest-versus-noninterest and banking-versus-nonbanking types of revenue diversification has resulted in using measures of the first type of diversification to study the second, leading to inaccurate results. Moreover, introducing nonlinearity to the relationship between revenue diversification and profitability provides evidence that this relationship is negative only at relatively low levels of diversification but positive if the level of diversification is sufficiently high. Controlling for these measurement and model specification issues results in profitability premium, rather than discount, that is associated with higher levels of revenue diversification. The study also employs an event study methodology to measure how stock markets respond to mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 As) in which BHCs acquire other banking and nonbanking financial targets. The cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) to acquirers and targets show that M 2 ̆ 6 A that are either non-diversifying or diversifying within closely-related credit intermediation activities increase the value of merged firms. The effect of M 2 ̆ 6 As that combine less-related financial activities on firm value is either negative or insignificant. This implies that market participants have better expectations of the future performance of less diversified firms in managing the risk-return trade-off. Comparing the average CARs of the pre- and post-GLBA eras supports this conclusion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the study of the {{complexity}} of entities in the US banking sector. To this end, three lines of research are pursued in this thesis. We start with an investigation analysing the importance of strategic fit for post-M&A performance, {{which is one of the}} necessary prior steps for a financial institution to become complex. Second, we extend our investigation to analyse the effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act. 2010 to control the risk and non-traditional banking activities of complex bank holding companies. This law is considered one of the main avenues for the US government to control the continuously growing complexity of financial institutions. Lastly, we explore the influence of the complexity of banks on the composition of their board according to the degree of busyness of board members in terms of sitting on other boards. Using different econometric approaches and different samples, we present robust evidence for several findings. Firstly, strategic fit plays a key role as a performance enhancing factor for banks that decide to expand their market and/or diversify their products portfolio through pursuing merger deals. The subsequent analysis finds that the Dodd-Frank Act. 2010 has distinct effects on the risk and <b>non-banking</b> <b>activities</b> among the different types of complex BHCs. Moreover, we present differences between large and consolidated BHCs in their “shadow” banking activities following the enactment of this law. Furthermore, we observe that banks continue increasing their proportions of independent directors. However, banks require independent board members with fewer commitments from outside boards. Lastly, the busyness degree of the executive board members is related to the organisational complexity between banks and their subsidiaries. The empirical results give rise to numerous important policy implications. The supervision of a proper degree of strategic fit in key aspects between merging entities before a merger approval might increase the probability to achieve positive post-mergers outputs and reduce early bailouts that affect local economies. Furthermore, the recent re-regulatory changes have achieve to partially increase the stability of BHCs in which policy makers should consider the nature of complexity to have a better control of their risk, especially placing limits on their risky non-traditional banking activities. Finally, it has highlighted the importance of laws, related to the appointment of the board members, to take into account the individual complexity of each banking institution. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Investment Banking is an American synonym of Merchant Banking. Merchant Banking {{originated}} in the 13 th century in the European countries. As far as {{the origin of this}} term is concerned, it is told that earlier Merchants used to attend to extending of loans and arranging finance for trade but as the time passed the subject of banking assumed more importance and the Merchants switched over to banking activities,hence the term Merchant Banking. Rapid industrialization in India has led to the setting up of new industrial units and Expansion,Diversification, and Modernization of existing units. The need for having expert advice and the guidance of Specialists in the field has therefore become Imperative. Only Merchant Banking can offer these services.
