5000|$|Since {{the first}} census in 1790, the decennial count {{has been the}} basis for the United States {{representative}} form of government. Article <b>I,</b> <b>Section</b> <b>II</b> specifies that [...] "The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative." [...] In 1790, each member of the House represented about 34,000 residents. Since then, the House more than quadrupled in size, and in 1911 the number of representatives was fixed at 435. Today, each member represents about 20 times as many constituents.|$|E

5000|$|The United States Constitution (Article <b>I,</b> <b>Section</b> <b>II)</b> {{requires}} an enumeration {{of the population}} every ten years and “in such Manner as they Congress shall by Law direct.” From the first census in 1790, legislators understood that the census should collect basic demographic information beyond {{the number of people}} in the household. James Madison first proposed including questions in the census to “enable them to adapt the public measures to the particular circumstances of the community.” Such knowledge collected with each census, he said, “would give them an opportunity of marking the progress of the society." [...] The number and type of questions included in censuses since 1790 have reflected current American societal trends and the growing nation’s expanded data needs.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier {{apportionment}} {{bill was}} vetoed by President George Washington on April 5, 1792 as unconstitutional, marking the {{first use of}} the U.S. President's veto power. Washington made two objections {{in a letter to}} the House describing the reason for his veto. The first objection made in the letter was that the bill did not have a uniform ratio to reach the numbers of representatives to population set forth in the bill. Secondly, the bill [...] "allotted to eight of the States more than one for every thirty thousand" [...] as delimited by Article <b>I</b> <b>Section</b> <b>II</b> of the United States Constitution. The next day, the House attempted to override the President's veto but failed to reach the two thirds vote required and on April 10 efforts began to revise the bill a third time.|$|E

This was repealed by Article <b>I,</b> <b>Section</b> <b>II.</b> of the 1792 Constitution: [...] "No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, under this State". The 1778 Constitution of the State of South Carolina stated, [...] "No person shall be eligible {{to sit in the}} house of representatives unless he be of the Protestant religion", the 1777 Constitution of the State of Georgia (art.

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of the microwave induced zero resistance states (MIZRS) and the microwave induced resistance oscillations (MIRO) {{were discovered in}} the ultraclean two-dimensional electron systems in 2001 [...] 2003 and have attracted great interest of researchers. In spite of numerous theoretical efforts the true origin of these effects remains unknown so far.

The proposed analytical theory is in agreement with all experimental facts accumulated so far and provides a simple and self-evident explanation of the microwave frequency, polarization, magnetic field, mobility, power and temperature dependencies of the observed effects.
