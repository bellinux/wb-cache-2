In short, market participants are currently considering the use of <b>free</b> <b>data</b> as a form of basic reimbursement for data consumed in the process of an end-user consumer viewing a mobile ad that consumes bandwidth paid for by that end-user consumer. Similarly, the provisioning of <b>free</b> <b>data</b> may also {{take the form of a}} [...] "data reward" [...] for viewing said mobile ads, where the <b>free</b> <b>data</b> provided to the end-user is in excess to the amount consumed as a result of the ad itself (in effect granting the end-user consumer a [...] "data surplus" [...] that may be used for other non-ad related purposes).|$|E

40|$|Phase {{modifications}} in a partially miscible blend PS/ PMMA and an immiscible blend PVC/EVA {{have been brought}} about using electron beam and microwave irradiation to improve the interfacial tension. These changes have been characterized by positron lifetime technique through free volume monitoring with support from DSC measurements. The hydrodynamic interaction parameter deduced from <b>free</b> volume <b>data</b> {{turns out to be}} a good parameter to characterize the interfacial changes compared with <b>free</b> volume <b>data</b> itself. The <b>free</b> volume <b>data</b> also confirms that the conventional DSC measurements are not adequate to differentiate the level of miscibility or interfacial tension. Present data based on hydrodynamic interaction parameter indicate that microwave irradiation is a better route to stabilize the interfaces than e-beam irradiation...|$|R
