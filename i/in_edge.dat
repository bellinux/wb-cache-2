Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow.

40|$|Thermoregulation {{is thought}} to be the most {{important}} factor influencing habitat selection by terrestrial ectotherms, at least in temperate climates. The cost-benefit model of thermoregulation predicts that ectotherms should invest more in thermoreg-ulation when the costs of doing so are low (when the thermal quality of the habitat is high). However, the extent to which ectotherms vary their thermoregulatory behaviour according to the thermal quality of habitats is currently unknown. We studied the relationship between habitat use and thermoregulation in 53 black rat snakes using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. Among the habitats available to black rat snakes, edges had the highest thermal quality, retreat sites and forest were intermediate, and open habitats had the lowest thermal quality. Black rat snakes experienced more favourable body temperatures while in barns (retreat sites) than <b>in</b> <b>edges,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>edges</b> than <b>in</b> forest. During the day, the effectiveness and the extent of thermoregulation by the snakes were equal in barns and forest, but much lower <b>in</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>In</b> fact, black rat snakes selected thermally favourable microhabitats less than their availability while <b>in</b> <b>edges.</b> Therefore, more favourable body temperatures wer...|$|R

After failing to regain the title at Armageddon, Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble, but was last eliminated by Randy Orton.

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles <b>in</b> <b>Edge</b> of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.

5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting <b>in</b> <b>Edge</b> to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Steganography is covert communication, {{which means}} {{to hide the}} very {{existence}} of a message from a third party. Due to growing need for security of data, image steganography is gaining popularity. The traditional image steganography algorithm is Least Significant Bit embedding, but it can be easily detected by the attackers as it embeds data sequentially in all pixels. Instead of sequentially embedding data, data can be embedded in random pixels, but it causes speckles in the image. A better approach is to hide the data in the regions like edges. An attacker has less suspicion of the presence of data bits <b>in</b> <b>edges,</b> because pixels <b>in</b> <b>edges</b> appear to be either much brighter or dimmer than their neighbors. So we present a novel technique to hide data <b>in</b> the <b>edges</b> of the image by extending the Least Significant Bit embedding algorithm. This algorithm hides data <b>in</b> the <b>edge</b> pixels and thus ensures better security against attackers...|$|R
25|$|On the August 10 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, the Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy) {{attacked}} the WWF Tag Team Champions, Edge and Christian, after their championship match against the Dudley Boyz. As the Hardy Boyz attacked Edge with a ladder, the Dudley Boyz powerbombed Christian through a table; this began a three-way feud, the third main rivalry heading into SummerSlam. The feud intensified on the August 14 edition of Raw is War, when Edge and Christian attacked Matt Hardy with steel chairs after the Hardy Boyz' match against Right to Censor. Later that night, Commissioner Mick Foley announced a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match {{between the three}} teams in a WrestleMania 2000 rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship.

500|$|In {{the primary}} {{continuity}} of the comic books comprising the Marvel Universe, college-student Gwen Stacy was the girlfriend of Peter Parker, whom she was unaware was also Spider-Man. This primary version of Gwen Stacy was killed in The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (June 1973). The concept of an alternate-universe, spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first conceptualized by longtime Spider-Man writer Dan Slott for the [...] "Spider-Verse" [...] story arc across multiple series. Slott had suggested [...] "Gwen Stacy as a Spider-Woman" [...] to Spider-Man editor Nick Lowe, who then approached Jason Latour to write a series based on that character. Latour was concerned about restoring Gwen Stacy to life in even an alternate-universe form, given the canonical consequences of her death more than 40 years earlier, but eventually conceded, and approached Robbi Rodriguez to design the character. Latour prompted Rodriguez to keep her mysterious and to avoid anything that would prematurely reveal her identity, saying that she [...] "should feel like anyone could be under that mask." [...] Slott previously had envisioned a costume based on her clothing in the two-part death story, [...] "The Night Gwen Stacy Died" [...] (1973), except red and blue with web patterns and a half mask. She would also have had a trench coat {{that would have been}} red with webs. Slott ultimately approved of Rodriquez' design.

500|$|In 2006, in {{acknowledgment}} of the [...] "wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website. The developers acknowledged that the Halo series' use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven's Ringworld and Iain M. Banks' Culture series (of which Consider Phlebas and Excession {{were said to be}} particularly influential). In a retrospective article <b>in</b> <b>Edge,</b> Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, [...] "The influence of something like Ringworld isn't necessarily in the design– it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there." [...] Griesemer also explained, [...] "One of the main sources of inspiration was Armor , in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential." [...] The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley's The Vang; it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name [...] "John 117" [...] may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley's Starhammer, or to the John Spartan character of Demolition Man. An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the Halo franchise commented on similarities between Halo and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game: aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron's film Aliens as a strong cinematic influence.|$|E
