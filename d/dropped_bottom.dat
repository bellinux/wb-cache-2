The following home match against Crystal Palace was moved to Selhurst Park, where Brentford suffered a 2-0 defeat and <b>dropped</b> to <b>bottom</b> place in the Football League.|$|R
50|$|In theory, reading only {{requires}} asserting {{the word}} line WL {{and reading the}} SRAM cell state by a single access transistor and bit line, e.g. M6, BL. Nevertheless, bit lines are relatively long and have large parasitic capacitance. To speed up reading, a more complex process is used in practice: The read cycle is started by precharging both bit lines BL and BL, i.e., driving the bit lines to a threshold voltage (midrange voltage between logical 1 and 0) by an external module (not shown in the figures). Then asserting the word line WL enables both the access transistors M5 and M6, which causes the bit line BL voltage to either slightly <b>drop</b> (<b>bottom</b> NMOS transistor M3 is ON and top PMOS transistor M4 is off) or rise (top PMOS transistor M4 is on). It {{should be noted that}} if BL voltage rises, the BL voltage drops, and vice versa. Then the BL and BL lines will have a small voltage difference between them. A sense amplifier will sense which line has the higher voltage and thus determine whether there was 1 or 0 stored. The higher the sensitivity of the sense amplifier, the faster the read operation.|$|R

50|$|The line {{covers a}} 753 m {{vertical}} <b>drop.</b> Its <b>bottom</b> station {{is located at}} 1090 m and the upper one at 1850 m. Cabins transport capacity is of 20 people and the trip, which does not have intermediate stops, lasts 3'40". The line has a single span and two independent sections with one cabin each, that can be operated separately. Cables length is 1450 m and the speed of cabins is usually 10 m/s Fuente Dé ropeway is the longest single-span aerial lift of Europe.|$|R
40|$|A Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) is {{designed}} to be used for operating temperature till 500 ⁰C. Attempt has been made to treat the gaseous effluents of Aluminum industry for abatement of Fluorides using FBR. Red Mud (RM) is used as the bed material. Air is used as the Fluidizing medium and the gaseous effluent is fed as the secondary fluid. Bed material (RM) is analyzed before the experiments. The Hydrodynamics and the reaction results of the FBR are studied using Aspen Plus v 8. 4 simulation software package. The fluidization velocity, TDH, solids holdup, surface area, distributor pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>bottom</b> zone pressure <b>drop,</b> freeboard pressure drop, fluidized bed pressure drop, overall pressure drop and the change in the amount of reactants and the amount of product formed are evaluated from the simulation package. The phase composition and structural transition of the bed materials fluidized at different temperatures are investigated after the experiment. The presence of components such as AlF 3, FeF 2, FeF 3 and NaF in the bed material confirmed the abatement of Fluorides from the gaseous effluents. The simulated results obtained from the ASPEN PLUS Simulation software package indicated the reduction of Fluorides from the gaseous effluents by approx. 25...|$|R

50|$|Congo tetras are egg layers. While {{little is}} known about their wild {{breeding}} habits.

60|$|The crab, {{which had}} quickly righted, now backed, {{still holding the}} crushed {{propeller}} in its iron grasp, and as it {{moved away from the}} Scarabaeus, it extracted about forty feet of its propeller-shaft; then, opening its massive jaws, it allowed the useless mass of iron to <b>drop</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{first single}} and biggest hit was [...] "Better Days (And The <b>Bottom</b> <b>Drops</b> Out)." [...] It became a Top 40 hit and went {{gold in the}} summer of 1999. It was also ranked on other Billboard charts, {{including}} peaks of #3 on Modern Rock, #33 on Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, and #1 on Top 40 Recurrents. A remix of [...] "Better Days (And The <b>Bottom</b> <b>Drops</b> Out)" [...] was used in the 2000 movie Gone in 60 Seconds, and the original version was used in the video game, Street Skater 2, along with [...] "Under the Influence." [...] "Salt Bag Spill" [...] was featured on The Animal soundtrack in 2001. The band was managed by Jeff Castelaz, who later founded Dangerbird Records, and continues to manage keyboardist Dave Cooley in his work as a producer and mixer.|$|R
30|$|In {{our second}} method, we <b>drop</b> the <b>bottom</b> 9.2 % of pre-Prop 209 admits. We then repeat the {{matching}} {{for the remaining}} pre-Prop 209 students’ Dale and Krueger effects to their post-Prop 209 counterparts by matching percentiles of their distributions. Since we assume in {{this version of the}} matching procedure that the excess UC rejections in the post-Prop 209 regime represent the least prepared minority students, in contrast to the previous assumption that the distribution did not change, we consider this method a lower bound on behavioral response, and therefore also an upper bound on the effect of selection.|$|R
50|$|At {{first glance}} the falls drop about 300 ft {{out of a}} hanging valley in one lofty plunge. The height of the plunge is {{actually}} 320 ft. The falls are more than that though, as there are two obvious smaller tiers below the main drop {{as well as one}} just visible above the main <b>drop.</b> The <b>bottom</b> two <b>drops</b> are 40 and 20 ft high while the height of the upper drop is not known. In any case, assuming the upper drop is at least 20 ft high, the falls are likely around 400 ft high.|$|R
