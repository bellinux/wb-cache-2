Generally, an item listed as a factory second will have failed quality inspection for cosmetic, rather than <b>functional,</b> <b>reasons.</b> Such items are often heavily discounted, but may not have as all-encompassing a warranty or guarantee as a full-quality item (for example, the product may be non-returnable).|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} {{the eye of the}} dung beetle Onthophagus posticus was investigated by light and electron microscopy and compared with that of other scarabaeid beetles in an effort to relate eye anatomy and life style. The eye of 0. posticus displays features like well-developed crystalline cones, presence of a clear-zone, and fused rhabdoms of 7 rhabdomeres, which are in line with the phylogenetic and taxonomic position of this species. However, a slight departure from a strictly nocturnal mode of life is indicated by the high degree of orthogonally-arranged rhabdom microvilli of approximately 50 nm in diameter and the absence of a tracheal tapetum. It is concluded that the basis for e-vector detection is present in 0. posticus, and, therefore, astro-orientation to maintain a straight path is possible. The division of the eye into a narrow dorsal sliver and a major ventral part is noted, but its <b>functional</b> <b>reason</b> remains enigmatic...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{networks}} {{can maintain}} memories for decades despite the short lifetime of synaptic strength. Can a neural network store long-lasting memories in unstable synapses? Here, we study {{the effects of}} random noise on the stability of memory stored in synapses of an attractor neural network. The model includes ongoing spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that certain classes of STDP rules can lead to the stabilization of memory patterns stored in the network. The stabilization results from rehearsals induced by noise. We show that unstructured neural noise, after passing through the recurrent network weights, carries the imprint of all memory patterns in temporal correlations. Under certain conditions, STDP combined with these correlations, can lead to reinforcement of all existing patterns, even those that are never explicitly visited. Thus, unstructured neural noise can stabilize the existing structure of synaptic connectivity. Our findings may provide the <b>functional</b> <b>reason</b> for highly irregular spiking displayed by cortical neurons and provide justification for models of system memory consolidation. Therefore, we propose that irregular neural activity is the feature that helps cortical networks maintain stable connections...|$|R
40|$|Seminal {{studies by}} Richardson and Thornton defined the {{constraints}} imposed by protein structure on disulfide formation and flagged forbidden regions of primary or secondary structure seemingly incapable of forming disulfide bonds between resident cysteine pairs. With respect to secondary structure, disulfide bonds {{were not found}} between cysteine pairs: A. on adjacent beta-stands; B. in a single helix or strand; C. on non-adjacent strands of the same beta-sheet. In primary structure, disulfide bonds were not found between cysteine pairs: D. adjacent in the sequence. In the intervening years it has become apparent that all these forbidden regions are indeed occupied by disulfide-bonded cysteines, albeit rather strained ones. It has been observed that sources of strain in a protein structure, such as residues in forbidden regions of the Ramachandran plot and cis-peptide bonds, are found in functionally important regions of the protein and warrant further investigation. Like the Ramachandran plot, the earlier studies by Richardson and Thornton have identified a fundamental truth in protein stereochemistry: "forbidden" disulfides adopt strained conformations, but there is likely a <b>functional</b> <b>reason</b> for this. Emerging evidence supports a role for forbidden disulfides in redox-regulation of proteins. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In {{a context}} of ageing human population, the {{question}} of the elderly people's sexuality, a recent phenomenon, remains without precise and obvious answer. Still, the sexuality of the older person must be viewed as the continuation of the adult's sexuality. However, it is partially or completely, depending on gender, dissociated from the concept of reproduction. Partly for this <b>functional</b> <b>reason,</b> the society estimates that the elderly person cannot feel sexual desire, are not physically attractive, therefore not desirable. Even if they felt sexual need, they would be physiologically unable. Sexuality {{is an integral part of}} the quality of life, well-being, and undoubtedly of the person's health whatever their age. It is thus important to deal with this matter from a physiological and biological point of view. Sexuality and deteriorations related to the process of ageing have to be taken into consideration. These deteriorations are not automatically linked to the increase in longevity. It is in the responsibility of health workers, professionally in charge of the elderly people, to help them better understand their desires which lies in a framework of normality. A greater knowledge of their sexuality will fight the current repression of the sexuality of the elder ones. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the flint {{assemblage}} of the Vlaardingen site Wateringse Binnentuinen is analysed {{with a special}} focus on scrapers. Compared to other Vlaardingen sites, a striking amount of scrapers was found at WBT. To see if this could have a <b>functional</b> <b>reason</b> the scrapers were divided in multiple typological groups and their use-life was researched. During the technological and use-wear analysis {{it became clear that}} the Vlaardingen people at this site were very opportunistic in the production of flint artefacts. However even though the number of scrapers is high at this site, the use-wear analysis shows that almost all scrapers were used for scraping hide. But not all the hide traces were the same; besides the presence of dry and fresh hide four different groups of hide traces were also recognised. Since it was not clear what could have caused the development of these hide wear traces, experiments were designed and conducted to see if the edge angle and the surface where scraping was conducted could explain these differences. Unfortunately the wear traces on the experiments were not developed enough to provide an explanation. When combining the results of the use-life study with the permanent character of the settlement one can likely speak of a site with a very specialised trad...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{products}} are primarily desirable for aesthetic rather than <b>functional</b> <b>reasons.</b> An obvious {{example of such}} a product is clothing. Such products experience a cycle of desirability referred to as a [...] "fashion cycle".

Sneakers are popular fashion industry where this is prevalent - Nike's Air Max line of running shoes is a prime example where a single model of shoe is often produced for years, but the color and material combination ("colorway") is changed every few months, or different colorways are offered in different markets. This has the upshot of ensuring constant demand for the product, even though it remains fundamentally the same.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the reanalysis of the flint assemblage from area IV(4) from the Lower Palaeolithic site Barnham East Farm, which was dated {{to the beginning of the}} Hoxnian interglacial (MIS 11). Barnham is an important site to the Clactonian debated as it was the only site where it was believed that a biface assemblage was contemporaneous to a non-biface assemblage. However, new fieldwork suggested that a palimpsest was present in area IV(4). The new analysis concentrated on the technological classification of the artefacts, their distribution and preservation. Preservation was investigated by analysing abrasion, patination, breakage, edge damage and surface scratching. It was proven that, based on abrasion and distribution, a slow accumulation palimpsest (cf. Malinsky-Buller et al. 2011) is present in area IV(4). This palimpsest consists of an older, non-biface component overprinted by a younger component with evidence for biface manufacture. This is in contrast to the previous interpretation of Barnham, which concluded that the non-biface assemblage (area I) and the biface assemblage (area IV(4)) were contemporaneous. The new analysis supports a sequence with an older non-biface assemblage (Clactonian) and a younger biface assemblage (Acheulean). Two models remain that explain this sequence: the resource and landscape model (cf. Ashton 1998 a), that suggests a <b>functional</b> <b>reason</b> for the disappearance of bifaces from the archaeological record, and a demographic model, that contributes the loss of bifaces to a decline in population sizes...|$|R
