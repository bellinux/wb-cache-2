50|$|A better {{approximation}} {{assumes the}} Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an oblate spheroid); azimuth then {{has at least}} two very slightly different meanings. Normal-section azimuth is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the spheroid; <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> is the angle between north and the geodesic; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100 km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{geodetic}} networks for guiding Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) inside long tunnels {{depends largely on}} the correct use of a gyroscope. These networks {{are based on a}} series of control points at the tunnel entrance, and link each station by means of survey observations as they advance along the tunnel. Once, the networks are used to guide the TBM, they are no longer checked again. It is necessary to perform high accuracy astronomical observations to stars {{in order to determine the}} gyrotheodolite constant. Since astronomical observations cannot be made inside tunnels, <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuths</b> have to be used for the computations. However, these azimuths cannot theoretically be compared with the astronomical azimuths obtained by the gyrotheodolite. An alternative is to compute the instrument constant using the values of the deviation of the vertical derived from a geoid model. That is the approach used in this work where a methodology for the design of underground networks in long tunnels is also presented. This procedure has been implemented during the construction of the Guadarrama and Pajares high-speed railway tunnels (Spain) ...|$|R
40|$|The Leica 1200 series total {{stations}} {{have the ability}} to connect to a Differential Global Positioning Receiver (GPS) via Bluetooth. With a GPS mounted {{on the top of the}} Total Station, a position and height for a station can be obtained. The only other piece of information that is needed is the orientation. The aim of this report is to investigate the potential for using Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) to take sun observations for the calculation of <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuths,</b> to reduce pointing errors associated with solar observations. A protective filter lens was constructed that enabled safe and functional tracking of the sun. Software was also written that calculates an azimuth in the field to assist with the testing of the accuracy of this method. It was found that using the ATR tracking method on the sun was approximately twice as accurate when compared with the manual pointing method. The results of an averaged twelve set observation achieved results with a standard deviation of 12 ” over 11 observation periods, with a maximum error of 23 ”, when comparing the azimuth from the sun with the local geodetic control marks over a 350 m baseline. When compared to RTK GPS readings taken over the same baseline, the solar observations were found to give approximately twice as accurate an azimuth 72 % of the time. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Analysis of the {{orientation}} of the longitudinal axis of 81 dolmens in Bulgaria is presented. The magnetic azimuths Am were measured by clinometers SUUNTO TANDEM and the positions – by GPS-device. The rough correction ∆Am of the magnetic deviation of 5 ° (for the Eastern Rhodopes) and 4 ° (for the Sakar Mountain and the Strandzha Mountain) was applied in order to obtain the <b>geodetic</b> (from North) <b>azimuths</b> Ao=Am+∆Am. The measured azimuths occupy the sector from Ao= 90 ° to 300 °. It is impossible to consider the dolmens as a homogeneous group. The topographic analysis shows that {{the orientation}} towards some height or peak {{in the vicinity of the}} dolmen or even towards more distant targets (up to 50 km) prevails. Some of the North Sakar dolmens near the village of Hlyabovo are oriented to other dolmens. Some questions arising from this study and proposals for further investigations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the azimuth of the reference mark is of crucial importance in {{the determination of the}} declination which is defined as the ellipsoidal (<b>geodetic)</b> <b>azimuth</b> of the geomagnetic meridian. The accuracy of the azimuth determination has direct impact on the accuracy of the declination. The orientation of the Declination-Inclination Magnetometer is usually carried out by sighting the reference mark in two telescope faces in order to improve the reliability of the observations and eliminate some instrumental errors. In this paper, different coordinate as well as azimuth determination methods using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observation techniques within VPPS (High-Precision Positioning Service) and GPPS (Geodetic-Precision Positioning Service) services of the CROPOS (CROatian POsitioning System) system were explained. The azimuth determination by the observation of the Polaris was exposed and it was subsequently compared with the observation of the Sun using hour-angle and zenith-distance method. The procedure of the calculation of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> from the astronomic azimuth was explained. The azimuth results obtained by different methods were compared and the recommendations on the minimal distance between repeat station and azimuth mark were given. The results shown in this paper were based on the observations taken on the POKU_SV repeat station. </p...|$|E
30|$|Rigid {{seafloor}} {{arrays of}} three to four precision acoustic transponders have been repeatedly positioned with the GPS-Acoustic technique to measure horizontal plate motion. In the event that one transponder becomes inactive, a replacement transponder must be precisely located relative to the existing array. Here we present a technique to determine the <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> and baseline between the inactive and replacement transponders. We include three examples of relocations between 2002 and 2003 on the Juan de Fuca plate and near the Peru-Chile trench, which add ± 16 – 29 mm uncertainty to the GPS-Acoustic estimated position. A simulation of optimal network geometry shows that the relocation’s contribution to uncertainty can be as low as ± 10 mm.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Basic {{geodetic}} {{theory is}} applied to determine the <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> and geodetic altitude required to point dish antennas to geostationary communi-cation satellites. The mathematical treatment presented here takes into consider-ation the ellipticity of the earth. This generalization contrasts with standard formulas published intechnical books in satellite communication e gineering where a spher-ical approximation is implemented. Comparisons between the spherical nd more rigorous ellipsoidal methods are discussed. Although {{the differences between the}} two approaches are not significant, hey should be taken into consideration when very precise pointing to geostationary communication satellites or other space ob-jects is dictated. The suggested method is simple to understand and straightforward to implement, and due to its advantages should replace any spherical alternative currently in use...|$|E

40|$|Sun {{observations}} {{provide a}} robust way {{for determining the}} <b>geodetic</b> or true <b>azimuth</b> at a location. Azimuth is generally defined as the angle in the plane measured from the meridian’s north (or south) {{to the location of}} the line of interest. It is common to use the north azimuth; also referred to as “azimuth”, especially in civilian surveying applications. The astronomic meridian is obtained through astronomic observations of the Sun or North Star (Polaris) and it is important since it provides one instance of the geodetic or true meridian. There are two methods for determining the sun azimuth; the first is known as the hour angle method and the other is called the altitude method. The hour angle method requires the determination of accurate time while altitude method requires accurate vertical angle. The hour angle method is more popular because it is more accurate, can be performed at any time of day and is applicable to the sun, Polaris and other stars. In this article, an error modeling framework for the errors result in the process of determining the sun azimuth using the hour angle method; namely random errors, is presented. A Gauss-Markov model is used to represent the errors in the true azimuth estimation process. Six sets of sun observation for azimuth data; three with telescope direct and three reverse, including horizontal circle’s readings and time were collected and used in order to estimate the true azimuth of a line in a study area in central Orlando, Florida, United States...|$|R
40|$|The azimuths {{obtained}} from astronomic observation and GPS survey were evaluated to show significant differences. Astronomic observation {{was used in}} azimuth determination for old surveys in the Philippines, but is gradually being replaced {{by the use of}} the GPS, because of its rapid measuring capability and weather independency. However, GPS provides a different type of azimuth as compared to astronomic observation. The relationship and precision of both techniques were tested on various baselines located {{in different parts of the}} country. Nine baselines in five cities from around the Philippine Archipelago were chosen as test sites to compare the difference between the measured GPS azimuth and astronomic azimuth. Dual frequency GPS receivers were used to measure <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> using static GPS technique while the astronomic observations made use of series of solar observations using a Wilde T 2 theodolite. The differences in measured azimuth were analyzed and evaluated using the standards of project control accuracy in the Philippines. The results derived from the two methods yielded comparative difference of amounts less than 15 seconds in all test sites, the minimum requirement of PE for tertiary project controls. This means that in the establishment of project controls of at least tertiary control requirements, azimuth from GPS and astronomi...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the astronomical azimuth of a line is not a difficult task for surveyors any more. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the theoretical details and errors in order to propose the use of ordinary total stations, for an easy, efficient and accurate {{determination of}} the astronomical azimuth of a line by the hour angle method via Polaris sightings. As many modern total stations have a built - in quartz clock they can register automatically the UTC time as well as the angle measurements (horizontal and zenith) of each observation. The total fieldwork time needed is about 10 minutes and the accuracy that may be achieved is about ± 2 D' 7 his procedure will be proven to be easier than the {{determination of the}} <b>geodetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> of the same line. The calculation is independent and the result is free of the errors that the coordinates of a survey mark may contain, because they are not used. However good positional data is required from other sources. Astronomical azimuths are an alternative solution for the surveyors in order to check or orient their field surveys and arbitrary networks independent of the GPS system. © 2008 Survey Review Ltd...|$|E
