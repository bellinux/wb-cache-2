5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} Norman castles were built from timber, {{but by the end}} of the 11thcentury a few, {{including}} the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower– which gives the whole castle its name– is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point {{of the early}} castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.|$|E

25|$|In her {{contribution}} to the seminal book Anti-Americanisms in World Politics edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, Sophie Meunier writes about French anti-Americanism.

25|$|During the Babylonian captivity, Daniel and {{his fellow}} Jews abstained from the meat and wine given {{to them by the}} king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though {{precisely}} how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text.

25|$|That is, since a {{high number}} of deaths are {{required}} to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are N such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9N times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
