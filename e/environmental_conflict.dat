40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the management of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> in post-genocide Rwanda through decentralization. The study advances knowledge {{in the field of}} peace and development. The thesis contributes an exploration of whether and how decentralization promotes the management of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The study’s central argument is that, on the basis of experiences in Musanze, Kayonza and Rubavu districts of Rwanda since 2000, decentralization can contribute to <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> management, though {{the nature and extent of}} that contribution will be limited if policy is not backed by sufficient resources. Theoretically, the thesis follows literature on <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> management and peacebuilding. Concepts of devolution, participation, and responsiveness are used as analytical tools. Methodologically, data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observation and documentary analysis from Musanze, Kayonza and Rubavu districts of Rwanda. The thesis findings show that the ongoing decentralization in Musanze, Kayonza and Rubavu districts has so far contributed to the management of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Through creation of local institutions, local leaders and local communities have contributed in the management of conflicts over land, water and forests. However, inadequate resources, personnel, knowledge and skills at the local levels in the three districts have limited the effectiveness of decentralization’s contribution with regard to the management of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> As regards advancements of the research front, this study claims to have contributed to the existing academic debates in peace, conflict and development by filling the gap in the literature, particularly in the ways that environmental peacebuilding is pursued through a decentralized approach. In terms of policy implication, a better understanding of decentralization’s contribution to the management of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> particularly at the local level is an important step to think about how to empower local authorities with more capacity, and resources in order to effectively address local <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> are a {{familiar}} phenomenon in all industrial societies, {{and social scientists}} have produced {{a great number of}} studies of different <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> One conventional way to conceptualize them is known as NIMBY ("not in my backyard"). Although the recent NIMBY literature has revealed the complexity of the issue, the approach continues to be beset by a number of problems. It has been difficult to conceptualize the dynamic character of a conflict from this perspective. This paper suggests that the theory of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> should shift in an epistemological and social interactionist direction, toward social constructionist theory. This paper offers a constructionist analysis of three <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Finland. The disputes over the siting of a nuclear waste facility are viewed as processes of perceiving radioactive waste in the different municipalities. The conflicts are examined as struggles over scientific‐technical, economic, and political definitions of the radioactive objects and of the conflicts themselves...|$|R

40|$|Although {{collaborative}} {{processes are}} already being promoted as a strategy for managing <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflicts,</b> the factors that promote and hinder effective collaborative processes in cases of environmental justice {{have not yet been}} explored. A case study approach identified the unique characteristics of <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflicts</b> and provides a nuanced insight into the implications of these characteristics for collaborative problem-solving in <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflict</b> situations. Collaborative processes in New York City’s West Harlem, Washington, D. C., and Richmond, California are studied. <b>Environmental</b> justice <b>conflicts</b> have characteristics that distinguish them from other types of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The issues in an <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflict</b> have a human rights orientation and are framed to emphasize dimensions of race, class, discrimination, and injustice. Past procedural injustices and the suppression or inaccessibility of relevant information characterize the nature of the decision-making processes traditionally followed in managing <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflicts.</b> Parties to an <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflict</b> have traumatic histories of racial and economic discrimination, different social locations, perceived power differentials, high distrust, low network ties, and incongruent communication norms. These characteristics challenge common assumptions about the nature of collaboration in <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflict</b> situations. When presented with opportunities to participate in a collaborative process, environmental justice participants’ incentives to participate were limited. The presence of trusted and respectful leaders who are motivated to build relationships with other groups and communities can transform the nature of the opportunity and enhance participation. Building the capacities of environmental justice participants is important in fostering effective collaborative processes, but it is equally important to build the capacities of all parties engaged in the collaborative process to recognize and address the unique attributes of the environmental justice dimension of the conflict. Finally, the unique characteristics of <b>environmental</b> justice <b>conflicts</b> create complexities in collaborative problem-solving processes that warrant attention in how processes are structured and managed in an environmental justice context...|$|R

We found that Europe and Japan are progressively more dependent on imports from developing countries to cover internal copper demand. In contrast, copper production in the USA has considerably increased during recent decades. During the 1990 s, there was a boom of Latin American copper exports, led by Chile. We point out that population density, negotiation strategies, environmental performance, distribution of profits and the local notion of social rights are the major steering forces of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> in the mining sector. We argue that the location of mines in isolated regions, stricter environmental policies and investments in updating environmental technologies have prevented the emergence of <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> during the Chilean copper boom.

Finally, we identify several types of peasant <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> between 18 th and 20 th centuries: environmental peasant protests in Mediterranean Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa; conflicts produced around resources like water, common goods or against pollution, Land Reform, reactions to environmental policies or defence of indigenous territories.

40|$|The {{mass media}} is {{part and parcel}} of modern life. In recent years <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts</b> have {{increasingly}} become part of the public agenda, and they now gain vast media coverage. While all agree that fully functioning media sectors are essential for expanding and supporting democracy on global, national, and local levels alike, many claim that the media’s interference, by definition, escalates conflicts. Recent studies confirm that many roles can be attributed to media coverage, including some that lead conflicts toward constructive resolutions. The hypothesis of our research is that through frames, the media is both influenced by and influential with regard to the conflict’s dynamics. This paper presents parts of a research project, aimed at improving the understanding of the framing and reframing processes of intractable <b>environmental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> It introduces a hybrid typology for analyzing the media framing and reframing patterns, and discusses the frames used by the media while covering four Israeli case studies.
