50|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is {{primarily}} the reduction of unsprung weight which improves handling and ride. The suspension {{does not have to}} resist twisting when the brakes are applied. The wheels don't enclose the brake mechanism allowing greater flexibility in wheel offset, and placement of suspension members. It is also much easier to protect the brake mechanism from the outside environment, and protect it from water, dust, and oil. Of secondary importance is <b>flexible</b> <b>brake</b> pipes are avoided; rigid pipes allow increases in brake fluid pressure, allowing for a smaller disc to manage a given braking torque.|$|E
5000|$|An {{unpublished}} typescript {{exists in}} {{the archives of the}} National Motor Museum, written by the son of one of Bowden's employees that attempts to claim the invention of the cable for his father to the point of suggesting that it was never applied to bicycles before 1902. Although this is easily disproved by reference to 'Cycling' or the other UK cycle press through 1896-7, it serves to remind one of the attempts made to rewrite cycle history through priority claims. British National Archives In this narrative a <b>flexible</b> cable <b>brake</b> for cycles was separately 'invented' by George Frederick Larkin, a skilled automobile and motorcycle engineer, who patented his design in 1902. He was subsequently recruited by, and worked for E.M. Bowden until 1917 as General Works Manager."George Larkin is known for his invention of the <b>flexible</b> cable <b>brake</b> for cycles, which was patented in 1902. The original patent for a similar invention known as the 'Bowden mechanism' was granted to Ernest Monnington Bowden in 1896. The following year E.M. Bowden's Patents Syndicate Ltd. was formed to market the device but initially the project was a failure because all the company could offer was a flimsy mechanism capable of transmitting comparatively enormous power. The Bowden Mechanism was not developed in connection with a cycle brake as there is no record of the cable having been associated with the cycle industry until 1902, when George Larkin's invention was patented." ...|$|R

"During Larkin's {{employment}} with Bassett Motor Syndicate {{his duties}} included {{the assembly of}} motor cars and motor cycles, and a major difficulty was the assembly of the braking systems which at that time comprised steel rods, not easily adaptable to the contour of the chassis. He designed a <b>flexible</b> cable <b>brake</b> and approached S.J. Withers, Patent Agent, to have the design patented. Withers noticed the similarity of Larkin's idea to the Bowden Mechanism and {{introduced him to the}} Bowden Syndicate, who agreed to manufacture and market the invention with the proviso that it should be patented jointly in the names of the inventor and themselves. Within a few months, Larkin, then aged 23, was engaged as Motor Department Manager with E.M. Bowden's Patents Syndicate, and he was appointed General Works Manager on 1 May 1904." ...|$|R

In {{the sight}} of {{friction}} hoist machine transmission characteristics, analysis {{of the possibility of}} friction hoist machine sliding ropes phenomenon, sliding ropes phenomenon can be divided into safety slide and dangerous slide two states. In order to avoid the occurrence of the friction hoist machine container overwind, overfall major accident caused by steel wire ropes dangerous slide, using two encoders to sample the speed of friction hoist machine wheel and the actual speed of steel wire ropes, concluding and analyzing the sliding ropes state of friction machine, according to the hoist container position and sliding ropes trend when the steel wire ropes of friction hoist machine start to slide, determining the dangerous state of sliding ropes. Designed the sliding ropes hydraulic brake device, with the adjustable sliding ropes brake torque and fast dynamic response control function, preventing the hoist container overwind, overfall major accident, as the same time, minimizing the machinery injury to the steel wire ropes when the sliding ropes are <b>braked,</b> realizing <b>flexible</b> sliding ropes <b>brake...</b>|$|R
