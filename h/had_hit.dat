5|$|He {{at first}} denied being {{anywhere}} near the Farm, then during interview four {{said he had been}} there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, he said he <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Marsh bowled for England. Farrell and Poulton batted for Australia. Poulton {{scored a}} single {{off the first}} ball she faced, before being caught by Colvin on the fourth ball. This left Australia at 1/4 and they ended at 2/6. England also ended with 2/6 after a run out {{in an attempt to}} secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> more sixes in the match—Jess Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E

5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> another period of {{financial}} trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse {{to move to}} continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot. After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Gomez {{was charged}} with murder after a gang fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> one of his attackers, Sam Parle, who died after his head hit the {{pavement}} {{as a result of}} the blow. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in self-defence.|$|E
5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> his horse and gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled hand, but he was still suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E
5|$|In other {{baseball}} leagues, {{the cycle}} is achieved less frequently. Through September 4, 2008, 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the top-level baseball organization in Japan, <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle, {{the most recent}} being Rainel Rosario. Two players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle {{on the same day}} once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history.

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of individuals hitting {{home runs in}} consecutive at-bats is not unusual, but three or more is rare. If a player hits three home runs in a game, it is termed a hat-trick (which is also used for a player getting three strikeouts in a game). The record for consecutive home runs by a batter under any circumstances is 4. Of the sixteen players (through 2012) who <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> 4 in one game, six <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> them consecutively. Twenty-eight other batters <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> four consecutive across two games.|$|R

5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from {{his office at the}} CNN New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> the World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George W. Bush was arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Initial news reports speculated that the crash had been an accident until United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the South Tower 17 minutes after Flight 11 made impact.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone <b>had</b> <b>hit,</b> the Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food blankets and utensils.|$|E

5|$|On May 6, Hamels was {{suspended}} for five games after hitting Bryce Harper in his lower back with a pitch, after admitting that it was intentional. On July 21, 2012, Hamels hit his first career home run off San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain, who had homered off {{of him in the}} top half of the same inning, the first time in MLB that two pitchers <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> home runs off of each other in the same inning.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales {{was forced}} to {{disengage}} {{by a combination of}} damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after Hood was sunk. Despite these problems, she <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> Bismarck three times. One of these hits contaminated {{a good portion of the}} ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in occupied France where she could be repaired. Bismarck was temporarily able to evade detection, but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2012 season, Huff <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> 242 career home runs, tying him for 217th all-time with Dusty Baker, Sal Bando, Wally Berger, Roy Campanella, and J. D. Drew.

50|$|Eight players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a {{grand slam}} as the home run of their cycle; in the 21st century, that list has {{included}} Miguel Tejada, Jason Kubel, Tony Lazzeri, and Bengie Molina. Seven players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a walk-off home run {{to win the game}} as the final hit of their cycles: Boyer, César Tovar, George Brett, Dwight Evans, Carlos González, and Nolan Arenado. In 2009, Ian Kinsler <b>had</b> six <b>hits</b> in the game when he hit his cycle; the accomplishment came on Jackie Robinson Day, honoring the African-American pioneer who <b>had</b> himself <b>hit</b> for the cycle on August 29, 1948.|$|R

5|$|Anniyan was {{declared}} a blockbuster {{at the close}} of the year and, together with Chandramukhi, earned an estimated gross of 1.1 billion worldwide. The film also collected a distributor's share of 20 million. In Andhra Pradesh, Aparichitudu was named the biggest hit of 2005. The film did better business than straight Telugu films. It was the highest grosser among all Telugu films released that year. The film's success earned Vikram a big fan-following in Andhra. It also prompted producers in the Telugu film industry, which <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a rough patch following a spate of box-office duds, to acquire the dubbing rights to Vikram's previous Tamil films and release them in Telugu.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

5|$|Brodie joined Southport {{permanently}} on 18 June 2014, being {{signed by}} his former York and Hereford manager Foyle.

Brodie was Southport's top scorer in 2014–15 with 14 goals from 41 appearances as Southport finished 19th in the Conference Premier. He signed a new contract with the club in May 2015.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{was married}} five times. He wed Virginia Cherrill on February 9, 1934 at Caxton Hall {{registry}} office in London. She divorced him on March 26, 1935, following charges that Grant <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> her. The two {{were involved in}} a bitter divorce case which was widely reported in the press, with Cherrill demanding $1000 a week from her husband in benefits from his Paramount earnings. After the demise of the marriage, he dated actress Phyllis Brooks from 1937. They had considered marriage, and vacationed together in Europe in mid-1939, visiting the Roman villa of Dorothy di Frasso in Italy, before the relationship ended later that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> him in the chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested {{the basis of a}} plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E
