500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> and he didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert California (James Spader) {{challenges}} {{office manager}} Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to double sales after a rousing motivational speech. After Andy tries unsuccessfully to mine {{ideas from the}} office employees, he consults a book on management techniques and decides to try an incentives program. He presents a number of items catered to individual employees, which they can purchase with [...] "points" [...] earned by exceptional workplace performance. This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees, but when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points, he offers to tattoo whatever his co-workers would like on <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> in exchange for 5,000 points, not anticipating that anyone {{will be able to}} even come close to this number.|$|E

500|$|... "The Griffin Family History" [...] {{was written}} by John Viener and was {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief. It guest starred Lori Alan as Diane Simmons and featured Chris Sheridan, Joey Slotnick, Danny Smith and Phil LaMarr as various characters. During the episode's depiction of how the universe was created, God exclaims [...] "ah, you smell that?" [...] after holding a lighter to <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> when performing flatus; this segment of audio was not broadcast on the Fox version of the episode. An additional scene not shown during the televised version was when the Griffins are depicted as dinosaurs. Originally, a Michael Jackson-related scene was {{to be included in}} the episode, but it was re-scheduled for a later episode due to limited time on this episode. In the original draft of the episode, Brian's speech informing Peter of the dangers in the woods during the Nate Griffin story was intended to be longer, including Brian talking about automobile ratings, though it was shortened for unknown reasons. MacFarlane praises the animation sequence showing a horse running around Lois' bedroom, describing it as [...] "a piece of brilliance".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{successful}} was Death Warrant (1990), {{the first}} script credit for David S. Goyer; Van Damme played a cop who goes undercover in a prison. He followed it with Lionheart (1990) aka Wrong Bet, {{where he played}} a French Legionnaire who deserts his post to return to Los Angeles after his brother is murdered. Lionheart was directed by Sheldon Lettich who had co-written Bloodsport, and who claimed the film was [...] "the first movie to demonstrate that Van Damme {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan [...] "Karate Guy" [...] who would never rise above simplistic low-budget karate movies." [...] It also featured rear nudity from Van Damme which Lettich says [...] "became a very memorable moment for the ladies in the audience, and for the gay guys as well. Showing off <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> (clothed or unclothed) almost became a signature trademark of his after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steven Hoskins, on Wednesday, March 23, 2010, {{testified against}} Barry Bonds as a {{government}} witness in the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} case against the former baseball star. Hoskins described Barry Bonds's use of anabolic steroids, and how his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, would discuss taking the steroids in an open manner. Even though Hoskins never witnessed Barry Bonds actually taking the drugs, he witnessed Anderson handling the needle, and Barry Bonds {{going in and out of}} the bedroom, and Barry Bonds complaining about the shots leaving <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> sore. Barry Bonds would use his girlfriends to get the steroids, and would pay them a few thousand dollars at a time. Heisler analyzes the different sports and their testings. [...] Like most other sports, baseball has a testing policy. The policy states that a player cannot be tested without reason. Meaning, that there must be a very specific reason why a player should be tested.|$|E
5000|$|Knes {{was first}} {{recognised}} through his work about adolescence: {{a series of}} photographes called [...] "E.M.T. in MSP".

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Daughtry was mixed; while many critics {{felt that the}} album was generally pleasing and the first real [...] "rock" [...] album from American Idol alumni, others felt it was unoriginal and too commercial. [...] While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has [...] "strong pipes and palpable angst", overall he found the band [...] "generic", calling them [...] "FuelNickelStaindback". People magazine found the album [...] "a solid if not spectacular effort that {{at the very least}} proves that Chris Daughtry is not just another Idol also-ran." [...] Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that [...] " [...] Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, but just because he can howl like a motherfucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball." [...] In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album [...] "is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed," [...] then added, [...] "But [...] Daughtry sure does sing <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> off." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, calling the album [...] "a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its ilk." [...] In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending [...] "cultural Armageddon." [...] He remarked, [...] "It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty." ...|$|E

60|$|In the meantime, Osborn and Thorn, {{who shared}} <b>his</b> <b>butt,</b> looked about {{while they waited}} for the beaters. The row of turf banks, {{regularly}} spaced, ran back to the Force Crags {{at the head of the}} dale. The red bloom of the ling was fading from the moor, which had begun to get brown. Sunshine and shadow swept across it, and the blue sky was dotted by flying, white-edged clouds. A keen wind swept the high tableland, and the grouse, flying before it, would come over the butts very fast.|$|E

6000|$|... "If he {{were of a}} {{suspicious}} temper, he might not," [...] interposed the man in gray calmly, [...] "it {{is one of the}} imbecilities of the suspicious person to fancy that every stranger, however absent-minded, he sees so much as smiling or gesturing to himself in any odd sort of way, is secretly making him <b>his</b> <b>butt.</b> In some moods, the movements of an entire street, as the suspicious man walks down it, will seem an express pantomimic jeer at him. In short, the suspicious man kicks himself with his own foot." ...|$|E
60|$|Each of {{his companions}} became in turn <b>his</b> <b>butt.</b> Malone had a stock of jokes at their service, {{which he was}} {{accustomed}} to serve out regularly on convivial occasions like the present, seldom varying his wit; for which, indeed, there was no necessity, as he never appeared to consider himself monotonous, and did not at all care what others thought. Mr. Donne he favoured with hints about his extreme meagreness, allusions to his turned-up nose, cutting sarcasms on a certain threadbare chocolate surtout which that gentleman was accustomed to sport whenever it rained or seemed likely to rain, and criticisms on a choice set of cockney phrases and modes of pronunciation, Mr. Donne's own property, and certainly deserving of remark for the elegance and finish they communicated to his style.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} silence, {{a much longer}} one. The Honorable Heth threw <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> away, and lighted another cigar. Suddenly, as if by magic, his aplomb returned, and {{in a flash of}} {{understanding}} he perceived the situation. He saw himself once more as the successful congressman, the trusted friend of the railroad interests, and he saw Jethro as a discredited boss. He did not stop to reflect that Jethro did not act like a discredited boss, as a keener man might have done. But if the Honorable Heth had been a keener man, he would not have been at that time a congressman. Mr. Sutton accused himself of having been stupid in not grasping at once that the tables were turned, and that now he was the one to dispense the gifts.|$|E

60|$|It {{was through}} no effort of his {{that he became}} {{friendly}} with Dunsford, the fresh-complexioned, heavy lad whose acquaintance he had made {{at the beginning of}} the session. Dunsford attached himself to Philip merely because he was the first person he had known at St. Luke's. He had no friends in London, and on Saturday nights he and Philip got into the habit of going together to the pit of a music-hall or the gallery of a theatre. He was stupid, but he was good-humoured and never took offence; he always said the obvious thing, but when Philip laughed at him merely smiled. He had a very sweet smile. Though Philip made him <b>his</b> <b>butt,</b> he liked him; he was amused by his candour and delighted with his agreeable nature: Dunsford had the charm which himself was acutely conscious of not possessing.|$|E

60|$|And when Fate threw Miss Fowler's nephew, an unlovely orphan of eleven, on Miss Fowler's hands, Mary Postgate {{stood to}} {{her share of}} the {{business}} of education as practised in private and public schools. She checked printed clothes-lists, and unitemised bills of extras; wrote to Head and House masters, matrons, nurses and doctors, and grieved or rejoiced over half-term reports. Young Wyndham Fowler repaid her in his holidays by calling her 'Gatepost,' 'Postey,' or 'Packthread,' by thumping her between her narrow shoulders, or by chasing her bleating, round the garden, her large mouth open, her large nose high in air, at a stiff-necked shamble very like a camel's. Later on he filled the house with clamour, argument, and harangues as to his personal needs, likes and dislikes, and the limitations of 'you women,' reducing Mary to tears of physical fatigue, or, when he chose to be humorous, of helpless laughter. At crises, which multiplied as he grew older, she was his ambassadress and his interpretress to Miss Fowler, who had no large sympathy with the young; a vote in his interest at the councils on his future; his sewing-woman, strictly accountable for mislaid boots and garments; always <b>his</b> <b>butt</b> and his slave.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Butts {{moved to}} Santa Monica {{to accept a}} job as the city's Chief of Police, a {{position}} he served until 2006. During Butts' tenure, crime was reduced by 64 percent. Early in <b>his</b> tenure, <b>Butts</b> conducted a month-long crime assessment {{at the request of}} the city council. In <b>his</b> assessment, <b>Butts</b> concluded that drug dealing and violent crime at Palisades Park could be reduced by enforcing a city ordinance against sleeping in public parks. The city ordinance had been controversial; its enforcement was opposed by city attorney Robert M. Myers, who refused to prosecute homeless people arrested for violating the ordinance. This made it difficult for Butts to it, since those arrested would not be prosecuted.|$|R
