50|$|Externally, it {{was clear}} that the cab design owed a lot to Southern's {{experience}} with the 2HAL multiple unit design. It has even been suggested that (in true Southern tradition) this was because the <b>jigs</b> for the <b>welded</b> cabs already existed and thus made for speedy and cheap construction! At the outbreak of war in 1939, most construction projects were put on hold in favour of the war effort. Construction of CC1 and CC2 was exempted from this, because of promised savings in labour and fuel over steam locomotives. Construction was not smooth, however, and was brought to a halt several times, due to shortage of resources.After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways renumbered them 20001 and 20002 respectively.|$|R

25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset <b>welding</b> <b>jigs</b> in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|R
40|$|Within NASA Space Science, Exploration and the Office of Chief Technologist, {{there are}} Grand Challenges and {{advanced}} future exploration, science and commercial mission applications that could benefit significantly from large-span and large-area structural systems. Of particular and persistent {{interest to the}} Space Science community is the desire for large (in the 10 - 50 meter range for main aperture diameter) space telescopes that would revolutionize space astronomy. Achieving these systems will likely require on-orbit assembly, but previous approaches for assembling large-scale telescope truss structures and systems in space have been perceived as very costly because they require high precision and custom components. These components rely on {{a large number of}} mechanical connections and supporting infrastructure that are unique to each application. In this paper, a new assembly paradigm that mitigates these concerns is proposed and described. A new assembly approach, developed to implement the paradigm, is developed incorporating: Intelligent Precision <b>Jigging</b> Robots, Electron-Beam <b>welding,</b> robotic handling/manipulation, operations assembly sequence and path planning, and low precision weldable structural elements. Key advantages of the new assembly paradigm, as well as concept descriptions and ongoing research and technology development efforts for each of the major elements are summarized...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to “rectify the weld cracks by the fabrication of customized jig plates”. In the engine section of the industry, there were frequent rejections of the catalytic converters due to weld cracks. When the catalytic converter assembly line was inspected, tiny cracks in the weld were found visually. Then they were tested through bench magnifiers and dye penetration test for confirmation and it was confirmed to have cracks in the weld. The crack was found in the casting to shell joint of the catalytic converter. Then the casting was tested for its contaminants which could also cause cracks in the weld. The DED (double end drive) <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> plate setup was also checked thoroughly for any defects. In order to check whether the type of welding used gives better penetration and strength, weld penetration test was done. Finally, after several inspections of the welding process it was found that the crack was due to the biasing of the axis of jig plates. Then, finally the biasing was avoided by fabricating a new jig plate. Thus the entire defect is drastically reduced by minimizing the cracks and thus maintaining the efficiency of the engine...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this final year project is “design and {{fabrication}} of jig for butt welding”. Jigs are special purpose tools which are used to facilitate production like machining, assembling and inspection operations. The purpose of this jig is to hold the specimen of the welding specimen which is the sheet metal. The fabrication purpose {{is to improve the}} quality of welding by making the better jig compare to the older jig. The students use this jig to hold the specimen and welding it by using the MIG welding at the welding machine. The problems are the specimen is bending after welding because affect by thermal stress. The older clamp cannot hold the specimen properly. This jig must be suitable to place on the existed table. The main objective of this study is to design and fabricate <b>jig</b> for butt <b>welding.</b> Also the objective is the jig need to suitable for hold sheet metal. Four designs were drew and compared in terms of durability, cost, size and weight, easy to use and clamping force. The best design is chosen and fabrication according to the measurement. After testing the product, the clamp has improves the clamping force and the specimen is not bending and affect by the thermal stress...|$|R
50|$|Sortino hired a Burlington Vermont bike techinican, Mark P. Walker, {{assisted}} by Tim Matthewson of Champion Cycles, {{to provide a}} marketable bicycle concept that would appeal to commuters and people wishing to have a practical alternative to the mountain bike and road bike without the complication of derailleurs, and above all, made in the U.S. The bicycles sold for $500- $1000, depending on hubs, and options chosen by the customer.50 framesets were originally fabricated by Tri-Angle Metal Fab in Milton, Vermont, and 50 more were made by Waterford Precision cycles of Waterford, Wisconsin, {{under the guise of}} Richard Schwinn (great grandson of Ignaz Schwinn) and Mark Muller. After that, the CBC built their own in a factory on 363 W. Erie in Chicago, Illinois. The Design of the bicycles was carried out cooperatively between the Team in Vermont and the Team in Chicago. Industrial Designers Mr. Patrick Ege, and Mr. Joe Ryan both based in Chicago at the time worked to develop the frame geometries in CAD, <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> setups, and completed most of final prototyping and testing. Mr. Ryan also served as the shop foreman and oversaw fabrication at the facility in Chicago including milling operations, welding, and powder coating. Master Bicycle Technician Mr. Vincent Delfini oversaw the buildup of the frames from custom components selected by customers. Approximately 100 or more were made before the company went out of business in 1997.|$|R
40|$|Laser welding {{trials were}} {{performed}} on thin walled cylindrical Grade 250 maraging steel tubes to determine its suitability as a joining process for rocket motor casings. Bead-on-plate (BOP) and butt welded samples were produced utilising a 5 kW Trumpf TLF 5000 HQ CO 2 laser (M 2 = 1. 82) with a 5 -axis TLC 1005 Lasercell and 200 mm focal length off axis parabolic mirror welding head. The samples were subjected to tensile testing after an aging {{post weld heat treatment}} was performed at 480 ºC for 3 hours. Acceptable results were obtained although some concerns emerged regarding the ability of the <b>welding</b> <b>jig</b> to ensure repeatability of joint fit-up and alignment of the laser beam with respect to the seam. Alternative techniques such as dual focus (twin spot), scanner welding, addition of filler material and pulsed Nd:YAG welding were investigated to increase the operating window compared to autogenous single spot laser welding by making the process less sensitive to fit up and alignment. Metallurgical investigations were also performed to compare the microstructures produced by the various welding techniques. Twin spot and pulsed Nd:YAG welding increased the tolerance with regards to laser beam offset to 0. 5 mm compared to 0. 2 mm for single spot autogenous welding. The higher heat input of twin spot resulted in a higher fraction of reverted austenite after PWHT at 480 ºC for 3 h and reduced mechanical properties compared to pulsed Nd:YAG welding. The presence of contamination and misalignment has been found to have a profound impact on weld integrity. Pulsed Nd:YAG welding is the preferred process due to the large operating window, small amount of reverted austenite and excellent weld geometry...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1970 by Joe Montgomery and Murdock MacGregor to {{manufacture}} precast concrete housing. Later Ron Davis came to Cannondale from CBS Laboratories where he was VP {{in charge of the}} development of microfilm reproduction. Ron, a polymath and a gifted mechanical designer/inventor, had ideas for an internal combustion engine that would use ammonia as fuel. Such a concept, if proved, could have far-reaching effects in warfare logistics and middle-eastern politics. Davis, with MacGregor as assistant, had some surprising success. They managed to duplicate and exceed results obtained by Allison Engine, then a division of General Motors. Faced with a commitment to invest a large amount of capital to take the project to a workable model installed in an automobile, Joe decided that the company should raise capital by developing and marketing other products that they had conceived. By now MacGregor and Davis had recruited two more CBS Laboratory alumni: John Wistrand, an award-winning Industrial Designer, and Jim Catrambone, a rising management star. A highly advanced air conditioner with no moving parts was a first effort. Then Joe Montgomery, after a camping bike trip with his son, conceived the Bugger bicycle trailer. Ron Davis devised the under-seat hitch, a torsion spring made of Lexan. Wistrand designed the cloth bags and cargo carrier on the two models of trailers. Joe, in an effort repeated in numerous products, sourced the cloth components, and ensured perfection in their manufacture. A trip to the Bicycle Show in New York was an eye opener. The team was besieged by bike dealers wanting to buy the bags. They bought trailers too, but really wanted the bags. In less than six months Cannondale became the world's largest manufacturer of lightweight bicycle bags. Using a marketing plan devised by Montgomery, Cannondale swept across the US, securing orders from more than 2500 dealers in less than 20 months. They then used the infrastructure developed to produce the bags to enter the camping goods market with backpacks and tents. When Todd Patterson, another exceptional designer/inventor, came aboard and developed the process for <b>jigging</b> and <b>welding</b> aluminum bike frames Cannondale became a serious manufacturer of bicycles. One of the most successful products was the Bugger, a child trailer, although Cannondale's marketing department claimed to be unaware of the connotations of the name in British English (some were, nevertheless, exported to the UK). Today, Cannondale produces many different types of high-end bicycles, which are no longer hand-made in the US. They specialize in aluminum (rather than steel or titanium) and carbon fiber frames, a technology in which they were pioneers. The name of the company was taken from the Cannondale Metro North train station in Wilton, Connecticut.|$|R
