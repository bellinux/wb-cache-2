30|$|As {{positions}} disappear, {{the rate}} at which workers arrive at employers rises, but {{the rate at}} which workers find new vacancies drops. As noted above, the higher arrival rate of workers at vacancies lowers the cost of discriminating, because a faster arrival of the next worker means less foregone output when a type B worker is turned away 14. This lowers the cutoff value of c*, which in turn lowers the value of search for type B workers relative to type A workers. A similar effect results from disproportionately more type A than type B workers losing jobs, raising the share of type A workers among the searchers and lowering the expected waiting time for the next type A applicant for firms who turn away type B workers. The lower arrival rate of job offers to workers lowers the value of search for both type A and type B workers, which lowers the wage of both types; but it lowers the value of search more for type A workers. This decreases the wage gap, but is a rather subtle, non-intuitive effect, as are the impacts of the many of the subsequent equilibrating reactions of the model’s variables to the <b>initial</b> events <b>set</b> in <b>motion</b> by a fall in x.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology for the determination of injection molding processing parameters for defect-free parts. The proposed methodology consists of two parts: <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> and defect correction. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme uses a simplified approach to estimate the processing window within the operating region of the process. The processing window is estimated by using a set of quality criteria in conjunction with a simplified process model. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> of the processing parameters is selected within the simplified processing window based on the minimum cycle time criterion. The defect correction scheme uses a qualitative approach to provide corrective actions if defects are existed after <b>initial</b> <b>setting.</b> A defect-free quality criteria is developed for this purpose. The corrective actions are guided by a qualitative search algorithm in conjunction with a knowledge base for defect correction. Results are presented to verify the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme and the defect correction scheme against numerical results of a commercial numerical simulation package C-MOLD. Results show that the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme is able to provide a reasonable initial estimate of the processing parameters, while the defect correction scheme is able to search the processing parameters to correct the violated quality criteria. The proposed methodology is further verified experimentally for a film-gated plate with two polymers, polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP). Experimental results for PS show that the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme generates a set of defect-free processing parameters. Results for PP shows that corrective actions are necessary after <b>initial</b> <b>setting,</b> and the defect correction scheme is able to correct the defects...|$|R

40|$|Connected {{dominating}} set based routing is {{a promising}} approach for enhancing the routing efficiency in the mobile ad hoc networks. However, finding the minimum dominating set in an arbitrary graph is an NP-complete problem. Restricted Rule k is a localized algorithm for finding a small dominating set in mobile ad hoc networks. It {{starts with a}} large <b>initial</b> dominating <b>set</b> and uses the local information of all neighbors of a node to attempt to remove the node from the set.

The room temperature influences water temperature for mixing alginate impression materials. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the functional relationship of room temperature and <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginate impression materials. Methods: The New Kromopan® alginate (normal and fast sets) were used. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time were tested at 23 (control), 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 degrees Celcius room temperatures (n = 5). The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time was tested based on ANSI/ADA Specification no. 18 (ISO 1563). The alginate powder was mixed with distilled water (23 / 50 ratio), put in the metal ring mould, and the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time was measured by test rod. Data were statistically analyzed by linear regression (α = 0. 05). result: The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> times were 149. 60 ± 0. 55 (control) and 96. 40 ± 0. 89 (31 ° C) seconds for normal set, and 122. 00 ± 1. 00 (control) and 69. 60 ± 0. 55 (31 ° C) seconds for fast set. The coefficient of determination of room temperature to <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginate were R 2 = 0. 74 (normal set) and R 2 = 0. 88 (fast set). The regression equation for normal set was Y = 257. 6 – 5. 5 X (p < 0. 01) and fast set was Y = 237. 7 – 5. 6 X (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The room temperature gave high contribution and became a strength predictor for <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginates. The share contribution to the setting time was 0. 74 % for normal set and 0. 88 % for fast set alginates. </span...|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

After the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> of the cement due to the conversion of TTCP and DCPA into apatite, α-TCP dissolved to supply calcium and phosphate ions and they were consumed for crystal growth of apatite. Therefore, mechanical strength of the apatite cement containing α-TCP was increased.
