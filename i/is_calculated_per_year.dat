40|$|Epidemiology of rare {{cutaneous}} malignancies in {{the general}} population is poorly documented. This descriptive study aimed to estimate the incidence and trends of all skin malignancies between 1989 and 2005. Data on skin tumors were extracted from the Netherlands Cancer registry (except for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) dataonly available from Comprehensive Cancer Centre South) and categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition, codes. Age-standardized incidence rates (European standardized population rate, ESR) per 100, 000 person-years <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> and for the period between 2001 and 2005. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were estimated by Poisson regression models. A total of 356, 620 skin tumors were diagnosed between 1989 and 2005. Excluding BCC, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma, the remaining skin tumors constituted about 2 % of all skin malignancies. The incidence of melanoma showed the steepest increase (EAPC, 4. 0 %), and ESR was close to that observed for SCC (EAPC, 2. 3 %) between 2001 and 2005 (17. 1 versus 19. 6). Hematolymphoid tumors (ESR 0. 74) were mainly cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (60. 8 %). No significant increases in incidence were observed for lymphomas, and appendageal, fibromatous, and myomatous carcinomas during 1989 - 2005. In addition to keratinocytic cancers and melanoma, there is a wide variety of skin tumors that constitute < 2 % of all skin malignancies.

40|$|We {{developed}} two indicators {{to assess}} the exposure of residents to agricultural pesticide use and applied it in a case-control study on bladder cancer {{in the province of}} Limburg, Belgium. The first indicator used a distance-weighted measure of crop area for specified crops (fruit trees, fruit bushes and vegetables). The second indicator used a distance-weighted measure of pesticide use. We used information at three scale levels: (a) information at individual's level, such as distance to crop fields; (b) information {{at the level of the}} municipality, such as time-series of crop area; and (c) regional information, such as pesticide use. Pesticide use data were available per group of pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators and group of other pesticides). Indicators <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> for each individual in the case-control study. The indicators <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> for a period of 20 years, taking into account address history. Variation of pesticide use and toxicity with time was addressed by a relative risk factor. A very strong correlation was found between the area of fruit trees and bushes and the use of fungicides as well as the use of "other pesticides", indicating that these groups of pesticides are predominantly used in fruit production. The indicator for fruit trees is highly skewed to the right, indicating a high number of subjects with low potential exposure to fruit trees. Pesticide pressure indicators are less skewed as they combine application to multiple crops; the highest skewness is found for fungicides corresponding with the distribution for fruit trees. Statistical analysis revealed no association between the indicators and the incidence of bladder cancer. The results show that, using GIS, it is possible to reconstruct potential environmental pesticide exposure accounting for changes in pesticide use, crop area and residence history. Validation of the method with measured exposure is considered essential in view of its future application in other studies. status: publishe...|$|R

To address this information gap, we present an approach to evaluate the temporal consistency of biodiversity hotspots in large marine ecosystems. Using a large scale, public monitoring dataset collected over an eight year period off the US Pacific Coast, we developed a methodological approach for avoiding biases associated with hotspot delineation. We aggregated benthic fish species data from research trawls and calculated mean hotspot thresholds for fish species richness and Shannon's diversity indices over the eight year dataset. We used a spatial frequency distribution method to assign hotspot designations to the grid cells annually. We found no areas containing consistently high biodiversity through the entire study period based on the mean thresholds, and no grid cell was designated as a hotspot for greater than 50 % of the time-series. To test if our approach was sensitive to sampling effort and the geographic extent of the survey, we followed a similar routine for the northern region of the survey area.

40|$|ObjectivesLate {{survival}} is similar after open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR), despite a perioperative benefit with EVAR. AAA-related reinterventions {{are more common}} after EVAR, whereas laparotomy-related reinterventions are more common after open repair. The effect of reinterventions on survival, however, is unknown. We therefore evaluated the rate of reinterventions and readmission after initial AAA repair, 30 -day mortality, and the effect on long-term survival. MethodsWe identified AAA-related and laparotomy-related reinterventions for propensity score-matched cohorts of 45, 652 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing EVAR and open repair from 2001 to 2004. Follow-up was up to 6 years. Hospitalizations for ruptured AAA without repair and for bowel obstruction or ventral hernia without abdominal surgery were also recorded. Event rates <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> and <b>are</b> presented through 6 years of follow-up as events per 100 person-years. Thirty-day mortality <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> for each reintervention or readmission. ResultsThrough 6 years, overall reinterventions or readmissions were similar between repair methods but slightly more common after EVAR (7. 6 vs 7. 0 / 100 person-years; relative risk [RR], 1. 1; P <. 001). Overall 30 -day mortality with any reintervention or readmission was 9. 1 %. EVAR patients had more ruptures (0. 50 vs 0. 09 [RR, 5. 7; P <. 001]), with a mortality of 28 %, but these were uncommon. EVAR patients also had more AAA-related reinterventions through 6 years (3. 7 vs 0. 9 [RR, 4. 0; P <. 001]; mortality, 5. 6 %), {{most of which were}} minor endovascular reinterventions (2. 4 vs 0. 2 [RR, 11. 4; P <. 001]), with a 30 -day mortality of 3. 0 %. However, minor open (0. 8 vs 0. 5 [RR, 1. 4; P <. 001]; mortality, 6. 9 %) and major reinterventions (0. 4 vs 0. 2 [RR, 2. 4; P <. 001]; mortality, 12. 1 %) were also more common after EVAR than open repair. Conversely, EVAR patients had fewer laparotomy-related reinterventions than open patients (1. 4 vs 3. 0 [RR, 0. 5; P <. 001]; mortality, 8. 1 %) and readmissions without surgery (2. 0 vs 2. 7 [RR, 0. 7; P <. 001]; mortality 10. 9 %). Overall, reinterventions or readmission accounted for 9. 6 % of all EVAR deaths and 7. 6 % of all open repair deaths in the follow-up period (P <. 001).

Survival is negatively affected by reintervention or readmission after EVAR and open surgery, which likely contributes to the erosion of the survival benefit of EVAR over time...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) during {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} an increased risk of birth defects. Since epilepsy itself is also associated with potential risks for mother and child, an optimal AED treatment is needed. Over the past years, the introduction of new AEDs and the amendments of guidelines have changed the use of AEDs in this vulnerable group of patients. The extend of the changes over time in the Netherlands has not been studied before. Objectives: To compare the use of different AEDs in pregnant women over the past 10 years in the Netherlands. Methods: This retrospective cohort study data is based on data from the register that is being used to submit Dutch cases to the EURAP study. Pregnancies were included in which women were exposed to an AED between January 2003 and December 2012 either preconceptionally or during the first trimester. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare the proportion of various AEDs annually. Dependent variable was the year in which conception took place; the AED and type of epilepsy were covariates. In addition, the mean number of concomitantly used AEDs <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> and analyzed by ANOVA. Results: A total number of 1, 733 pregnancies in were included in the analysis. The proportion of use of levetiracetam and lamotrigine showed an upwards trend from 6. 2 and 16. 0 % in 2003 till 25. 0 and 33. 5 % in 2012, with corresponding adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 4. 89 (95 % CI 2. 65 - 9. 06) and 2. 77 (95 % CI 1. 76 - 4. 34) respectively. The proportion of use of valproate and carbamazepine decreased from 28. 4 and 28. 4 % in 2003 till 9. 3 and 17. 3 % in 2013, with an adjusted OR of 0. 28 (95 % CI 0. 16 - 0. 48) and from 0. 44 (95 %CI 0. 28 - 0. 70) respectively. The use of other miscellaneous AEDs decreased from 20. 9 % to 14. 9 %, OR 0. 61 (95 %CI 0. 38 - 0. 98). The average number of AEDs being used was 1. 30 in 2003 and 1. 24 in 2012 (p> 0. 05).

5000|$|To measure AADT on {{individual}} road segments, traffic data is collected either by an automated traffic counter or hiring an observer to record traffic. There {{are two different}} techniques of measuring the AADTs for road segments. One technique is called continuous count data collection method. This is where sensors are permanently embedded into a road and traffic data is measured all 365 days. The AADT would be {{the sum of the}} total traffic for the entire year divided by 365 days. There is a problem with calculating the AADT with this method. The continuous count equipment is not operating for the full 365 days due to being shut down for maintenance or repair. Because of this, seasonal or day-of-week biases might skew the calculated AADT. In 1992, AASHTO released the AASHTO Guidelines for Traffic Data Programs, which identified a way to produce an AADT without seasonal or day-of-week biases by creating an [...] "average of averages."

We assessed healthcare utilization and work impairment of patients before, during, and after long-term psychoanalytic treatment (N = 231). Our results show that the difference in total costs associated with healthcare utilization and work impairment between pre-and post-treatment was (sic) 2, 444 (U.

However, we cannot conclude that all invested costs will be earned back eventually. More research is needed on the cost-effectiveness of psychoanalytic treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar as ações de vigilância de contatos de casos novos de tuberculose em Mato Grosso no período de 1999 a 2004. MÉTODOS: Estudo epidemiológico descritivo baseado em dados do Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação-Tuberculose. O número de casos novos de tuberculose, o número de contatos (estimados, examinados e não examinados) e a taxa de incidência de tuberculose foram analisados segundo a faixa etária. Calculou-se, por ano de estudo, a média de contatos examinados para cada caso de tuberculose segundo a faixa etária. Os casos de tuberculose pulmonar com e sem contatos examinados foram analisados segundo o resultado da baciloscopia. RESULTADOS: Em 2004, Mato Grosso apresentou 41, 3 casos de tuberculose por 100 mil habitantes. A mesorregião centro-sul apresentou a maior taxa de incidência (57 casos/ 100 mil habitantes) e uma taxa de 15 % de contatos examinados. Entre os menores de 15 anos, examinaram-se 63 contatos (60, 5 %), enquanto entre aqueles com 15 anos ou mais, examinaram-se 389 contatos (8, 9 %). Em 1999, a média de contatos examinados em Mato Grosso foi de 0, 02 (0, 5 %), e, em 2004, ela alcançou 0, 42 (10, 5 %). O percentual de contatos examinados foi 40, 0 % maior entre os contatos de casos bacilíferos (OR = 1, 4; IC 95 %: 1, 08 - 1, 83). CONCLUSÕES: O percentual de contatos examinados é muito baixo, principalmente entre os adultos. A normatização do exame de contatos de tuberculose pela Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde do Ministério da Saúde não tem sido suficiente para garantir que esse grupo de maior risco de adoecimento seja priorizado pelos serviços de saúde de Mato Grosso. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{surveillance of}} contacts of new tuberculosis {{cases in the}} state of Mato Grosso from 1999 to 2004. METHODS: This was a descriptive epidemiological study based on data from the Tuberculosis Case Registry Database. The number of new tuberculosis cases, the number of contacts (estimated, investigated, and uninvestigated), and the tuberculosis incidence rate were analyzed by age bracket. The mean rate of contacts investigated for each case of tuberculosis by age bracket <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> of study. The cases of pulmonary tuberculosis with and without contacts investigated were analyzed by sputum smear microscopy results. RESULTS: In 2004, there were 41. 3 cases of tuberculosis per 100, 000 inhabitants {{in the state of}} Mato Grosso. The south-central region presented the highest incidence rate (57 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants) and a 15 % rate of contacts investigated. Among those younger than 15 years, 63 contacts (60. 5 %) were investigated, whereas among those aged 15 or older, 389 (8. 9 %) were investigated. In 1999, the mean rate of contacts investigated statewide was 0. 02 (0. 5 %), and, in 2004, it reached 0. 42 (10. 5 %). The percentage of contacts investigated was 40 % higher among the contacts of contagious cases (OR = 1. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 1. 83). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of contacts investigated is very low, principally among adults. The adoption of the standards for investigation of tuberculosis contacts proposed by the Brazilian National Ministry of Health Department of Health Surveillance has not ensured that this group at highest risk of developing active tuberculosis be given priority at health care facilities in the state of Mato Grosso...|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} the incidence rates (IRs) of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders {{in the general}} population according to sociodemographic population characteristics. A cohort study (during the years 1996 - 2007) was conducted in a general practitioners research database with a longitudinal electronic record of 800000 patients throughout the Netherlands [the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database]. Cases of bipolar disorder were identified and classified by systematic review of medical records. Age- and gender-specific IRs <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> calendar <b>year,</b> degree of urbanization, and degree of deprivation. The overall IR of bipolar disorder was 0. 70 / 10000 person-years (PY) [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 57 - 0. 83]; the IR of bipolar I disorder was 0. 43 / 10000 PY (95 % CI: 0. 34 - 0. 55) and the IR of bipolar II disorder was 0. 19 / 10000 PY (95 % CI: 0. 13 - 0. 27). Two peaks in the age at onset of the disorder were noticed: one in early adulthood (15 - 24 years; 0. 68 / 10000 PY) and a larger peak in later life (45 - 54 years; 1. 2 / 10000 PY). In bipolar II disorder, only one peak, in the 45 - 54 year age category (IR 0. 42 / 10000 PY), was found. The IRs of bipolar disorder were significantly higher in deprived areas. Similar rates were found for men compared to women and in urban compared to rural areas. No association was found between the onset of first (hypo) manic episode and month or season of birth. We found two peaks in the age at onset of bipolar disorder, one in early adulthood and one in later life, the former consisting mainly of bipolar I disorder subjects. The incidence of bipolar disorder is higher in deprived areas. The onset of bipolar disorder is not associated with gender, urbanization, or month or season of birt...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The optimal age {{boundaries}} {{for breast}} cancer screening are still under debate. A case-referent design was {{used to describe the}} effect of mammographic screening on breast cancer mortality along the continuum of age, based on a 20 year follow up period. SETTING: The population based breast cancer screening programme in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, which has biennially invited women over 35 years since 1975. METHODS: Cases, defined as women who died from primary breast cancer between 1987 and 1997, were selected from the group of women who received at least one invitation to the screening programme. For 157 cases, 785 women from the same group were selected as referents. Information on the index screening (the screening examination preceding diagnosis of the case) was collected for both cases and referents. The risk of dying from breast cancer <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> 10 <b>year</b> moving age group for women who had attended the index screening versus those who had not. RESULTS: The youngest 10 year age group showing an effect in our study were women aged 45 - 54 at their index screening. Breast cancer mortality for women in this group who attended the index screening was 32 % lower, although not significant, than for women who did not (odds ratio (OR) 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 33 to 1. 41). This reduction in risk was not explained solely by an effect in women over 50 because the OR in women aged 45 - 49 was 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 20 to 1. 61). Reductions in mortality became smaller with increasing age. Nevertheless, for women over 60 at index screening, participation in screening over a maximum 4 year period before diagnosis of the case yielded protective effects at least up to an age around 80. CONCLUSIONS: Although our results are based on {{a relatively small number of}} cases, they suggest that even in a programme with a 2 year screening interval there may be a benefit of starting screening around age 45. Also older women who participate at least once every 4 years still have much to gain from screening...|$|R
50|$|Yield {{in college}} admissions is {{the percent of}} {{students}} who choose to enroll in a particular college or university after having been offered admission. It <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> by dividing {{the number of students}} who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The yield rate <b>is</b> usually <b>calculated</b> once <b>per</b> <b>year</b> based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the yield rate for Princeton University was 69% in 2016, while the yield rate for Dartmouth was 55%, and the yield rate for Colorado College was 37%. The yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the Wall Street Journal by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the US News college ranking.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} factors {{driving the}} economic burden of {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) patients with different treatment regimens, by evaluating the relationship between medical profiles and treatment costs. Abstract: Methods: Claims data for US privately insured employees (1999 - 2004) were analysed. Analysis included adult employees with ≥ 1 diagnosis of MDD and ≥ 1 prescription for specific antidepressants following a 6 -month washout period. Patients were first classified into treatment pattern groups (switchers/discontinuers/maintainers/augmenters), then stratified into mutually exclusive treatment groups - nonstable, stable and intermediate - based on evidence of stability in treatment therapy. Rates of mental and physical co-morbidities, injuries/accidents, substance abuse and urgent care use were analysed across treatment pattern groups. Direct (medical/drug) costs <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> patient <b>per</b> <b>year</b> and disaggregated into depression- and non-depression-related components. A two-part multivariate model controlled for baseline characteristics. Costs were also estimated for patients with MDD only, patients with MDD and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and patients with MDD and any type of anxiety. Abstract: Results: Annual per patient adjusted costs (year 2005 values) were significantly lower among stable patients ($US 6215) than among intermediate ($US 7317) and nonstable patients ($US 9948; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Stable patients also had lower depression- and non-depression-related costs. Patients with MDD and comorbid GAD or any type of anxiety had significantly higher costs than MDD-only patients. Abstract: Conclusions: Nonstability of treatment is associated with higher comorbidity rates, more urgent care use and higher total, depression- and non-depression-related direct costs. The stable group represents continuity of care and is associated with significant cost savings. Co-morbidities are associated with increased costs. ...|$|R

We assessed the incidence of HIV- 1 and associated risk factors in a general population FFC to determine population-wide HIV rates. Methods: A community-based cohort study was conducted among {{a random sample of}} 2191 participants aged 18 – 49 years. At baseline and 12 months post-baseline, data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics and risky behaviors (including number of partners, new partners, condom use, use of alcohol and illicit drug use). Venous blood was collected for HIV serological testing. HIV incidence <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> 100 person <b>years</b> at-risk (pyar) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (Adj.

Results: Overall follow up at 12 months was 76. 9 % (1685 / 2191) and was significantly higher among HIV uninfected persons and those with at least 1 year duration of stay in community. Overall HIV- 1 incidence was 3. 39 / 100 pyar (95 % CI: 2. 55 – 4. 49). Among the 25 – 29 years who drank alcohol, HIV incidence was 7. 67 / 100 pyar (95 % CI; 4. 62 – 12. 7) while it was 5. 67 / 100 pyar (95 % CI; 3. 14 – 10. 2) for 18 – 24 year olds who drank alcohol.

Although the designer surgeons have achieved good results with the Oxford UKA there is concern over the reproducibility of these outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated published long-term outcomes of the Oxford Phase 3 UKA. Patients and methods - We searched databases to identify studies reporting ≥ 10 year outcomes of the medial Oxford Phase 3 UKA. Revision, non-revision, and re-operation rates <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> 100 component <b>years</b> (% pa). Results - 15 studies with 8, 658 knees were included. The annual revision rate was 0. 74 % pa (95 % CI 0. 67 - 0. 81, n = 8, 406) corresponding to a 10 -year survival of 93 % and 15 -year survival of 89 %. The non-revision re-operation rate was 0. 19 % pa (95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 25, n = 3, 482). The re-operation rate was 0. 89 % pa (95 % CI 0. 77 - 1. 02, n = 3, 482). The most common causes of revision were lateral disease progression (1. 42 %), aseptic loosening (1. 25 %), bearing dislocation (0. 58 %), and pain (0. 57 %) (n = 8, 658). Average OKS scores were 40 at 10 years (n = 3, 417). The incidence of medical complications was 0. 83 % (n = 1, 443). Interpretation - Very good outcomes were achieved by both designer and non-designer surgeons. The PROMs, medical complication rate, and non-revision re-operation rate were better than those found in meta-analyses and publications for TKA but the revision rate was higher. However, if failure is considered to be all re-operations and not just revisions, then the failure rate of UKA was less than that of TKA...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{robustness}} of {{epidemiological research}} using routinely collected primary care electronic {{data to support}} policy and practice for common mental disorders (CMD) anxiety and depression would be greatly enhanced by appropriate validation of diagnostic codes and algorithms for data extraction. We aimed to create a robust research platform for CMD using population-based, routinely collected primary care electronic data. Methods We developed a set of Read code lists (diagnosis, symptoms, treatments) for the identification of anxiety and depression in the General Practice Database (GPD) within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank at Swansea University, and assessed 12 algorithms for Read codes to define cases according to various criteria. Annual incidence rates <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>per</b> 1000 person <b>years</b> at risk (PYAR) to assess recording practice for these CMD between January 1 st 2000 and December 31 st 2009. We anonymously linked the 2799 MHI- 5 Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey (CHSNS) respondents aged 18 to 74 years to their routinely collected GP data in SAIL. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the various algorithms using the MHI- 5 as the gold standard. Results The incidence of combined depression/anxiety diagnoses remained stable over the ten-year period in a population of over 500, 000 but symptoms increased from 6. 5 to 20. 7 per 1000 PYAR. A ‘historical’ GP diagnosis for depression/anxiety currently treated plus a current diagnosis (treated or untreated) resulted in a specificity of 0. 96, sensitivity 0. 29 and PPV 0. 76. Adding current symptom codes improved sensitivity (0. 32) with a marginal effect on specificity (0. 95) and PPV (0. 74). Conclusions We have developed an algorithm with a high specificity and PPV of detecting cases of anxiety and depression from routine GP data that incorporates symptom codes to reflect GP coding behaviour. We have demonstrated that using diagnosis and current treatment alone to identify cases for depression and anxiety using routinely collected primary care data will miss a number of true cases given changes in GP recording behaviour. The Read code lists plus the developed algorithms will be applicable to other routinely collected primary care datasets, creating a platform for future e-cohort research into these conditions.

40|$|Contagious bovine {{pleuropneumonia}} (CBPP) {{caused by}} Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides (small colony) is an insidious pneumonic disease of cattle and poses {{a challenge to}} cattle production in sub-Saharan Africa. It is transmitted by direct contact and can manifest as peracute, acute or chronic disease. It {{has been described as}} one of the trans-boundary animal diseases of cattle known to pose trade barriers throughout many countries in Africa (Jores et al., 2013). This study describes the occurrence of CBPP in the northern communal areas (NCA) of Namibia from 2001 to 2013. All the data was collected from annual reports at the epidemiology section of the Division of Veterinary Services. The annual reports captured all outbreak foci together with their GPS coordinates and this facilitated the analysis of temporal and spatial occurrence of the disease. The suspected cases that were not confirmed at the laboratory but had clinical manifestation typical of CBPP were also recorded. A total of 70 outbreaks were recorded from 2001 to 2013. The highest number of outbreaks was recorded in 2005 with 11 laboratory confirmed outbreaks. Zambezi and Kunene North regions were the most affected. From 2002 to 2004, six outbreaks were recorded for each year and in 2006 eight outbreaks were reported. It's important to note that from 2007 up to 2012; isolated outbreaks with less than five laboratory confirmed cases were recorded. Measures of risk including incidence and mortality rates, as well as vaccination coverage of the population at risk <b>were</b> <b>calculated</b> and described <b>per</b> <b>year</b> for each of the different regions in the NCA. CBPP is confined to the NCA especially in regions that share open border with Angola and Zambia. Zambezi, Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Omusati, Kunene and Kavango are the hot spots of CBPP in the NCA. Despite good vaccination coverage, outbreaks still occurred hence the disease cannot be eradicated with annual vaccinations alone. Other factors such as the open border between Namibia and Angola that facilitates free movement of animals between the two countries have to be addressed first.
