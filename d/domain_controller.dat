This can improve startup times on machines that are disconnected from the company network. [...] New Group Policy settings have been added to cover new features in Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11, such as enabling/disabling SPDY/3 support, configuring start screen layouts, and detecting phone numbers in web pages.|$|E

2500|$|Windows 8 has {{introduced}} a new feature called Group Policy Update. This feature allows an administrator to force a group policy update on all computers with accounts in a particular Organizational Unit.

50|$|In general, {{a network}} {{utilizing}} Active Directory {{has more than}} one licensed Windows server computer. Backup and restore of Active Directory is possible for a network with a single <b>domain</b> <b>controller,</b> but Microsoft recommends more than one <b>domain</b> <b>controller</b> to provide automatic failover protection of the directory. Domain controllers are also ideally single-purpose for directory operations only, and should not run any other software or role.|$|E
5000|$|The PDC {{emulator}} master receives preferential {{replication of}} password changes within the domain. As password changes {{take time to}} replicate across all the domain controllers in an Active Directory domain, the PDC emulator master receives notification of password changes immediately, and if a logon attempt fails at another <b>domain</b> <b>controller,</b> that <b>domain</b> <b>controller</b> will forward the logon request to the PDC emulator master before rejecting it.|$|E
5000|$|The Schema Master - The {{purpose of}} this role is to {{replicate}} schema changes to all other <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> in the forest. Since the schema of Active Directory is rarely changed, however, the Schema Master role will rarely do any work. Typical scenarios where this role is used would be when you deploy Exchange Server, Skype for Business Server, or when you upgrade <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> from one version to another version, as all of these situations involve making changes to the Active Directory schema.|$|R
50|$|By default AD assigns all {{operations}} master {{roles to}} the first DC created in a forest. To provide fault tolerance, there {{should be at least}} 2 <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> available within each domain of the Forest. If new domains are created in the forest, the first DC in a new domain holds all of the domain-wide FSMO roles. This is not a satisfactory position if an active directory has a large number of <b>domain</b> <b>controllers.</b> Microsoft recommends the careful division of FSMO roles, with standby DCs ready to take over each role.|$|R

50|$|Physical {{hardware}} {{costs for}} the many separate servers can be reduced {{through the use of}} virtualization, although for proper failover protection, Microsoft recommends not running multiple virtualized <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> on the same physical hardware.|$|R
50|$|Physically, the Active Directory {{information}} is held {{on one or}} more peer <b>domain</b> <b>controllers,</b> replacing the NT PDC/BDC model. Each DC has {{a copy of the}} Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> are called Member Servers. A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> that are configured as global catalogs. Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.Global Catalog servers replicate to themselves all objects from all domains and hence, provide a global listing of objects in the forest. However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC. Earlier versions of Windows used NetBIOS to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires TCP/IP—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support SRV resource records, also known as service records.|$|R
50|$|In Microsoft Windows networks, dynamic DNS is an {{integral}} part of Active Directory, because <b>domain</b> <b>controllers</b> register their network service types in DNS so that other computers in the domain (or forest) can access them.|$|R
