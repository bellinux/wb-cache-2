40|$|Resource {{exploitation}} and behavioural interference underlie competition among carnivores. Competition {{is reduced by}} specializing on different prey and/or spatiotemporal separation, usually leading to different food habits. We predicted that two closely related species of large cats, the endangered snow leopard and the near-threatened common leopard, living in sympatry, would coexist through habitat separation and exploitation of different prey species. In central Himalaya, we assessed (2006 – 2010) habitat and diet overlap between these carnivores. The snow leopard used grassland and shrubland, whereas the common leopard selected forest. Contrary to our prediction, snow leopard and common leopard preyed upon similar wild (<b>Himalayan</b> tahr, <b>musk</b> <b>deer)</b> and domestic species (Bos spp., dogs).

50|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> {{are found}} in parts of {{northern}} Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and in northern parts of India such as in (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh).

50|$|Kedarnath Wild Life Sanctuary, {{also called}} the Kedarnath Musk Deer Sanctuary, is a {{national}} sanctuary in Uttarakhand, India. Its alternate name comes from its primary purpose of protecting the endangered <b>Himalayan</b> <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Consisting of an area of 975 km2, {{it is the largest}} protected area in the western Himalayas. It is internationally important for the diversity of its flora and fauna (particularly of ungulate species).|$|E
50|$|Common larger mammals are <b>Himalayan</b> <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> {{mainland}} serow and Himalayan tahr. Goral are {{not found}} within, {{but in the}} vicinity of the park. Carnivores are represented by snow leopard, Himalayan black bear and perhaps also brown bear. Langurs are found within the park, whereas rhesus macaque are known to occur in the neighboring areas of the park. In a scientific Expedition in 1993, a total of 114 bird species was recognized.|$|E
50|$|The Great Himalayan National Park {{is home to}} {{more than}} 375 faunal species. So far species of 31 mammals, 181 birds, 3 reptiles, 9 amphibians, 11 annelids, 17 mollusks and 127 insects {{belonging}} to six orders have been identified and documented. Most of the Himalayan fauna has been given protection under the high priority protection category of Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The state government of Himachal Pradesh has banned hunting in the state for more than ten years. A trek of 35 to 45 km in any of the park's valleys brings one into the high altitude habitat (3,500 m and above) of animals such as blue sheep, snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, <b>Himalayan</b> tahr, and <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Best sightings can be made in autumn (September-November) as animals start their seasonal migration to lower altitudes.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary during 2012, a year before the major natural disaster took place in Himalays. Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary is situated in Chamoli district of Uttrakhand Himalayas covering an area of 975 sq km. A total of 28 mammalian species were reported from this sanctuary. However, scientific information on many of these mammals are scanty and there is a gap of knowledge regarding their status, distribution and ecology. Considering this, an attempt was made to study sambar, alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> <b>himalayan</b> tahr, asiatic black beer and red fox found in Shokharak area of Kedarnath WLS. Direct as well indirect methods were used to assess the population and habitat use. Twenty four trail-transect of different length were laid throughout the study area and monitored three times, covering 43 km in 124. 50 hours. The overall encounter rate (group/km) among different species was recorded maximum for Himalayan Tahr (0. 208 group/k. m) and Tugnath was the place where its density was maximum (31. 83 ± 13. 59). The pattern of habitat use by different species revealed that <b>Himalayan</b> Tahr, alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> and Asiatic black bear prefer high altitude areas therefore they are found in Shokhark, Tungnath and Chandrasila, whereas, sambar and red fox prefer middle altitude and because of this their presence was not recorded from above mentioned areas. A further investigation is needed to understand the post disaster impact on the abundance and habitat use of mammals in Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary.

No humans live in the Park which has remained more or less intact because of its rugged inaccessibility. It has a very diverse flora and is the habitat of several endangered mammals, among them the snow leopard, serow, <b>himalayan</b> <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> and bharal.
