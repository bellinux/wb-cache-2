25|$|The {{style is}} also often {{associated}} in Argentina with the californiano ("Californian"), another vernacular type of house close {{connected with the}} American mission style. Mar del Plata's features, however, {{are closely related to}} the picturesque architecture, already popular among the upper-class people who used to spend summertime in this resort city between 1910 and 1930, and to the American craftsman style. The precursor of the style was the Italian-born engineer Alula Baldassarini, who popularized the use of stone on the frontispieces in 1925. Some of this early examples were labeled chalet <b>inglés</b> ("English chalet"), a type of bungalow or cottage which flourished between 1925 and 1935.

5000|$|<b>Ingle</b> {{grew up in}} {{the travel}} {{insurance}} industry. Following the end of World War II, immigrants new to Canada who were not financially established were denied policies by insurance companies. Social healthcare coverage did not exist at the time. [...] In 1946, <b>Ingle’s</b> parents, John and Muriel <b>Ingle,</b> founded John <b>Ingle</b> Insurance which offered insurance for new immigrants to Canada, an idea inspired by the family’s immigrant background and an obvious consumer need. Muriel <b>Ingle</b> {{was one of the first}} licensed insurance women in Ontario.|$|R
25|$|Because of its {{strategic}} location between the Indian nations, who alternately were {{allies of the}} French and British as it suited them, plus its location through gaps into the Alleghenies further west, the area's development was viewed with increasing apprehension by the French and their Indian allies. In July 1755, during the French and Indian War, hostile Shawnee Indians equipped and armed by France attacked the frontier outpost at Draper's Meadow, then still consisting of a small encampment with around twenty pioneer settlers. About four settlers {{were killed in the}} attacks, and five were taken captive to Kentucky by the Shawnee, among them Mary Draper <b>Ingles,</b> who later escaped. The memorial to Draper's Meadow massacre was dedicated on a bridge located near Duck Pond. By the end of the war, Draper's Meadow was deserted.|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, <b>Ingles,</b> Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's cash card, debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E

500|$|In late 1975 J.

Even as Amtrak and EMD investigated the ride quality, the SDP40F {{was involved in a}} series of derailments which would culminate in an abrupt end to its career as a passenger locomotive. Between 1974–1976 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) identified thirteen separate incidents for which the locomotive was responsible. While none of the incidents were serious, their frequency was a major concern. Most of the derailments occurred on trains with two SDP40Fs on the front and at least one trailing baggage car. While the rear truck of the second locomotive and the front truck of the baggage car were pinpointed as the source of the derailment, the actual cause of the derailments was unclear.|$|E

500|$|Amtrak ordered {{its first}} 30 F40PHs on May 8, 1975; {{the first of}} the new {{locomotives}} entered service on April 9 the following year. Amtrak intended the locomotives for short routes such as the San Diegan in California and Northeast Corridor services between New Haven, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts. The long-distance routes were protected by the then-new EMD SDP40F, described by J. David <b>Ingles</b> in late 1975 as the [...] "stars of Amtrak's long-distance trains". Two events led to a major change in thinking within Amtrak. The first was a sharp decline in the mechanical reliability of the EMD SDP40F, including several derailments. The second was the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches, designed for short runs, into service. The F40PH, with its built-in HEP generator, was the natural choice to haul these trains.|$|E
