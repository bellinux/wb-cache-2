40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{impeller}} construction, non contact driving method and performance of a newly developed shaftless floating pump with centrifugal impeller. The drive principle of the <b>floating</b> <b>impeller</b> pump used the magnet induction method similar to the levitation theory of the linear motor. In {{order to reduce the}} axial thrust by the pressure different between shroud and disk side, the balance hole and the aileron blade were installed in the <b>floating</b> <b>impeller.</b> Considering the above effect, floating of an impeller in a pump was realized. Moreover, the performance curves of a developed pump are in agreement with a general centrifugal pump, and the dimensionless characteristic curve also agrees under the different rotational speed due to no mechanical friction of the rotational part. Therefore, utility of a non contacting magnetic-drive style pump with the <b>floating</b> <b>impeller</b> was made clear...|$|E
40|$|To meet {{energy-saving}} and environment-protective purpose, {{a series}} of plastic pumps are developed by composite molding. There are four key techniques involved, firstly, plastic hydraulic components with light-weight; secondly, steel barrel as a pump casing and a connection component as well; thirdly, <b>floating</b> <b>impeller</b> strategy where impeller is drifting freely along shaft; and lastly, a self balancing impeller technique which can totally keep axial force balancing. The manufacturing process is energy-saving, and the components can be recycled, which have great potentials for conservation of environment...|$|E
40|$|The Gyro {{centrifugal}} pump {{developed as a}} totally implantable artificial heart was designed with a free impeller, in which the rotational shaft (male bearing) of the impeller was completely separated from the female bearing. For this type of pump, {{it is very important}} to keep the proper magnet balance (impeller-magnet and actuator-magnet) in order to prevent thrombus formation and/or bearing wear. When the magnet balance is not proper, the impeller is jerked down into the bottom bearing. On the other hand, if magnet balance is proper, the impeller lifted off the bottom of the pump housing within a certain range of pumping conditions. In this study, this floating phenomenon was investigated in detail. The floating phenomenon was proved by observation of the impeller behavior using a transparent acrylic pump. The impeller floating phenomenon was mapped on a pump performance curve. The impeller floating phenomenon is affected by the magnet-magnet coupling distance and rotational speed of the impeller. In order to keep the proper magnet balance and to maintain the impeller floating phenomenon at the driving condition of right and left pump, the magnet-magnet coupling distance was altered by a spacer which was installed between the pump and actuator. It became clear that the same pump could handle different conditions (right and left ventricular assist), by just changing the thickness of the spacer. When magnet balance is proper, the <b>floating</b> <b>impeller</b> phenomenon occurs automatically in response to the impeller rev. It is called "the dynamic RPM suspension"...|$|E
