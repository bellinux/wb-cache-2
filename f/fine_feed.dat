40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in mechanical separation is the feeding of the sample. The most desirable feeder should be continuously variable, and capable of providing very fast or very slow feeds. Those used here, both for the isodynamic separator and the mica separator, are essentially similar to those described by Faul and Davis (1959), with the difference that they are made from brass and have exchangeable plugs with dif-ferent sizes of orifice (fig. 1). They are made from 1 in. diam. thin-walled brass tube, with a push-fit plug that has a shallow polished conical base. in. diam. holes were used for general purposes; smaller or larger holes may better suit particular problems. The feeders are attached to 6 -volt or 24 -volt relays, controlled by small variable potentiometers. Faul (personal communication) suggests the use of aluminium hoppers and there is probably little difference between the two. When feeding fine material below 200 mesh, {{the presence of a}} 1 ~ in. brass rod bevelled at 60 ~ as shown, to fit the cone {{at the base of the}} feeder, results in a <b>fine</b> <b>feed</b> of material and prevents clumping or stoppage.

40|$|The {{production}} of ferrochrome is an energy intensive process. At present, the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process {{is most likely}} the ferrochrome production process with the lowest specific energy consumption, i. e. MW h/t ferrochrome produced. Higher chromite pre-reduction levels correspond to lower specific energy consumptions. It was previously proven that various compounds could enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction. In this paper the effect of CaCO 3 addition on pelletised chromite pre-reduction is presented. CaCO 3 (as limestone) is already used as a flux in some FeCr production processes, hence its use does not constitute the addition of an extra raw material. Results indicated that CaCO 3 addition enhance the level of chromite pre-reduction achieved significantly, which could results in substantial specific energy consumption improvements. However, CaCO 3 addition caused severe decreases in both compressive and abrasion strengths of pre-reduced pellets, which {{is unlikely to be}} negated by mitigation measures. The addition of CaCO 3 in the pelletised chromite pre-reduction process is therefore likely to result in the formation of excessively <b>fine</b> <b>feed</b> materials. In practise, this reduces the usefulness of this technique for submerged arc furnace ferrochrome production significantly, since excessive fines in the feed material are likely to result in increased operational instabilities, equipment damage and safety risks. TGA and thermochemical calculations also indicated that CO 2 released from the CaCO 3 will result in in situ carbon and energy consumption, which is an additional negative associated with its use as an additive during pre-reduction of composite chromite pellets. Although this paper was not specifically aimed at obtaining mechanistic information, thermo-mechanical analysis indicated that especially iron pre-reduction rates were enhanced by CaCO 3 addition.

40|$|Correct feeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the production of colts. Feed is the largest single item of expense, and any reduction that can be made in the amount required to grow colts to working age is of economic importance to the farmer. During the period 1929 - 1930 prices of common feeds were extremely high, and as a consequence the cost of producing colts was increasing. Horse breeders had long since learned from experience that scant feeding of colts was not economical when the ultimate results were considered. The poorly fed colt was slow maturing, undersized and its usefulness for work may have been affected. The question of preparing feeds in an effort to reduce feed requirements per 100 pounds of gain or increase the rate of gain on a given amount of feed is considered to be important by farmers.

The principal aim of this thesis is to investigate whether column flotation {{can be used to}} recover saleable, particularly low-ash quality, coal from South African coal fines which are presently discarded. Samples of thickener underflow fines from the Durnacol, Kleinkopje and Greenside Collieries were used in laboratory column testwork. In addition, on-line column trials were performed at the Kleinkopje Colliery. The effects of co 1 umn operating parameters were established using both one-variable-at-a-time testing and fractional factorial design experiments. An investigation into coal slurry conditioning using oil and oil-water dispersions was also undertaken. The results of laboratory and plant column testwork showed {{that it was possible to}} recover the desired quality products from all three of the coal fines samples investigated. For all the coals tested, better grades were obtained at any given yield from column cell flotation than with conventional (batch) froth flotation. The test results also demonstrated that the column cell is best suited to recovering and upgrading the finer (< 75 μm) size fractions. Column performance was found to be strongly affected by the petrographic composition of the coal <b>fines</b> <b>feed,</b> i. e. by coal TYPE. Coals with high vitrinite and, conversely, low inertinite contents were found to be the most easily floatable. Depending on the coal TYPE, the rate of mass transport in either the pulp or froth phase was found to be rate limiting; this in turn dictated which operating parameters affected product yields and grades. Existing methods of conditioning coal slurries were found to be inadequate. Considerable scope for improvement in coal conditioning lies in better choice of collector and "promotor" reagents as well as in designing more energetically efficient conditioning vessels...|$|R

In {{the process}} some 15 % of the Nb is rejected in a slimes ($-$ 10 $ mu$m) product. Recovery of pyrochlore from the slimes was studied. The study was performed using plant water which contained about 200 ppm Ca, 100 ppm Mg and variable quantities of organics {{as the main}} contaminants. Selective pyrochlore collectors and selective silicate depressants were evaluated. Four possible routes to float pyrochlore selectively were found. All routes required prior carbonate flotation. Carbonate flotation was attempted using fatty acids and sodium silicate dispersant (as conducted at Niobec) in a flotation column. However, pyrochlore also floated {{as a result of}} inadequate dispersion of the slimes. Therefore, new dispersants were tested, which proved effective only at high concentration, because reaction with Ca and Mg cations in the water. High dispersant concentration caused carbonate depression. An additional problem in the flotation column was bubble coalescence and collapse of the froth. This was caused by the fatty acids, enhanced by the high dispersant concentration. A novel method of quantifying coalescence using the change in gas holdup in the column was developed. A stable froth could be made at high fatty acid emulsifier concentration, but his promoted unselective flotation. Only by working at high percent solids (10 % vs 1 %) could sufficient emulsifier be introduced into solution without exceeding the dosage (per unit mass of solids) above which flotation is unselective. For such high percent solids work must be conducted at plant site. Preliminary plant column work was encouraging.

In 1992, three cost-shared contracts were awarded to industry, under the first High-Efficiency Preparation (HEP I) solicitation. All three projects involved bench-scale testing of various emerging technologies, at the Federal Energy Technology Center*s (FETC*s), Process Research Facility (PRF). The first HEP I project, completed in mid- 1993, was conducted by Process Technology, Inc., with the objective of developing a computerized, on-line system for monitoring and controlling the operation of a column flotation circuit. The second HEP I project, completed in mid- 1994, was conducted by a team led by Virginia Polytechnic Institute to test the Mozely Multi-Gravity Separator in combination with the Microcel Flotation Column, for improved removal of mineral matter and pyritic sulfur from fine coal. The last HEP I project, of which the findings are contained in this report, was conducted by Custom Coals Corporation to evaluate and advance a micronized-magnetite-based, fine-coal cycloning technology. The micronized-magnetite coal cleaning technology, also know as the Micro-Mag process, is based on widely used conventional dense-medium cyclone applications, in that it utilizes a finely ground magnetite/water suspension as a separating medium for cleaning fine coal, by density, in a cyclone. However, the micronized-magnetite cleaning technology differs from conventional systems in several ways: !

The difficulties of milling such heterogeneous material, especially when plastic-rich, have to be overcome to allow such chemical analyses. To tackle this aspect, plastic-rich fluff sampled from the process line of an industrial waste management centre was subjected to pilot float separation (d = 134) and cryogenic ball milling at BRGM. The cryogenic milling, tested in terms of plastic-rich fluff density, grinding time and feed size, was found to reach an acceptable final particle size (81 - 98 % of particles at < 250 mu m) to allow total digestion and accurate and repeatable elemental analyses after a grinding time of between 27 min and 2 x 27 min (iterative two-step process). The results are contrasted, the milling being more efficient with the heavier fractions of plastic-rich fluff and a <b>finer</b> <b>feed</b> size. The varied grindability of the different fractions could result {{from a combination of}} {{one or more of the}} following effects: (i) a dilution of the plastics by more cryo-grindable rubber, (ii) the action of remnant minerals and non-ferrous metals as milling agents, (iii) the inherent cryo-grindability of various types of plastics, and (iv) the potential action of mineral and metallic fillers as weakening agents. The elemental analyses of our case study allowed us to determine a mass balance and show, in particular, that the pilot float separation (i) recovers most of the organochlorine plastics, and (ii) concentrates Cu, Pb, Ba and B in the heavier fraction with respective ratios of 100 : 1, 8 : 1, 6 : 11 and 5 : 1.

40|$|DEM {{models of}} fine {{grinding}} in ball and stirred mills have to date almost entirely {{focused on the}} motion of the media and their interaction with the mill configuration. For SAG mills, a large fraction of the feed material can now be accurately represented in DEM models. However, for other mill types with much <b>finer</b> <b>feed</b> materials, such as the second chamber of a cement ball mill, the vast numbers of feed particles makes their explicit inclusion in the models prohibitive. However, it is now feasible to model a periodic section of a laboratory scale ball mill and include the coarser end of the ore size distribution directly in the DEM model. This provides the opportunity to better understand the effect of media on the interstitial bed of powder and of the effect of the powder on the media. The effect of the powder fill level, which is varied between 0 % and 150 % of the pore space in the media charge, is explored. The distribution of the powder, its effect on power draw {{and the way in which}} it contributes to the pattern of energy utilisation is assessed. The simulation results are compared with experimental results from a test at similar ball loading and rotation rate and for several size fractions of ore at a range of powder fill fractions. Tracking the collision histories of specific ore particles within the charge allows estimates of the probability (per unit time) of collision between media and ore particles (the “Selection” function) and of the intensity of each collision which can be used to estimate the severity of breakage using the JKMRC breakage model (the “Breakage” function). The energy spectra indicate that for a typical ore, only very few collisions are large enough to cause damage to the body of each particle.

In the in vitro trial, the relative gizzard weight was lower in birds that were fed the pellet diet (P < 0. 01), whereas the relative weight of the cecum was higher in these birds (P < 0. 01). Broilers receiving the pellet diet had enhanced concentrations of volatile fatty acids in contents from both the gizzards and the ceca. In addition, {{there was an increase}} in gizzard pH (P < 0. 01) with the pellet diet, but a reduction in ceca...|$|R
