40|$|Football games can be {{won or lost}} "off {{the foot}} " of a kicker. It may be a point after {{touchdown}} (worth 1 point) or a field go 1 (worth 3 points). The keys {{to the success of}} a kick depend on the strength/power of the kicker's leg and the accuracy with which he can kick the ball through the uprights. Strength and power in the kicking leg can be gained through a well-designed weight training program. Accuracy can be developed through the knowledge and application of proper mechanics in the kicking motion. Consistency in scoring points comes with repetitious practices. The de cription of the biomechanics of kicking in football has been documented in the literature (Becker, 1963; Bunn, 1972; Dodd, 1954; Marshall, 1958; Roberts and Metcalfe, 1968).

The risk level is divided into five levels: low risk (V 1), medium low risk (V 2), general risk (V 3), medium high risk (V 4), and high risk (V 5). The above five evaluation rank elements constitute the evaluation level set V={V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4, V 5 }. For the six weights of the evaluation indicators, we used the Delphi method to issue a consultation letter to 10 experts (including scholars, business leaders, and managers) and scored the weight of six sub-sets of evaluation indicators.|$|R

40|$|Immigrant {{numbers in}} {{developing}} and first world countries are increasing, and immigrants are bringing {{with them to the}} host country their set of attitudes, customs, habits, interests and traditions. Due to this influx of immigrants, conflict situations between employees are on the rise and are more difficult to resolve when compared to conflicts that are within the same cultural groups. If organizations are better able to understand the relationship between the cultural beliefs and conflict management styles of employees, they can help them utilize conflict management styles in specific situations to result in increased job satisfaction and job performance. This collected papers dissertation explored the relationship between U. S. Jamaican immigrants’ cultural beliefs, and conflict management styles related to perceived job satisfaction and job performance. There were two studies completed in fulfillment of this collected papers dissertation. STUDY # 1 : The purpose of this structured literature review was to systematically examine the literature on conflict management style and perceived job satisfaction and job performance. STUDY # 2 : The purpose of this cross-sectional, explanatory {{study was to examine the}} relationship between the cultural beliefs and conflict management <b>styles</b> of <b>U.</b> S.

It was found in study # 1, that the two conflict management styles that were associated with increased job satisfaction and job performance with were integrating and compromising conflict management styles (Zhang et al., 2015). In study # 2, it was found that the dominant conflict management <b>style</b> for <b>U.</b> S. Jamaican immigrants was collaborating. However, the only conflict management style that was found to be a significantly positive moderator for the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance was compromising conflict management style.

40|$|Purpose: Effective {{styles of}} {{principal}} leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low {{student achievement and}} high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain “idealized ” leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transactional, transformational, instructional and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals {{may or may not}} choose to practice these <b>styles</b> across <b>U.</b> S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify different types of principals across the U. S. We analyzed the 1999 - 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U. S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys or administrations. A final sample of 7, 650 public schools and principals were included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance and principal background, helped to predict each of the three significantly different principal types: Controlling, frequent principal leadership, Balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers, or Integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context. These findings provide support for the use of more complex models to assess school leader effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a systematic study of (U–Th) /He ages of volcanic zircons of known eruption age {{to establish a}} reliable protocol for zircon He dating and to validate the resulting ages. Using laser He extraction and dissolution by lithium borate flux melting we analyzed many aliquots of single zircon grains separated from four rapidly cooled rocks: Fish Canyon Tuff (accepted age 27. 8 ± 0. 7 Ma), Buluk Tuff (16. 3 ± 0. 2 Ma), Tardree Rhyolite (58. 4 ± 0. 7 Ma) and Utaosa Rhyolite (2. 52 ± 0. 02 Ma). He ages of Fish Canyon Tuff, Buluk Tuff and Utaosa Rhyolite zircons are in good agreement with their reference ages: mean α emission-corrected ages were 28. 6 ± 1. 4 (1 σ), 16. 1 ± 0. 8 and 2. 61 ± 0. 18 Ma, respectively. However, the zircon He ages of Tardree Rhyolite are irreproducible and consistently too old, with a mean He age of 78. 8 ± 7. 0 Ma. Spontaneous fission track densities of Tardree Rhyolite zircons indicate that about 80 % of these zircons are strongly zoned in U, with high track density (i. e., high U content) in the core and low density on the rim. This causes an overestimation of the α ejection correction that likely explains the erratic and excessively high He ages from these zircons. Assessment of the degree and <b>style</b> of <b>U</b> zonation within a zircon population is thus prudent before application of the (U–Th) /He method. Step-heating experiments indicate that for most zircons He extraction is > 99 % complete after ∼ 1 h at 1300 °C. However, for as yet unknown reasons occasional grains seem to retain substantial amounts of He under these conditions...|$|R
40|$|CERN COMPASS plans {{measurements}} of gamma-pi and gamma-K interactions using 50 - 280 GeV pion (kaon) beams and a virtual photon target. Pion (kaon) polarizabilities and radiative transitions will be measured via Primakoff effect reactions such as pi+gamma->pi'+gamma and pi+gamma->meson. The former can test a precise prediction of chiral symmetry; the latter for pi+gamma->a 1 (1260) {{is important for}} understanding the polarizability. The radiative transition of a pion to a low mass two-pion system, pi+gamma->pi+pi 0, can also be studied to measure the chiral anomaly amplitude F(3 pi) (characterizing gamma-> 3 pi), arising from the effective Chiral Lagrangian. We review here the motivation for the above physics program. We describe the beam, target, detector, and trigger requirements for these experiments. We also describe FNAL SELEX attempts to study related physics via the interaction of 600 GeV pions with target electrons. Data analysis in progress aims to identify the reactions pi+e->pi'+e'+pi 0 related to the chiral anomaly, and pi+e->pi'+e'+gamma related to pion polarizabilities.

40|$|The equity style {{orientation}} of an institutional portfolio {{has a large}} influence on its yearly returns. This paper analyzes the causes and consequences of portfolio <b>style</b> drift among <b>U.</b> S. equity mutual funds by developing new portfolio holdings-based measures of drift. These holdingsbased measures allow a decomposition of style drift into components that result from active versus passive portfolio decisions by a fund manager in three different equity style dimensions: size, bookto-market, and price momentum. We find that {{a significant amount of}} style drift results from active manager trades, therefore, managers that trade more frequently tend to manage portfolios with greater style drift. In addition, managers of growth-oriented funds and small funds, and managers having good stockpicking track records, tend to have higher levels of style drift than other managers; these managers also deliver better future portfolio performance {{as a result of their}} trades, even after accounting for their higher trading costs. Consistent with this superior performance, managers do not seem to be concerned with controlling style drift; indeed, managers tend to be style chasers during most years, which appears to benefit their performance. Overall, our findings suggest that controlling the style drift of a fund manager does not necessarily result in higher performance for investors...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{continuous}} advances with globalization and overall competition, small U. S. machining and fabrication companies (manufacturing) {{are required to}} constantly maintain a competitive advantage to stay relevant (Avolio, 2004; Cascio 1995). To help maintain that competitive advantage, leadership has been extensively researched for many years within multiple segments of the U. S. economy; however, specific focus has been neglected {{when it comes to}} transactional and transformational leadership <b>styles</b> within small <b>U.</b> S. industrial machining and fabricating companies. The focus of this research centers on three small industrial machining and fabricating businesses in the manufacturing sector. Distributing the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) this research investigates the leadership style of each businesses leader. The MLQ specifically focuses on the leadership styles that the leaders self-assess between transactional and transformational leadership and then leverage that information when the employees provide a 360 -loop feedback, which rates the leader. The MLQ is the gold-star standard to evaluate transactional and transformational leadership (Bass 2 ̆ 6 Avolio, 2000; Avolio 2 ̆ 6 Bass, 2004). The MLQ additionally provides a rating on the outcomes of extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction from both the subordinates and leader, which this dissertation will focus on as well. Previous studies provide a solid foundation on transactional and transformational leadership within alternative environments other than small U. S. industrial machining and fabricating companies, which is the focus of this dissertation. This dissertation presents the findings that employees in an industrial environment would exhibit higher levels of extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction, provided the leader espouses more transformational leadership. Results revealed transformational leadership was significantly related to extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction. To the contrary, results revealed that transactional leadership was not significantly related to extra effort, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Additional results substantiated the findings listed above by conducting a Person correlation that showed transformational leadership scores were positively related to transactional leadership scores. To substantiate the study further results were compiled by conducting three fixed effect regressions analyzing the independent variables of transactional and transformational leadership scores from the employee self-reports, as well as one-sample t-tests that compared this studies MLQ results to the U.
