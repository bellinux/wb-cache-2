5|$|The Himalayas lies in {{the north}} {{of the state and the}} Bay of Bengal is at the south. In between them, the river Ganga flows eastwards and its main <b>distributary,</b> the Hooghly River, flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal. The Siliguri Corridor, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, {{lies in the}} North Bengal region of the state. Geographically, West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions—Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, Terai and Dooars region, North Bengal plains, Rarh region, Western plateau and high lands, coastal plains, Sunderbans and the Ganga Delta.|$|E
5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have <b>distributary</b> channels of sand and terrigenous material.|$|E
25|$|A <b>distributary,</b> or a <b>distributary</b> channel, is {{a stream}} that {{branches}} off and flows {{away from a}} main stream channel. They are a common feature of river deltas. The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation. The opposite of a <b>distributary</b> is a tributary. Distributaries usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor <b>distributary</b> can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.|$|E

50|$|Before {{entering}} the Coral Sea, the river's delta splits into three <b>distributaries,</b> the main river channel, Thomatis/Richters Creek and Redden Creek. During times of flooding two other <b>distributaries</b> also operate - Barr Creek and Half Moon Creek.|$|R
50|$|A large {{alluvial}} fan has formed where the river's gradient decreases in the Central Valley so the river divides into <b>distributaries.</b> Southern <b>distributaries</b> enter the endorheic basin surrounding Tulare Lake while northern <b>distributaries</b> join the San Joaquin River, eventually reaching San Francisco Bay via the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Tulare Lake was formerly {{one of the}} largest freshwater lakes in western North America, but heavy water diversions have left it dry except in years of exceptionally heavy runoff.|$|R

50|$|River {{bifurcation}} (from furca, fork) {{occurs when}} a river flowing in a single stream separates into two or more separate streams (called <b>distributaries)</b> which continue downstream. Some rivers form complex networks of <b>distributaries,</b> especially in their deltas. If the streams eventually merge again or empty into the same body of water, then the bifurcation forms a river island.|$|R

25|$|Before {{the late}} 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly <b>distributary</b> {{was the main}} channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the Adi Ganga. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma {{channels}} {{were more or less}} equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges. It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main <b>distributary</b> of the Ganges. One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Common {{terms to}} name {{individual}} river distributaries in English-speaking countries are arm and channel.

25|$|In some cases, {{the length}} of the Ganges is given for its Hooghly River <b>distributary,</b> which is longer than its main outlet via the Meghna River, {{resulting}} in a total length of about , from the source of the Bhagirathi, or , from Haridwar to the Hooghly's mouth. In other cases the length is said to be about , from the source of the Bhagirathi to the Bangladesh border, where its name changes to Padma.|$|E
25|$|In the Ganges Delta {{many large}} rivers come together, both merging and bifurcating in a {{complicated}} network of channels. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, both split into <b>distributary</b> channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have changed course, sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.|$|E

In addition, {{there are}} occasional backwaters and artificial cuts that form islands, <b>distributaries</b> (most numerous {{in the case}} of the Colne), and man-made <b>distributaries</b> such as the Longford River. Three canals intersect this stretch: the Oxford Canal, Kennet and Avon Canal and Wey Navigation.|$|R
5000|$|The Atchafalaya River {{is one of}} {{the major}} <b>distributaries</b> in the Mississippi River System. It spans across 170 miles, making it one of the longest <b>distributaries</b> of the Mississippi River. The name of the river {{translated}} into English is [...] "long river," [...] which derives from the Native American word. The river is important for commerce because it shortens the distance to the Gulf of Mexico, also saving companies time and money.|$|R
