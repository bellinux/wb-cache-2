40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{distributed}} Raptor code design over <b>information</b> <b>packets</b> located across the network nodes. We propose a novel approach to this problem that consists of generating, encoding and dispersing Raptor packets across the network. Unlike recent node-centric proposals, where network nodes are responsible for collecting <b>information</b> <b>packets</b> and performing Raptor encoding, in the proposed packet-centric approach this task is assigned to Raptor packets. In a two-step encoding procedure that corresponds to precoding and LT-coding step of standard Raptor encoding, Raptor packets randomly traverse the network, collect and encode sufficient number of <b>information</b> <b>packets</b> following exactly a given degree distribution, and finish their paths in a random network node. The efficiency of the distributed Raptor coding scheme is confirmed by simulation results, where their performance is demonstrated to approach closely the performance of standard (centralized) Raptor codes.

With Blaine's aid, Maturin obtains letters of marque so she can operate as a private man-of-war. Aubrey takes Surprise out immediately. Blaine tells Maturin that there is interest in a mission to Chile, and that Maturin is the preferred agent. Maturin receives a message to meet someone who mentions the Blue Peter, the diamond that Diana gave up to gain Maturin's release in France. He again meets M. Duhamel, who returns the diamond as long ago agreed, and supplies Maturin with information on the double agents in London. Duhamel knew the late Palmer only by that alias, and the pair in government is Ledward and Andrew Wray, who also mounted the stock exchange fraud. Maturin is chagrined when he realizes what he did not understand in Malta, when dealing with Wray. In return, Duhamel wants to leave Europe for Canada, as he is tired of the war. Maturin arranges for him to sail on HMS Eurydice under Captain Dundas, leaving in a few days.

5000|$|Undermatching is {{considered}} as a serious issue in higher education, and it is getting increased attention from education researchers and policymakers. Undermatching can affect long-term economic inequality and social mobility, and it can negatively affect college graduation rates. According to one view, minority and less-affluent students have substantially lower graduation rates and take longer on average to get degrees when they do stay in school. Low college graduation rates are {{a problem in the}} United States; one estimate is that fewer than 60% of high school graduates manage to earn a bachelor's degree, {{which is one of the}} worst completion rates of developed nations. The problem of undermatched students has attracted the attention of the executive branch. Proposals to reduce undermatching include making it easier to transfer between colleges, making financial aid policies more transparent, and helping students identify colleges that will challenge them academically, possibly by sending high-achieving low-income seniors an <b>information</b> <b>packet</b> about college choices. According to a report by NBC News in 2014, some elite colleges such as Williams strive actively to bring bright low-income students by supporting them financially but these colleges can find themselves pressed to make up the shortfall by seeking out more full-paying students; as a result, students at such colleges tend to be mostly affluent with some low-income students but few from the middle class, which reporter Nona Willis-Aronowitz described as a [...] "middle class squeeze".|$|E
