Feelings – novel, satisfying, intense, prolonged, challenging or transcendent – are sought by bungee jumpers, mountaineers and practitioners of ‘extreme’ sports; by millions of consumers of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and other recre- ational drugs; by users of pornography, music and painkillers; and by consumers at festivals, carnivals, fairgrounds, music events, cinemas and sports stadia. The management of feeling is integral to identities that are both gendered (‘big boys don’t cry’) and cultural (‘keep a stiff upper lip’) and emphasised by advice to ‘keep a cool head’ to make unbiased, ratio- nal decisions. Simultaneously, the fabric of everyday relating includes countless conversations that begin with some reference to feeling (“So, how are you today?”), conversations of which a sizeable minority take feeling as their primary focus (“I’m sorry I upset you”). In fact, the ubiq- uity and relevance of feeling is such that sometimes it is even parodied (“so – how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> ?”) [First paragraph]Peer-reviewedPost-print...|$|E

40|$|As an {{interpersonal}} profession, {{operating within}} and between amyriad of nebulous psycho-social worlds, a significant proportion ofsocial work's currency resides in emotion, providing impetus for actionor omission. This paper asserts that due diligence must be exercisedtowards emotion within social work training and practice, givingconsideration to the journey towards qualification, fraught as it canbe; emphasising the need to bring emotion {{out of the shadows}} andinto the light. This is not simply a ‘how <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel?' task,rather one of acknowledgement and acceptance, which lends itselfto an exploration of the layered interface where emotion comes intobeing, prodded and poked, twisted and contorted, by the powerfulforces of politics, sensationalism and reductionism, which seek toorchestrate simplicity and control...|$|R
6000|$|Now, my friends, to {{make the}} matter simpler, I will take you at your words, {{for the sake of}} argument. Suppose you do avoid sin from the fear of hell, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> RIGHT? <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>YOU</b> right? <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> your heart right? It is a great blessing to a man's neighbours, certainly, if he is kept from doing wrong any how-- by the fear of hell, or fear of jail, or fear of shame, or fear of ghosts if you like, or any other cowardly and foolish motive--a great blessing to a man's neighbours: but no blessing, that I can see, to the man himself. He is just the same; his heart is not changed; his heart is no more right in the sight of God, or in the sight of any man of common sense either, than it would be if he did the wrong thing, which he loves and dare not <b>do.</b> You feel <b>that</b> yourselves about other people. You will say [...] "That man has a bad heart, for all his respectable outside. He would be a rogue if he dared, and {{therefore}} he IS a rogue." [...] Just so, I say, my friends, take care lest God should say of you, [...] "He would be a sinner if he dared, and therefore he is a sinner.|$|R

How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel?" [...] Kurt Warner: [...] "Everybody's going to be tired of hearing this, but I never get tired of saying it. There's one reason that I'm standing up on this stage today. That's because of my Lord up above. I've got to say thanks to Jesus; you knew I was going to do it, but I've got to do it. And secondly, I've gotta say thanks to you guys (motioning to the Arizona fans); when nobody else believed in us, when nobody else believed in me, you guys did. And we're going to the Super Bowl!" ...|$|R
50|$|Conscious Discipline - Conscious {{discipline}} targets {{the brain}} to help children {{know exactly what the}} authoritative figure wants. This includes talking to the children with phrases such as “how <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel?” and “I noticed you looked upset, what happened?” These phrases help the children understand that their parent/caretaker respect them and care about what they have to say. When a parent/caretaker accuses the child of doing something without knowing exactly what happened, this may cause a bad reaction within the emotional state of the child. Getting the children to do what the parent/caretaker wants is a bit difficult being the children usually have minds of their own and are in their own little worlds. If a child is doing an unsafe act, the parent/caretaker should tell the child that said activity is unsafe, and instead they should try an alternative activity that is safe and just about the same thing. For example, if the child is standing on a chair, the parent/caretaker should tell the child “standing on the chair is unsafe, instead, why don’t you sit on the chair or stand on the floor.” This will tell the child exactly what the parent/caretaker wants.|$|R

5000|$|The {{title of}} the album arose out of a vision Mould had, [...] "of when people leave or things end, of {{something}} shooting through the 'fabric of the sky' and disappearing.

500|$|In the release, Steven Grover, BK Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance, {{confirmed}} the factuality of the QSR report {{and that if}} the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re being asked to <b>do</b> something <b>that</b> we have legal questions about. We {{want to find a}} way to <b>make</b> sure <b>that</b> workers are protected and receive a decent wage." [...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> any more innocent? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound?" ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{has been}} met with {{critical}} acclaim {{since it has}} aired and {{is considered one of}} the best episodes of The Office by many critics. Travis Fickett of IGN wrote that [...] "this is one of those great episodes of The Office that is hysterical and difficult to watch at the same time." [...] He noted that this was largely due to the fact that [...] "it's not because of something Michael is <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> wince. It's because of what's happening to him." [...] He ultimately gave the episode an 8.9/10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. Jay Black of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] was happy The Office was back" [...] but [...] "the only thing [...] worried about was whether it'd still be good" [...] after the writers strike. However, he noted that his fears were put to rest and that [...] "Dinner Party" [...] was [...] "a Barry Bond's-style [...] chemically enhanced mega-home-run." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded this episode with an [...] "A." [...] Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly said that her favorite moment of the episode [...] "was when Jan popped on that song by her former assistant, Hunter." ...|$|R

5000|$|Rose Troche, a Latina {{director}} {{teamed up}} with her then partner and co-writer to finance on their own an experimental lesbian feature. It was the first film {{to be sold to}} a distributor during the Sundance Film Festival. With the small amount of approximately $8000, started their road to a Samuel Goldwyn $450,000 sale. Help along the way with Vachon's company Killer Films who contributed $5000 when funds ran out and John Pierson bankrolled the remaining $53,000. “Troche’s Latina identity was (problematically) written out of the marketing campaign and the film was promoted on the basis of her gender and sexuality.” The film was released during gay pride month in June 1994 and eventually grossed $2.4 million. Go Fish proved the marketability of lesbian issues for the film industry. Troche mentioned that during the filming of Go Fish (1994), at one point she didn’t have money to pay her phone and electric bills. The film also put a label on her and critics considered her [...] "a professional queer", a fact that she sometimes hated: [...] "Go Fish made me such a card-carrying member. It is, like, boring. I go into interviews for Bedrooms and Hallways and all anyone can talk about is being gay, gay, gay." [...] "If you're gay, and you sleep with someone of the opposite sex, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> straight? Troche muses afterward. [...] "I've done it, and I don't consider myself straight at all." ...|$|R

40|$|Mediators {{have shown}} great ambivalence about emotions, with {{practice}} lurching between intrusive fascination (“How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel?”) and denial (one prominent pioneer describing emotional information as “not useful”). Emotions are also physical, and mediation has also proved itself less than {{comfortable with the}} physical dimensions of human interaction. The classic model involves sitting, talking and thinking – “mediating from the neck up. ” And yet all know the visceral effect of conflict. Bodies matter: “Our evaluations of the world … rely on a seamless calibration of feelings and thoughts. Body and mind are equally implicated” The chapter explores three key ideas: 1) The relationship between cognition and emotion in perception 2) The importance {{of a range of}} emotions, starting with anger, in contributing to conflict 3) The potential for emotional self-regulation to be harnessed and supported by mediators It goes on to set out the “emotion grid”, a simple heuristic with twin poles of volume and intensity, designed to support conflict resolution practitioners in: 1) developing cultural fluency 2) plotting the flow of emotions over time 3) developing mediator practice through self-reflection 4) helping clients build their capacity for emotional self-regulation. This chapter emerged from “Dancing at the Crossroads”, an innovative conference led by Michelle LeBaron and Margie Gillis (one of Canada’s best known contemporary dancers). Conflict resolution practitioners and artists from across the world gathered in Switzerland in the summer of 2013 to engage in an imaginative experiment in creativity and physicality, culminating in the publication of “The Choreography of Resolution: Conflict, Movement, and Neuroscience. ” The “emotion grid” was one of the products of that week...|$|R
5000|$|For Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, {{the album}} touches on {{everything}} from the expected Latin rhythms to glitzy Euro disco, trashy American rock & roll, and stomping Britpop, all punctuated by some stark confessionals. [...] "How Do You Do" [...] is a bold opening track that features Gregorian chants and an eerie reciting of [...] "The Lord's Prayer" [...] before thrusting the listener into a song similar to Sarah McLachlan's 'Dear God', according to Kristina Weise of Songwriting Universe. It presents bitter questions regarding faith and religion. The lyrics say, [...] "How many people die and hurt in your name?/Hey <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> proud, or <b>does</b> it bring you shame?" [...] Shakira affirms, [...] "I decided in {{the bridge of the}} song to include chants from different religions like Islam, Judaism and Christianity. And the three chanters are saying basically the same: they are asking for forgiveness," [...] she said off the track. The first single, [...] "Don't Bother", presents the final chapter of a relationship and the confusion that faces anyone in a break up. It includes the lyric lines, [...] "For you I'd give up all I own and move to a communist country/If you came with me, of course/And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you." [...] She quickly follows with: [...] "And after all I'm glad I am not your type/I promise you won't see me cry/So don't bother/I'll be fine, I'll be fine." [...] For Shakira, [...] "I think 'Don't Bother' has a lot of pain in it as a song, but also a lot of humor and sarcasm. Yes, {{it is a way of}} exorcising all of these feelings, a form of catharsis, getting rid of all of those emotions that torture us women at some point in our lives." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wakin on a Pretty Daze {{features}} {{songs with}} longer tracks lengths than on previous releases, with Vile noting, [...] "It {{was just the}} next logical step from making succinct pop songs. What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> after <b>that?</b> <b>You</b> <b>make</b> pop songs <b>that</b> are longer and more epic, that push the envelope. Imagine your favourite song, or something that you play over and over in the car, except that you don't have to start it over as much." ...|$|R
