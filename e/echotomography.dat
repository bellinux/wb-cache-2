40|$|The {{positive}} correlation between cerebral ischemia and carotid atherosclerosis of extracranial tract has been well established. The reliability of <b>echotomography</b> as diagnostic and prognostic tool {{in the evaluation of}} the carotid atherosclerotic lesions is now intensively investigated. Most of the attention has been payed to the accuracy in the determination of the carotid stenosis. A percentage of cerebrovascular accidents do not correlate to the vascular stenosis but to the other modifications induced by the atherosclerotic plaque, such as the release of emboli, acute stenosis for intraplaque haemorrhage or thrombosis. Thus the evaluation of the composition of the plaque may represent a good prognostic tool. In the present study, fifty-two carotid obtained at surgery from patients, who preoperatively underwent ultrasonographic scanning of both carotid arteries, were examined by histological methods.

40|$|Great {{progress}} has been realised {{in the field of}} biliary obstruction diagnosis, thanks to new technics of investigation based on physical means. The efficacy of echography in the diagnosis of intra-abdominal space occupying lesions is already well known. Its possibility of structural analysis permits one to differentiate liquid collections from plain tumors and, thanks to this property, to distinguish a dilated gallbladder and demonstrate the presence of biliary lithiasis when I.

Computerised tomography gives not only good morphologic information on intra-abdominal organs, but measures also some density of parenchyma. It permits one to differentiate a tumor tissue from the normal parenchyma. The biliary tree is easy to distinguish when dilated. Computerised tomography is able to localise the siege of an obstruction of the extra-hepatic biliary tree, as a neoplasm of the head of the pancreas. It helps to demonstrate the absence of any obstruction and to establish the diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice.

40|$|Background/Aim. Transitional cell {{carcinoma}} (TCC) {{is the most}} frequent tumor of the bladder and represents 95 − 98 % of blader neoplasams and 2 − 3 % of all carcinomas in the body. In urogenital oncology more frequent is only prostatic cancer. Evaluation of the depth of infiltration of urothelial carcinoma in the vesical wall represents the clinical base in treatment planning and prognosis. Clinical investigation and convential radiological procedures have {{a low level of}} accuracy in estimating the local growth of the tumor. The aims of our investigation were to determine the depth of infiltration of urothelial carcinoma in the vesical wall in the investigated group of patients by transurethral intravesical <b>echotomography</b> (TIE) and computerised tomography (CT scan) and to compare results obtained by both methods with pathohistological (PH) results, and, based on the difference of the results determine which method was more accurate in the evaluation of the depth of infiltration of urothelial carcinoma in the vesical wall. Methods. Thirty patients with TCC of the bladder both genders, aged 51 − 81 years were involved in our investigation. In all of these patients, radical cystectomy (RC) was performed. This was neccessary to provide the defintive PH result. Transurethral intravesical <b>echotomography</b> was performed by ultrasound scanner type 1846 Bruel and Kjaer, sond type 1850, and the CT scan was perfomed by Pace plus, General Electric, U. S. A. The specimen for the definitive PH result obtained by RC includes all standards of the TNM classification. Results. Using CT scan, the most frequent was T 1 stage (17 patients or 56. 68 %). Using TIE, the most frequent was T 2 stage (22 patients or 73. 33 %). After RC the most frequent was T 2 stage (21 patients or 70 %). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, showed a high significant difference between the results obtained using CT and definitive PH results after RC. The same test showed no statistically significant difference between the results obtained using TIE and definitive PH results. The sensitivity and accurance of TIE compared to definitive PH results was 93. 3 %, but using CT it was only 33. 3 %. Conclusion. There was {{a significant difference between the}} results obtained using CT and TIE. The results obtained by TIE were in closer relation with the definitive PH results than the results obtained by CT scan. TIE provides more precise evaluation of the depth of infiltration of urothelial carcinoma in the vesical wall than CT scan.

40|$|Abstract. The {{inspection}} of components with high safety requirements demands {{the application of}} advanced nondestructive testing techniques as well as modern equipment with the means for data collection and a high storage capability. Furthermore, {{in accordance with the}} component specifications, an objective data evaluation is needed so that human factors are minimised. This can be achieved by data visualisation starting from the “simple ” A-scan presentation with some evaluation tools up to presentations using reconstruction algorithms such as Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). In the past, various evaluation program tools were developed, or optimized in the ultrasonic working groups at BAM, often in connection with modern ultrasonic methods such as the phased array technique. Especially in the field of inspection for heavy components commonly encountered in the nuclear field, advanced evaluation and data presentation programs are necessary for handling the high data rate. The other very important point is the reliability of the evaluation results. In some cases these results are the basis for the quantification of defects using fracture mechanics algorithm.

To reduce the dependency upon amplitude information and {{due to the fact}} that flaw information is buried in the shape and fine structure of wave fronts, considerable attention has been given to the development of methods using time-of-flight information from different probe positions. For this reason, with mechanical scanners and specially build data acquisition and evaluation systems, a vareity of ways to produce images has been developed. These include <b>echotomography,</b> linear or two dimensional mono- or multi-frequency holography, tip echo interference methods, ALOK (amplitude-,time-of-flight-locus curves), Phased Array, SAFT or Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Holography. These methods use mathematical algorithms which seem to be independent or which have been derived heuristically. Based upon the concept of elastodynamic diffraction theory together with that of tomography a concept can be derived which reveals the inner connection of these algorithms. Differences in the reconstructions arise due to limitations like limited aperture, limited bandwidth, use of mode converted signals or due to complex surface shapes.

Results - The patients' mean age was 41 +/- 19. 8 years (range: 4 and 85). The most common cause for consulting a physician was pain (79. 4 %), usually located in the right upper quadrant Sometimes, the disease occurred with the onset of serious complications. In some cases it was also discovered fortuitously. The most sensitive diagnostic method was abdominal <b>echotomography,</b> positive in every case. Serology and TD scan were also performed in some cases. The treatment was surgery with two methods: a radical and a conservative one; 16. 5 % of postoperative complications are reported for both techniques (fistula and surinfection).

Approximately 54. 5 % {{arise in the}} gastrointestinal tract and frequently metastasize to the liver. Primary hepatic carcinoid tumors (PHCT) are extremely rare; only 95 cases have been reported. A 65 -year-old man came to our attention due to occasional ultrasound findings in absence of clinical manifestations. His previous medical history, since 2003, included an <b>echotomography</b> of the dishomogeneous parenchymal area but no focal lesions. A computed tomography scan performed in 2005 showed an enhanced pseudonodular-like lesion of about 2 cm. Cholangio-magnetic resonance imaging identified the lesion as a possible cholangiocarcinoma. No positive findings were obtained with positron emission tomography. Histology suggested a secondary localization in the liver caused by a low-grade malignant neuroendocrine tumor. Immunohistochemistry was positive for anti chromogranin antibodies, Ki 67 antibodies and synaptophysin. Octreoscan scintigraphy indicated intense activity in the lesion. Endoscopic investigations were performed to exclude the presence of extrahepatic neoplasms. Diagnosis of PHCT was established. The patient underwent left hepatectomy, followed by hormone therapy with sandostatine LAR. Two months after surgery he had a lymph nodal relapse along the celiac trunk and caudate lobe, which was histologically confirmed. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful, with a negative follow-up for hematochemical, clinical and radiological investigations at 18 mo post-surgery. Diagnosis of PHCT is based principally on the histopathological confirmation of a carcinoid tumor and the exclusion of a non-hepatic primary tumor. Surgical resection is the recommended primary treatment for PHCT. Recurrence rate and survival rate in patients treated with resection were 18 % and 74 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} urothelial {{inverted}} papilloma, detected in two female patients aged 32 and 31 years, respectively {{and in one}} 67 -year-old male patient, are described. Inverted papilloma is a benign lesion which occurs in the urinary epithelium with a 20 % incidence in comparison with other urothelial tumours. The male:female ratio is 3 : 1. The histological structure of urothelial inverted papilloma {{is similar to that}} of inverted papilloma of the nasal and paranasal sinuses. It presents interanastomosed epithelial cords, with transitional cells, which develop in the tunica propria connective tissue. Some cells are distributed in such a way as to constitute vacuolated glandular-like structures. The histogenetic origin of the lesion from Home subtrigonal or Albarran subcervical glands is debatable. Recent aetiological hypotheses have claimed that the origin of the lesion may be related to Brunn's nest hyperplasia and/or to chronic urothelial inflammation. The latter hypothesis would currently appear to be the most accredited: immunostaining for cytokeratins would tend to support a urothelial inflammatory aetiology. In our cases, we achieved a definitive diagnosis of inverted papilloma only at histology, because of the specificity of the <b>echotomography</b> and cystoscopy findings. Urinary cytology revealed only a large number of inflammatory cells with anaplastic elements, but without any more detailed morphological description. We performed a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in all three patients: routine follow-up showed the absence of inverted papilloma relapses. On the basis of the above-mentioned data and a thorough review of the literature, we attempt to assess and classify the clinico-pathological findings and the aetiological hypotheses of urothelial inverted papilloma. In addition, the benign nature of the lesion and any malignant transformation factors are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In adults the {{diagnosis}} of acute pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis is primarily based on clinical and laboratory-biochemical testing. In patients where the clinical picture atypical, even if a person does not respond to therapy resorts to radiographic examination. Echotomographic examination is unavoidable in the diagnostic algorithm. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the individual echotomographic parameters, as well as to determine their diagnostic power in patients with acute infections (pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis), and comparing them with the appropriate reference tests. Materials and methods: We performed a cross sectional study in the period from October 2014. until May 2015. It included 50 patients with acute inflammation of the kidney which was made echotomographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis, within the Department of Radiological Diagnostics KBC 'Dragisa Mišović-Dedinje' in Belgrade. The echotomographic examination of the kidneys included testing of numerous parameters that could indicate the existence of an acute inflammation of the kidney. For the gold standard, we take the findings obtained by CT (computed tomography) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, as well as histopathological findings obtained by fine needle bio-psy. Results: At 50 patients with acute inflammation of the upper urinary tract, 41 patients (82 %) had acute pyelonephritis, and 9 (18 %) had acute glomerulonephritis. In 70 % of patients with acute pyelonephritis (29 people) were present enlargement of the kidney where the test sensitivity was 79. 3 % and specificity of 91. 7 %. The accuracy of the method was 82. 9 % when the monitored parameters: loss of central echo complex and cortico-medullary differentiation. The sensitivity of the test in which the observed thickening of the pelvic and ureteric wall was 65 % and specificity of 90 %. The analysis of the presence of calculus in renal parenchyma leads to the values of sensitivity test of 54. 8 % and specificity of 80 %. Hypoechoic focus in the renal parenchyma, enlargement of the kidneys and loss corticomedullar limits are parameters who with great sensitivity and specificity suggest acute glomerulonephritis. Conclusion: On the basis of high values of sensitivity and specificity of the test survey estimates that ultrasound has a required place in the following diagnostics algorithm. The use of <b>echotomography</b> that offer the possibility of high resolutive views, as well as the wide availability and good reproducibility of the method, the low cost of inspection, in favor of the first exploration ultrasound examination. Multidetector CT scan and fine needle biopsy remains the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{multicentre}} study involved 28 Italian ORL Centres {{responding to a}} questionnaire sent by us which allowed recruitment of a high large {{number of cases of}} parotid neoplasms observed over a 10 -year period. Statistical data obtained partly confirmed previous findings. Benign tumours account for 80 % of case histories with a relationship 1 : 4 M/F, the most frequent being pleomorphic adenoma (57. 3 % of cases), followed by Warthin’s tumour (32. 4 %), this rating not having been confirmed in case histories (8 - 10 %) in the literature. Malignant tumours instead were fewer in number compared to the literature (14 % vs 25 - 30 %); the most frequent being mucoepidermoid carcinoma (18. 2 %) of which 44 % G 1, 33 % G 2 and 23 % G 3. Adenoid-cystic carcinoma was observed in 15. 3 % and ≤ 10 % for all the other most frequent histological malignant neoplasms. Diagnostic work-up included <b>echotomography</b> and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, less used imaging techniques were computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, Sialo-computed tomography. During this multicentre investigation more widespread use of imaging techniques has, however, been observed. The greater use of ecotomography and of fine-needle aspiration biopsy was due to simplicity of application and low cost offering good sensitivity and specificity. Surgical treatment of benign tumours consisted, in 50 % of cases, in superficial paroditectomy and in ~ 30 % of total paroditectomy. Enucleoresection was limited to ~ 15 % of neoplasms, enucleation to < 10 % of cases with only 2 % of pleomorph adenoma due to the well-known anatomo-pathological characteristics which may lead to relapse. For malignant neoplasms, total parotidectomy was performed in ~ 50 % of cases, while in the remaining 50 % an almost equal rate of superficial parotidectomy was carried out and enlarged parotidectomy, with or without sacrificing the facial nerve, which was rebuilt in 60 % of cases. The lateral neck dissection most frequently carried out was of functional type in 54 % and selective type in 46 % with removal of levels I-III and II-IV in ~ 60 % of cases. Sentinel lymph node was observed in a limited number of centres. When no clinically evident lymph nodes were present (NO) considering the tumour histotype, two thirds of patients underwent surgery or radiotherapy, while in the remainder the wait-and-see attitude was prefered. Post-operative - complementary radiotherapy was very frequently performed instead of chemotherapy. Oncological results obtained were compared with those reported in the literature: in fact for all benign neoplasms relapse ratings are about 5 %, while for malignant tumours the worst prognosis was in squamous cell carcinoma with median of 37. 7 on survival and metastasis rate of 16. 5 %. Finally, mucoepidermoid carcinoma tumours showed best survival, followed by adenoid-cystic carcinoma with ranges, respectively, 83 and 81...|$|E
