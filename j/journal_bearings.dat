5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

By creating texture or micro dimple on a hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> pressure increases and significant improvement has been achieved in its load carrying capacity, lubricant flow rate, coefficient of friction etc. In a present work numerical analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of using negative spherical surface texture on hydrodynamic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> surface and it is compared with normal <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> i. e. <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> without texture. We can take any other profile also but spherical profile is easy to fabricate by laser technology or etching process.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper aims to study the performance of a two-lobe hole-entry hybrid <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> system compensated by orifice restrictors. The Reynolds equation governing the flow of lubricant in the clearance space between the <b>journal</b> and <b>bearing</b> together with the equation of flow through an orifice restrictor has been solved using FEM and Galerkin's method. The bearing performance characteristics results have been simulated for an orifice compensated nonrecessed two-lobe hole-entry hybrid <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> symmetric configuration for the various values of offset factor (), restrictor design parameter (2), and the value of external load (0). Further, a comparative study of the performance of a two-lobe hole-entry hybrid <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> system with a circular hole-entry symmetric hybrid <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> system has also been carried out so that a designer has a better flexibility in choosing a suitable bearing configuration.

40|$|A wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> concept {{features}} a waved inner bearing {{diameter of the}} non-rotating bearing side {{and it is an}} alternative to the plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing.</b> The wave <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> has a significantly increased load capacity in comparison to the plain <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> operating at the same eccentricity. It also offers greater stability than the plain circular bearing under all operating conditions. The wave bearing's design is relatively simple and allows the shaft to rotate in either direction. Three wave bearings are sensitive to the direction of an applied stationary side load. Increasing the number of waves reduces the wave bearing's sensitivity to the direction of the applied load relative to the wave. However, the range in which the bearing performance can be varied decreases as the number of waves increases. Therefore, both the number and the amplitude of the waves must be properly selected to optimize the wave bearing design for a specific application. It is concluded that the stiffness of an air <b>journal</b> <b>bearing,</b> due to hydrodynamic effect, could be doubled and made to run stably by using a six or eight wave geometry with a wave amplitude approximately half of the bearing radial clearance...|$|R

50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} were a breakthrough {{at the end}} of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times.

Without adequate lubrication, <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction.
