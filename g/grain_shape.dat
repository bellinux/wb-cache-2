The base alloy was of approximate composition Ni- 11 % Cr- 5 %Mo- 5 %Al- 4 %Ti with boron levels of 0. 06, 0. 12, and 0. 60 percent (all by weight). Thirty micron thick ribbons display an equiaxed chill zone near the wheel contact side which develops into primary dendrite arms in the ribbon center. Secondary dendrite arms are observed near the ribbon free surface. In the higher boron bearing alloys, boride precipitates are observed along grain boundaries.

In the low boron alloy, <b>grain</b> <b>shapes</b> are often convex, and grain faces are flat.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} kinematic simulations in grinding. Up to now the simulations are carried out under the assumption of an ideal cutting process. Therefore, the simulation results are not exactly identical to the experimental results. For this reason, the simulation needs to be enhanced with the plastic material flow during cutting. To explain this behavior, single grain scratch experiments were conducted to detect the different sources of influence on the plastic deformation and on the pile-up. First, in the experiments the <b>grain</b> <b>shapes</b> {{as well as the}} cutting speeds were varied. To take the effect of different <b>grain</b> <b>shapes</b> into account, three different grains were used. The effect of the cutting speed was investigated at cutting speeds ranging from 60 to 120 m/s. The results were evaluated with a confocal microscope.

50|$|Continuous or penetrative {{cleavage}} describes {{fine grained}} rocks consisting of platy minerals evenly distributed in a preferred orientation.

40|$|Different {{modelling}} {{approaches are}} {{tested for the}} prediction of plastic heterogeneity of a dual-phase polycrystalline microstructure. A novel technique is proposed for the generation of finite element (FE) meshes offering a more realistic representation of the grain topology in 3 D. The model microstructure consists of a primary phase with regular <b>grain</b> <b>shapes,</b> and a secondary phase, characterised by a smaller average grain size, located preferentially at the triple junctions. In order to reduce computational cost, the FE mesh is coarse within the grains and fine at the interfaces. A specifically designed coarsening procedure is used {{to ensure that the}} mesh remains periodic in 3 D. Initial grain orientations are generated such that they constitute a statistically representative sampling of the global texture while accounting for the non-uniform grain size. Compared to other modelling strategies including the conventional Taylor model and FE modelling with <b>grains</b> <b>shaped</b> as bricks or as truncated octahedrons, the new method yields a more accurate prediction of the strain partitioning between the two phases and the macroscopic texture development in a multiphase steel.

These rocks are cap rocks {{of oil and gas}} reservoirs, as well as seals for carbon sequestration. Elasticity of shales has been approached by direct velocity measurements and by models based on microstructures.

It is shown that by application of a self-consistent algorithm based on Eshelby's (1957) model of inclusions in a homogeneous medium, it is possible to explain most experimental elastic constants, though some discrepancies remain which {{may be due to the}} interpretation of experimental data. Using a differential effective medium approach, an almost perfect agreement with experimental stiffness coefficients can be obtained, though the physical basis of this method may be questionable.
