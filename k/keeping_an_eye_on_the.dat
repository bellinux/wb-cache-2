5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Dinah {{can be traced}} back to a poorly {{organized}} area of disturbed weather that formed on August18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00UTC on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low. Late on August20, there was a rapid increase in the coverage of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on August21.|$|E

Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant, but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area.

To their surprise, the Grodno Sejm, bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, enacted the Second Partition of Poland.

500|$|The Charge {{itself and}} the tragedy that {{resulted}} was blamed on both Lucan and Nolan by William Howard Russell–Nolan, for misunderstanding the order and issuing a confusing message, and Lucan, for not properly <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terrain. Raglan himself primarily blamed Lucan, who was infuriated by this and {{wrote a letter to}} Horse Guards Parade disputing Raglan's claim. This was too much for Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, who had Lucan resign his command and return to Britain. With Hardinge unwilling to give him a court martial, Lucan wrote a pamphlet titled A Vindication of the Earl of Lucan from Lord Raglan's Reflections and a series of letters to The Times that revealed Raglan's order to have been highly ambiguous and [...] "not the kind of dispatch required by an officer on the battlefield". At the same time, Nolan's method of delivery had been imperious, and he had insisted the urgency of the attack – something clear in Raglan's verbal order to him, but not in the written order. Public opinion became divided; people both attacked Nolan and rallied to his defence. The major newspapers, at least, maintained that with Nolan's status as a mere messenger it was inconceivable that he alone could have destroyed the Light Brigade without failings by Lucan. Lord Cardigan defended Nolan by saying the Captain [...] "did not have the least idea of the mistake which was about to be perpetrated." [...] Within the Crimea, however, the majority [...] "roundly damned" [...] Nolan. The Charge was soon overshadowed by other scandalous and bloody military failures such as the continued failure of the Siege of Sevastopol.|$|E
