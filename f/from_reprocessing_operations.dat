40|$|Since the {{decision}} was taken to vitrify high-level-liquid waste <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing</b> <b>operations</b> worldwide, the further behaviour of produced glass blocks became interesting especially during cooling. Crack formation and its influence of surface increase, heat removal, equilibrium temperature distribution were investigated with inactive simulates and finally with two high-level glass canisters. In both cases the acoustic emission analysis was used simultaneously with temperature profile recording to evaluat e different cooling modes on the above mentioned characteristics. As result one can state, that crack free active blocks cannot be produced due to remaining thermal gradients. However heat removal is not hampered by the cracks formed. The equilibrium temerature profils can be calculated after fitting the computer codes with results of this report and surface increase estimates are evaluated according to different cooling procedures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} work to bring forward the timing for the immobilization of first cycle raffinate <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing</b> fuel <b>from</b> the Dounreay Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR). First cycle raffinate is the liquor which contains > 99 % of the fission products separated from spent fuel during reprocessing. Approximately 203 m 3 of raffinate <b>from</b> the <b>reprocessing</b> of PFR fuel is held in four tanks at the UKAEA's site at Dounreay, Scotland. Two methods of immobilization of this high level waste (HLW) have been considered: vitrification and cementation. Vitrification is the standard industry practice for the immobilization of first cycle raffinate, and many papers have been presented on this technique elsewhere. However, cementation is potentially feasible for immobilizing first cycle raffinate because the heat output is {{an order of magnitude}} lower than typical HLW <b>from</b> commercial <b>reprocessing</b> <b>operations</b> such as that at the Sellafield site in Cumbria, England. In fact, it falls within {{the upper end of the}} UK definition of intermediate level waste (ILW). Although the decision on which immobilization technique will be employed has yet to be made, initial development work has been undertaken to identify a suitable cementation formulation using inactive simulant of the raffinate. An approach has been made to the waste disposal company Nirex to consider the disposability of the cemented product material.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} {{recommended}} by a recent National Academy of Sciences study to dispose of excess weapons-grade plutonium is to encapsulate the plutonium in a glass in combination with high-level radioactive wastes (HLW) to generate an intense radiation dose rate field. The objective is to render the plutonium as difficult to access as the plutonium contained in existing US commercial spent light-water reactor (LWR) fuel until it can be disposed of in a permanent geological repository. A radiation dose rate from a sealed canister of 1, 000 rem/h (10 Sv/h) at 1 meter for at least 30 years after fabrication was assumed in this paper to be a radiation dose comparable to spent LWR fuel. This {{can be achieved by}} encapsulating the plutonium in a borosilicate glass with an adequate amount of a single fission product in the HLWS, namely radioactive Cs{sup 137 }. One hundred thousand curies of Cs{sup 137 } will generate a dose rate of 1, 000 rem/h (10 Sv/h) at 1 meter for at least 30 years when imbedded into canisters of the size proposed for the Savannah River Site`s vitrified high-level wastes. The United States has a current inventory of 54 MCi of CS{sup 137 } that has been separated from defense HLWs and is in sealed capsules. This single curie inventory is sufficient to spike 50 metric tons of excess weapons-grade plutonium if plutonium can be loaded at 5. 5 wt% in glass, or 540 canisters. Additional CS{sup 137 } inventories exist in the United States` HLWs <b>from</b> past <b>reprocessing</b> <b>operations,</b> should additional curies be required. Using only one fission product, CS{sup 137 }, rather than the multiple chemical elements and compounds in HLWs to generate a high radiation dose rate from a glass canister greatly simplifies the processing engineering retirement for encapsulating plutonium in a borosilicate glass...|$|R

It is estimated that the WVDP`s LLW storage facilities will be filled to capacity in 1996. In order to provide sufficient safe storage of LLW until disposal options become available and partially fulfill requirements under the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA), the DOE is proposing to use U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission-licensed and permitted commercial facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Clive, Utah; and Houston, Texas to treat (volume-reduce) a limited amount of Class A LLW and MLLW generated from the WVDP. Alternatives for ultimate disposal of the West Valley LLW are currently being evaluated in an environmental impact statement. This proposed action is for a limited quantity of waste, over a limited period of time, and for treatment only; this proposal does not include disposal. The proposed action consists of sorting, repacking, and loading waste at the WVDP; transporting the waste for commercial treatment; and returning the residual waste to the WVDP for interim storage. For the purposes of this assessment, environmental impacts were quantified for a five-year operating period (1996 - 2001). Alternatives to the proposed action include no action, construction of additional on-site storage facilities, construction of a treatment facility at the WVDP comparable to commercial treatment, and off-site disposal at a commercial or DOE facility...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT * Spent {{nuclear fuel}} and {{vitrified}} high-level waste (HLW) {{have been selected}} as the main candidates for disposal at the proposed deep geologic repository at Yucca Mountain (YM), Nevada. The question remains: {{what should be done}} about the components, residuals, and side streams <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing</b> of spent nuclear fuel? In general, reprocessing involves dissolving spent nuclear fuel. Subsequent chemical processing can then be used for selective removal of fissile material for reuse and other needed isotopes. The associated waste stream is a solution of fission products and other radioactive elements. By definition, from the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, both the supernate and sludge resulting <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing</b> of spent nuclear fuel are classified as HLW. In other words, wastes <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing</b> are classified by source, and not by risk to human health or the environment. At the Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Savannah River Site, the supernates and sludges <b>from</b> <b>reprocessing,</b> and <b>from</b> production of weapons-grade fissile material, are stored in 51 underground tanks until they can be separated and processed. The supernate is treated to remove fission products, and the remaining low-activity liquid is then made into saltstone and disposed of onsite. The removed fission products are combined with the HLW sludges and vitrified at the Defense Waste Processing Facility for eventual disposal at YM. Thus, the supernate stream, originally classified as HLW, is separated into an HLW fraction, and an incidental or low-level waste (LLW...|$|R

40|$|In May 1988, the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) began pretreating liquid {{high-level}} {{radioactive waste}} (HLW).

Original <b>reprocessing</b> <b>operations</b> used plutonium/uranium extraction (PUREX) and thorium extraction (THOREX) processes to recover usable isotopes from spent nuclear fuel. The PUREX process produced a nitric acid-based waste stream, which was neutralized by adding sodium hydroxide to it. About two million liters of alkaline liquid HLW produced from PUREX neutralization were stored in an underground carbon steel tank identified as Tank 8 D- 2. The THOREX process, which was used to reprocess one core of mixed uranium-thorium fuel, resulted in about 31, 000 liters of acidic waste. This acidic HLW was stored in an underground stainless steel tank identified as Tank 8 D- 4. Pretreatment of the HLW was carried out using the Integrated Radwaste Treatment System (IRTS), from May 1988 until May 1995. This system was designed to decontaminate the liquid HLW, remove salts from it, and encapsulate the resulting waste into a cement waste form that achieved US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) criteria for low-level waste (LLW) storage and disposal.
