25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a <b>fireproof</b> <b>panel</b> and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|E

A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.Because the pilot was above the extension shaft, he was placed higher in the fuselage than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view. Access to the cockpit was via sideways opening [...] "car doors", one on either side. Both had wind-down windows. As only the right-hand door had a handle both inside and outside this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.|$|E

In {{order to}} look into the causes of fire {{response}} and post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubular columns protected with different materials, the fire test was conducted for a set of circular steel tubes protected with different materials such as gypsum <b>fireproof</b> <b>panel,</b> bamboo plywood and the ordinary lumber core plywood, and the steel tube without any protective material. The fire response temperature of surface of steel tubes is measured and the axial compressive bearing capacity of the specimens after fire are tested and analyzed. The test results show that gypsum <b>fireproof</b> <b>panel</b> has the best fire protection characteristics, the ordinary lumber core plywood and bamboo plywood can also retard rising of the surface temperature of the steel tubes during the initial 35 min although they are combustible materials. It is found that the post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubes protected with different materials varies evidently, and the maximum value of response temperature has the greatest effect...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{construction}} {{application of a}} technique to improve the fire resistance of high strength concrete is presented. Before the construction application, fire tests of three hours duration were carried out in accordance with ISO- 834. Three types of mitigating methods, namely, a specimen with no protection (control), with <b>fireproof</b> <b>panel</b> protection and with the combination of polypropylene fibre reinforcement and metal mesh confinement (Fibre/Mesh), were applied to full sized columns for comparison purposes. The fire resistance performance of all columns was tested under loads. After the fire tests, the severity of spalling of specimens was assessed, and the best performing technique, Fibre/Mesh, for spalling protection was selected for an application in practice. The process of the construction application is described in detail, including pumping, pouring and compacting of the concrete. The concrete quality was examined and the behaviour of the concrete was observed. Consequently, it was verified that this new spalling resistance technique is feasible in practice...|$|E

Her sister entered service the following year. The ship was considered remarkable for her time, with her <b>fireproof</b> aluminum <b>panel</b> interiors and, unlike other ships of their service, every single cabin had its own bathroom. In the early 1960s Grace abandoned their South American route and put the Santa Paula and her sister on Caribbean cruising service permanently. On November 25, 1964, while the Santa Paula was returning to New York from the Caribbean, the Israeli passenger ship SS Shalom collided with the tanker MV Stolt Dagali, slicing its stern section off. The Santa Paula was the first ship {{to respond to the}} SOS sent out by the tanker's crew, and managed to rescue 25 of the 43 on board. After being operated successfully for 11 years, Grace Line sold their shipping interests to the Prudential Lines, becoming Prudential-Grace Lines. Despite high passenger numbers, in January 1971 she was put out of service and laid up at Hampton Roads, Virginia.|$|R
