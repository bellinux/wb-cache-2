5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a <b>guardroom</b> or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a <b>guardroom</b> controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a <b>guardroom.</b> On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 the Poles began {{construction}} of fortifications {{in the city}} of Ruda Śląska, creating points of defence Godula, Nowy Bytom and Radoszowy. Barracks were built as well as munitions depots and <b>guardrooms.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{complex is}} located inside Osówka Mountain (German: Säuferhöhen) [...] It is {{accessible}} by tunnel number1 (120m) with chambers for <b>guardrooms</b> and tunnel number2 (456m), bored 10m {{below the level}} of the main underground, with <b>guardrooms</b> close to completion. Behind them there is a connection of two levels created by the collapse of the ceiling. The structure is a grid of tunnels (1,750m, 6,700m2, 30,000m3) and underground halls, up to 8m in height. Only 6.9% is reinforced by concrete. There is a shaft leading to the surface with a diameter of 6m (48m). Tunnel number3 (107m) is not connected to the complex. It is 500m away and 45m below the main underground. It contains two dams and hydraulic equipment of an unknown purpose.|$|R
25|$|The {{soldier was}} able to fight off the three men and his shouts alerted the British {{soldiers}} in the <b>guardroom</b> near the main entrance. It was through the main gate that the raiders had planned to use to flee if things went wrong. With their escape route blocked, the soldiers now shooting from the <b>guardroom,</b> Boyce and his men retreated back the way they came over the wall and escaped into the surrounding marshes. The 20 other raiders outside the main entrance were left standing outside the main gate.|$|E
25|$|It {{stretches}} credibility somewhat, {{according to}} Sean O'Mahony, that the garrison of Dublin Castle {{found it impossible}} to prevent the escape of three unarmed prisoners from the <b>guardroom</b> without shooting them.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{is still}} entered via the 15th century gatehouse. This is semi-ruinous above ground level, but a <b>guardroom</b> and prison {{can be seen}} within. The gate opens onto a courtyard, {{containing}} a well, around which the buildings are arranged.|$|E

50|$|The fort {{was built}} as a 70 by 70 meters square (233 by 233 ft) on October 18, 1874. The east side held the men's {{quarters}} and the west side held those of the Mounties. Buildings such as hospitals, stores, and <b>guardrooms</b> were in the south end. Stables and the blacksmith's shop were in the north end.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1802-11, prisoners, mostly convicts from St Mary's Island, {{were set}} to work on {{extending}} the tunnels and creating vast underground stores and shelters, new magazines, barracks, gun batteries and <b>guardrooms.</b> More than 50 smooth-bore cannon were also mounted. The last building works were completed in about 1820. A maze of tunnels, used to move ammunition around the fort, were dug into the chalk cliffs.|$|R
25|$|Upon their arrest, {{the three}} men {{were taken to the}} old detective office in the Exchange Court. According to T. Ryle Dwyer, the room was being used as a kind of <b>guardroom,</b> and was {{furnished}} with some beds, tables and some stores, which included a box of hand grenades.|$|E
25|$|The cloister and {{residential}} buildings {{stretched to the}} north of the church. Large, two-storey buildings surrounded the cloister, including the kitchens and stores. In addition to the main complex, there was a gatehouse with <b>guardroom,</b> a large barn 72 × 24 and a hayhouse, a kilnhouse, a stable, and a thatched watermill.|$|E
25|$|Above ground are {{foundations}} of buildings and machinery, two reservoirs of water, a pumping station, and {{remains of a}} sewage treatment plant. In 1975–1976 four bunkers Ringstand58c, and a <b>guardroom</b> were demolished. The narrow gauge railway connecting the tunnels with the railway siding {{in the village of}} Lubiechów (German: Liebichau) was dismantled after the war.|$|E
50|$|Quarengi {{organized}} the internal {{space of the}} two buildings according to their functional purpose. The utilitarian Mint was laid out as a corridor between two perimeter rows of storerooms, each ending with guardhouses or <b>guardrooms.</b> The main building has enfilade arrangement and grand main staircase. The side walls are plastically designed with pairs of Corinthian pilasters and statues in niches. A more rigorous and monumental lobby is decorated in Doric order.|$|R
5000|$|The narrow ancient {{streets of}} the picturesquely sited and massed medieval centre are still preserved, {{as well as the}} castello, once a {{possession}} of the Benedictine Order; it dates from the 11th century. The castle is built {{at the end of a}} spur, overlooking Arsoli on one side and extending formal gardens on the other. four frescoed rooms on the piano nobile are flanked by <b>guardrooms</b> hung with arms and armor and family portraits.|$|R
500|$|The {{principal}} tower, or gatehouse, is rectangular in plan [...] by , {{and almost}} [...] high, with a projecting round tower on the north-east corner, beside the entrance. It comprises the Lord's Hall, and three storeys of chambers above, located over the entrance passage. The vaulted, cobbled passage, [...] long, was formerly defended by {{two sets of}} timber doors, and a yett, or hinged iron grille, remains. <b>Guardrooms</b> on either side overlook the passage via gunloops, and also {{on the ground floor}} is a well, {{in the basement of the}} round tower.|$|R
25|$|Overton {{could not}} find Cadet Eaton, who was {{checking}} the South Barracks, but did find Major Worth. Hitchcock met Worth and told him what had transpired. By this time, Thayer's aide {{had arrived in the}} North Barracks' <b>guardroom.</b> The Second Artillery had arrived at the North Barracks by the time of reveille at 06:05.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} was launched from a farmhouse in Dundalk {{about a mile}} south of the border. The initial plan {{was to have a}} lorry transport the majority of the 19-man raiding party. The majority were armed with Thompson submachine guns as well as small arms, grenades and burglary tools. When the lorry failed to arrive, however, they were forced to improvise and called a local haulier on the pretense of moving a herd of cattle. The haulier, once he arrived, was forced into a tent and his vehicle stolen. The raiders left in two groups with the smaller of the two travelling in a car. They were specifically tasked with taking over the <b>guardroom.</b> That afternoon, at around 3:00pm, the car drove through the barracks' gate. As the men held up the <b>guardroom,</b> one of the raiders took the place of the sentry. This man, having spent some time in the Irish equivalent on the British Territorial Army, was able to convincingly march up and down the gate.|$|E
25|$|Many town walls, monastic precincts and palaces had gatehouses {{built with}} a <b>guardroom</b> or living {{quarters}} above a large archway. One {{of the earliest}} is the gateway of Lorsch Abbey, {{the lower part of}} which has three openings like a Roman triumphal arch, while the upper part, of polychrome brick, has detailing resembling half-timbered house, the effect enhanced by the large steeply pitched slate roof. By contrast the gatehouse of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds resembles a church tower. Many Romanesque gates are set into the walls of Italian cities. These are invariably of fine masonry and battlemented but otherwise without ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|The fort {{is small}} but strong and well-designed. It is {{surrounded}} by trench from all the sides.Fort comprise a rectangular plan with strong defences provided by a double curtain wall and a deep ditch surrounding the outer wall.The walls are topped with battlemented parapets along with regularly spaced box shaped <b>guardrooms.</b> The gates are defended by traversals and redoubts and the Ramparts. These are of the out and dressed stones with round bastions fitted for the heavy guns of the period. Around the fort there is a moat, which was always kept filled with water.|$|R
500|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the south-east {{corner is}} [...] square, and its vaulted passageway was originally {{protected by a}} portcullis, gate and a drawbridge. On {{either side of the}} passageway were two vaulted <b>guardrooms,</b> [...] long and up to [...] wide. On the first floor, since lost, there was a large chamber, [...] wide, with an ancillary room, [...] square, and a doorway that led onto some form of forebuilding or platform. The gatehouse has what architectural historian Anthony Emery has described as [...] "flamboyant window tracing", and the Manners' coat of arms are carved above the entrance to the gatehouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} tower, or gatehouse, is rectangular in plan 18 m by 13 m, {{and almost}} 29 m high, with a projecting round tower on the north-east corner, beside the entrance. It comprises the Lord's Hall, and three storeys of chambers above, located over the entrance passage. The vaulted, cobbled passage, 14 m long, was formerly defended by {{two sets of}} timber doors, and a yett, or hinged iron grille, remains. <b>Guardrooms</b> on either side overlook the passage via gunloops, and also {{on the ground floor}} is a well, {{in the basement of the}} round tower.|$|R
25|$|A {{contingent}} under Seán Connolly occupied Dublin City Hall {{and adjacent}} buildings. They attempted to seize neighbouring Dublin Castle, {{the heart of}} British rule in Ireland. As they approached the gate a lone police sentry, James O'Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, {{he was the first}} casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the <b>guardroom,</b> but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Sir Matthew Nathan, helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease. The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall. Fierce fighting erupted there after British reinforcements arrived. The rebels on the roof exchanged fire with soldiers on the street. Seán Connolly was shot dead by a sniper, becoming the first rebel casualty. By the following morning, British forces had re-captured City Hall and taken the rebels prisoner.|$|E
500|$|Behind {{the battery}} {{is a large}} room, [...] by , forming a hall and kitchen, {{originally}} {{for the use of}} the garrison and containing a fireplace and oven. The room has two bedrooms leading off it, each [...] square. The north bedroom may have been heated by a small brazier. A <b>guardroom,</b> [...] square, forms the entrance to the building, leading into the hall.|$|E
500|$|Moving {{counter-clockwise}} {{around the}} curtain wall from the north-west, the rectangular Lilburn Tower looks out across Embleton beach. The tower {{was named after}} an early castle constable, John de Lilburn, but may have been built under Thomas of Lancaster; it {{was intended as a}} high-status residence, 59-foot (18 m) high, [...] square with [...] thick walls, with a <b>guardroom</b> for soldiers on the ground floor. The rectangular towers at Dunstanburgh reflects the local tradition in Northumberland, and are similar to those at nearby Alnwick. Further along the wall there are the remains of a small tower, called Huggam's House by local tradition. Earthworks around the inside of the curtain wall suggest that there may once have been a complex of buildings stretching between Lilburn Tower and Huggam's House.|$|E
50|$|The stone keep was {{circular}} {{with four}} towers each four storeys high; {{two of them}} close together formed a gatehouse, and the east tower contained a well, 37 m deep. The double-walled keep would have had <b>guardrooms,</b> storerooms and servants' quarters on the ground floor, the main hall above and private apartments on the second floor. The tower rooms had garderobes, (lavatories) that discharged on the outer walls of the keep. The curtain wall was 6 m feet high with a wall walk along its length, it enclosed the bailey and crossed the moat twice to reach the keep.|$|R
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the <b>guardrooms,</b> sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the south-east {{corner is}} 36 ft square, and its vaulted passageway was originally {{protected by a}} portcullis, gate and a drawbridge. On {{either side of the}} passageway were two vaulted <b>guardrooms,</b> 21 ft long and up to 6 ft wide. On the first floor, since lost, there was a large chamber, 22 by 19 ft wide, with an ancillary room, 7 ft square, and a doorway that led onto some form of forebuilding or platform. The gatehouse has what architectural historian Anthony Emery has described as [...] "flamboyant window tracing", and the Manners' coat of arms are carved above the entrance to the gatehouse.|$|R
500|$|Goodall {{suggests}} that the keep was used only for short periods, and the west range, including the great hall, was the lord's preferred residence for prolonged visits to Warkworth Castle. The ground floor was used predominantly for storage of food and wine, {{but there was also}} a room with access to a basement chamber roughly [...] square. This has variously been interpreted as an accounting room with a floor safe, or <b>guardroom</b> with a dungeon dug into the floor. In the keep's west wall was a postern through which stores would pass into the building. Kitchens occupied the west side of the first floor and were connected via staircases to the stores immediately below. In the south-east corner was a great hall, originally heated by a central hearth and spanning the height of the first and second floors. A chapel off the great hall led to a large formal room where the lord would meet guests. The second floor was entirely domestic in nature, with bedrooms and withdrawing chambers. In the 19thcentury, while the rest of Warkworth Castle was in ruins, the rooms of the second floor were re-roofed and occasionally used by the duke on visits. At the centre of the keep was a lightwell with interior windows; at its foot was a tank for collecting rainwater used for cleaning.|$|E
500|$|Brougham Castle is {{entered through}} a three-storey double-gatehouse. Originally the {{coat of arms}} of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the {{entrance}} to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription, [...] "Thys Made Roger", by Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet. The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford. Erected on the slope inclining down to the river, the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. The complex has three components: the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between. The inner gatehouse survives to a height of [...] in the east. The ground-floor passage through the building is vaulted and there was a portcullis at the east end. A postern gate was hidden behind a buttress in {{the north side of the}} gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle. The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep, allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside. In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom. Like the inner gatehouse, the outer section had a square plan, and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room. The building survives to a height of [...] in the east. Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon, and at ground floor level on the north side the <b>guardroom.</b> The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences. Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives, it would have been crested by machicolations.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sean O'Mahony, {{they were}} {{tortured}} in the <b>guardroom</b> {{in order to}} extort from them {{the names of the}} Volunteers who had earlier that morning shot the fourteen members of the Cairo Gang. Refusing to talk, they were [...] "subsequently murdered" [...] on the evening of 21 November 1920.|$|E
500|$|The {{passageway}} {{through the}} gatehouse {{was protected by}} a portcullis and possibly a set of wooden gates. The ground floor contained two <b>guardrooms,</b> each [...] wide, and latrines, with spiral staircases {{in the corner of}} the gatehouse running up to the first floor, where relatively well-lit chambers with fireplaces probably accommodated the garrison's officers. The staircases continued up to the second floor, containing the castle's great hall, an antechamber and bedchamber, originally intended for the use of Thomas of Lancaster and his family. Four towers extended above the gatehouse's lead-covered roof for an additional two storeys of height, giving extensive views of the surrounding area. This design may have influenced the construction of Henry IV's gatehouse at Lancaster Castle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first floor}} formed an arched entrance/exit to the city. The second floor was <b>guardrooms.</b> Originally these were for barracks for Sukharev's {{regiment}} of streltsy but the streltsy were disbanded {{at the end}} of the 17th century. The third floor housed the Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation. The school was part of Peter's grand plan to introduce western education to Russia. Some remodeling was done in 1701 by Choglokov. Count Yakov Bruce made the upper story his astronomical observatory, the first in Russia. The fourth floor had a clock and a state coat of arms. [...] "An attractive typically Muscovite, wide exterior staircase led to a gallery on the first floor and surrounded the building." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{complex is}} located inside Włodarz Mountain (German: Wolfsberg) [...] It is {{a grid of}} tunnels (3,100m, 10,700m2, 42,000m3) and large {{underground}} halls, up to 12m in height. Less than one per cent is reinforced by concrete. It was accessible by four tunnels bored into {{the base of the}} mountain with chambers for <b>guardrooms.</b> There is a shaft leading to the surface with diameter 4m (40m). Some tunnels have higher, second levels connected by small shafts. This is a stage of building underground halls. Two tunnels were bored, one over the other and then the ceiling was collapsed to create large space. Some parts of the complex are flooded but accessible by boat. From 2004 it is open to visitors.|$|R
