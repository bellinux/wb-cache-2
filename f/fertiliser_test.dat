40|$|<b>Fertiliser</b> <b>test</b> strips are a {{tool that}} can assist in {{determining}} the responsiveness of a pasture to applied nutrients. They are useful in certain situations or {{in combination with other}} tools. Introduction A pasture 2 ̆ 7 s nutrient requirements should be assessed using a number of methods, including soil and plant tissue testing and visual paddock indicators. Soil tests are a good tool for assessing the fertility levels of the major nutrients (Phosphorus, Potassium, and Sulphur) as well as soil characteristics, properties and structure. Tissue tests are the preferred method for testing the trace element status of the soil. Soil test strips are another tool that can provide a guide to the responsiveness of a pasture to nutrients, but they are not always effective. <b>Fertiliser</b> <b>test</b> strips are basically a trial conducted in the paddock {{to see if there is}} any response to added nutrients or a combination of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Since 1995 the Finnish Agri-Environmental Program has {{set limits}} for {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser application rates in agriculture. The decrease in N and P fertiliser recommendations, {{and especially the}} decrase in N and P amounts applied in practice, has {{raised the question of}} whether N and P application rates are too low to produce high quality yields. The test weight, 1000 grain weight and protein concentrations measured in 19902005 by the Cereal Inspection Unit of the Finnish Food Safety Authority were analysed against soil type, location and NP fertiliser data. The {{purpose of this study was}} to document and statistically analyse changes in fertiliser use, important quality factors and the connection between fertiliser use and grain quality of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.) as well as spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Applications of N and P <b>fertiliser,</b> <b>test</b> weight and 1000 grain weight have decreased in Finland since 1990 - 1994. Protein content began to decrease in 19951999, but then increased in 20002005. The statistical analysis showed that reduced N application rates are associated with lower test weight, 1000 grain weight and grain protein concentration. In addition, low P application rates were associated with reduced 1000 grain weight and protein concentration in some instances, although protein concentration also increased in winter wheat grain. The magnitude of grain quality reduction was not solely explicable through N and P application rates. During the observation period many other factors changed in Finnish cereal production and, for example, the decrease in cereal prices, increase of reduced tillage and low investments in drainage and liming could have been associated with decreased grain quality. ...|$|E
40|$|Trials {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Rice Production during 2003 - 2004 investigated alternative weed management, cultivar {{assessments and}} fertiliser strategies in order to improve the sustainability of organic rice production systems in the NSW Riverina. Results indicated there was no immediate rice yield benefit to organic producers by applying any of the various organic <b>fertilisers</b> <b>tested.</b> Ongoing experimentation may have shown benefits to cereal or pastures which followed in the rotation, but this was not evaluated. The authors recommend that organic rice farmers carefully monitor crop yield responses to fertiliser applications and carefully consider the cost:benefit of fertiliser applications to their cropping and livestock rotation. Whilst the yields achieved for organic rice during the experiments were low compared to district averages for ‘conventionally’ grown rice during the 2003 - 04 season (yields ranged from 71 - 86...|$|R
40|$|A mature {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) forest {{located on the}} eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, USA, was treated with three {{different}} nitrogen fertilisers to compare their relative ability to increase extractable soil-nitrogen, pine foliar-nitrogen, and basal area. <b>Fertilisers</b> <b>tested</b> were urea, ammonium nitrate, and biosolids (a domestic sewage sludge). Urea and ammonium nitrate were applied {{at a rate of}} 220 kg N/ha, and biosolids at 11 Mg/ha (which was assumed to provide 240 kg available-N/ha in the first year). All fertilisers increased extractable soil-nitrogen in the first year after application but not always significantly; levels dropped to those of the control soil by year 2. Foliar concentration of nitrogen was increased by all fertilisers; however, urea did not increase foliar concentrations until the second year after application. Biosolids continued to increase foliar nitrogen through year 5, and caused the highest levels of foliar nitrogen. Basal area was not increased by any fertiliser over the 5 -year period. Soil solutions showed increases in ammonium (NH 4 +) and nitrate (N 03 ~) in the upper profile, but increases in solution nitrogen {{at the base of the}} soil profile were found only with the urea treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were to investigate (i) {{the forms and}} release pattern of P from an ash-rich biochar-amended sandy soil; (ii) the transformation of biochar P in a soil-plant system. Several methodologies (a bioassay test, soluble P extractions, a sequential P fractionation and successive P extractions via resin strips) were used to study the bioavailability and transformation of P in a sandy soil fertilised with either conventional P fertilisers [Ca(H 2 PO 4) (2) (CaP) and Sechura phosphate rock (SPR) ] or biochars produced from cattle manure (MAe) and alum-treated biosolids (BSe) at four temperatures (250, 350, 450, and 550 A degrees C). Biochar P mainly contributed to increase soil resin-extractable P- and inorganic NaOH-extractable P-fractions, and thus to plant available P. The decrease in P concentrations of those fractions {{was caused by the}} uptake of P by plants rather than their transformations into more stable forms. P release rates diminished following the order: CaP > MAe > BSe > SPR, which indicates a decline in P availability from these P sources. Phosphorus-rich biochar {{can be used as a}} slow-release fertiliser. It is necessary to determine available P (either soil or <b>fertiliser</b> <b>tests)</b> in biochars prior to its application to soil, so that dose, frequency and timing of application are correctly established...|$|R

Radishes (Raphanus sativus L.) and white cabbage (Brassica d-eracea var. capitata L.) were chosen as fest crops. Beside the unamended control four ({R}adish trial) and two ({C}abbage trial) fertilisers were investigated: Castor pomace (Ricinus communis L), pellets of crushed seeds of lupin (Lupinus luteus L), and faba bean (Vicia faba var. minor L.) and Phytoperls® (Zea mays L). They were applied in two N-levels {(R) : 80 and 140 kg N ha- 1; (C) : 120 and 240 kg N ha 1 {{with the two}} first mentioned fertilisers}. Castor pomace and lupin seed pellets {{were found to be}} more efficient N supplies than faba bean seed pellets and Phytoperls®; on the Iow level > 30 % vs. 40 % for cabbage. In both cases lupin seed pellets were slightly more efficient than castor pomace. On the other hand lupin seed pellets caused distinctly Iower nitrate contents than castor pomace, in both species...|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean climate {{ecosystems}} (MCEs) are {{amongst the}} most heavily degraded ecosystems worldwide. Restoration efforts are challenged by high vulnerability to extreme drought, which is projected to become more frequent with future climate change. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} whether restoration efforts could be enhanced through the individual and combined effects of the site preparation technique of soil ripping and the addition of <b>fertilisers.</b> We <b>tested</b> the effects of ripping and fertiliser (±surfactant) on survival, shoot height, crown health, root biomass and leaf physiology of Eucalyptus gomphocephala seedlings in degraded MCEs in Western Australia. Restoration treatments had a much stronger impact under closed canopy (forest) compared to open canopy (woodland) conditions. In the forest, soil ripping doubled seedling survival and together with fertiliser application enhanced shoot height 2. 35 -fold relative to control seedlings. Ripping resulted in more favourable leaf water potentials and enhanced stomatal conductance suggesting increased water availability compared to unripped soil. In the woodland, fertilisation improved seedling survival and stimulated shoot height (+ 45 %) and root biomass (> 2 -fold). Our results demonstrate that restoration techniques targeting the co-limitation by water and nutrients can greatly increase chances of successful restoration in these types of ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{that come}} early in {{succession}} predominantly prefer_ ammonium form of nitrogen than nitrate. The hypothesis that Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., a {{grass in the}} primary succession stage would respond well when supplied with ammonium than nitrate <b>fertiliser</b> was <b>tested.</b> Seedlings of Cynodon dactylon were grown in culture solution and fertilised with either ammonium sulphate or potassium nitrate at ~ continuous concentrations of 200 ppm, 400 ppm and 600 ppm in the growth chamber. In support of my hypothesis, growth of Cynodon dactylon was greater from ammonium than nitrate nutrition in terms of aboveground and total plants yields at 200 ppm and 400 ppm and this was associated with efficient utilisation of this form of nitrogen by this species. Production from the nitrate treatments was restricted and showed no change with increase in external nitrogen supply. Decreased dry weights from the ammonium nutrition at 600 ppm were associated with toxicity of ammonium ions in plant tissues. High levels of nitrogen measured from the nitrate treatments {{were associated with the}} soluble nitrogen that was not assimilated for yield increase by this grass, Uptake of ammonium ion was shown to result· in high of uptake phosphorus. This study shows that Cynodon dactylon has the capacity for increased growth under ammonium nutrition while this was limited in the nitrate nutrition.

30|$|In the UCPH experiment, {{plants were}} {{harvested}} after 32 (Fig.  1 b) and 54  days (Fig.  1 c). The normalised biomass across all treatments was significantly different between harvests (paired t test, P <  0.001); therefore, the normalised aboveground biomass {{data from the}} two harvests were analysed individually. The normalised biomass was significantly different between P-fertilisation treatments at both harvests (two-way ANOVA, P <  0.001). In contrast to this, the different BE inoculations {{did not affect the}} biomass obtained (two-way ANOVA, P >  0.05) and no interaction was observed between the two factors (two-way ANOVA, P >  0.05). At both harvests, all treatments in which a P fertiliser was applied resulted in a significantly higher aboveground biomass than the control without added P <b>fertiliser</b> (Dunnett’s <b>test,</b> P <  0.05). The absence of a significantly higher aboveground biomass when inoculating with the three BEs (TrP, Pro, RhVi) compared to the uninoculated control (BE 0) was confirmed for sewage sludge, sewage sludge ash and compost as the P fertilisers in a follow-up experiment at the University of Copenhagen in which only five wheat plants were grown in each pot (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 1). P uptake was only evaluated for the P fertilisers SSA and FFPM at the second harvest (Table  6 b). No effect was produced by either of the two main factors (P fertiliser and BE addition) and there was no interaction between the two factors in relation to the aboveground P content (two-way ANOVA, P >  0.05).|$|R

40|$|Arsenic (As) {{concentrations}} in soil, soil pore water and plant tissues were evaluated {{in a pot}} experiment following the transplantation of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plantlets to a heavily As contaminated mine soil (~ 6000 mg kg− 1 pseudo-total As) receiving an orchard prune residue biochar amendment, with and without NPK <b>fertiliser.</b> An in-vitro <b>test</b> was also performed to establish if tomato seeds were able to germinate in various proportions of biochar added to nutrient solution (MS). Biochar significantly increased arsenic {{concentrations in}} pore water (500 μg L− 1 – 2000 μg L− 1) whilst root and shoot concentrations were significantly reduced compared to the control without biochar. Fruit As concentrations were very low (< 3 μg kg− 1), indicating minimal toxicity and transfer risk. Fertilisation was required to significantly increase plant biomass above the control after biochar addition whilst plants transplanted to biochar only were heavily stunted and chlorotic. Given that {{increasing the amount of}} biochar added to nutrient solution in-vitro reduced seed germination by up to 40 %, a lack of balanced nutrient provision from biochar could be concluded. In summary, solubility and mobility of As were increased by biochar addition to this soil, but uptake to plant was reduced, and toxicity-transfer risk was negligible. Therefore leaching rather than food chain transfer appears the most probable immediate consequence of biochar addition to As contaminated soils...|$|R
40|$|A {{problem with}} augmenting predatory bugs through mass release is the {{logistical}} difficulty of delivering nymphs onto the foliage of field crops. In this paper we examine postrelease establishment and dispersal of the nymphs of the predatory bug Pristhesancus plagipennis on soybean, cotton and sunflower {{in an effort}} to devise an appropriate strategy for field release. The effects of predator stadia and release rates on field establishment and within-crop-canopy dispersal after hand release were recorded in soybean, cotton and sunflower. Field establishment improved with the release of more-developed nymphs, with third instars providing the most appropriate compromise between field hardiness and rearing cost. Increased nymphal density at the point of release had little effect on nymphal dispersal throughout the crop canopy. The patterns of nymphal dispersal observed on the three crops suggest that crop-canopy architecture may {{have an effect on the}} ability of nymphs to spread out postrelease, as nymphs dispersed poorly in cotton and sunflower compared to soybean. To overcome poor dispersal of nymphs after release, a mechanical release method, where nymphs were mixed with vermiculite and delivered onto a target crop through a spinning disk <b>fertiliser</b> spreader, was <b>tested,</b> and provided similar nymph establishment rates and dispersal patterns as releasing nymphs individually by hand. The implications of nymph dispersal and field hardiness in regard to inundative field release techniques are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In Vietnam acacia {{plantations}} are {{an important}} resource {{for the production of}} pulpwood and sawn timber. However, research is needed to support sustainable and profitable production over successive rotations. This thesis reports on results from three field experiments which were conducted on Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia hybrid species in Vietnam. The experiments explored the growth and physiological responses of acacia to slash management, thinning and <b>fertiliser</b> application to <b>test</b> the hypothesis that constraints in nutrients and/or water and light resources were constraining the growth of acacias, both at establishment, and later in the rotation. The rationale for focusing on resource constraints is that they offer some opportunity for management intervention.

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} solid waste generation is an unavoidable occurrence {{due to the}} fast growing urbanisation and industrialisation in Malaysia. Anaerobic digestion of organic wastes is receiving more attention in recent years throughout the world because the biomethanogenesis process decomposes organic matter to produce methane gas, which is an excellent energy source as fuel in {{combined heat and power}} units. In this study, an application of an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) for the production of biogas from kitchen waste was carried out to identify the optimum efficiency of methane gas generation and the potential usage of sludge as organic fertiliser. Different proportions of kitchen waste and activated sewage sludge were mixed and tested in the reactor to achieve the best amount of methane production in the shortest time. Results showed that the combination of 75 % of kitchen waste and 25 % of activated sewage sludge yielded the best result, which was 74. 1 % of methane gas. Further, determination for <b>fertiliser</b> value from <b>tests</b> on the sludge in the reactor showed its potential for future use in composting. The amounts of N, P and K were 0. 95, 0. 80 and 0. 45 % respectively.

40|$|The {{response}} of perennial ryegrass and white clover to soil temperatures of 6, 12 and 18 °C, and to nitrogen applications equivalent to 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha- 1, were investigated under controlled conditions. Ryegrass primary dry matter production (PDM) {{at the end}} of the first regrowth cycle (31 days) increased as fertiliser N rate was increased from 0 to 100 kg N ha- 1. Residual dry matter production (RDM) {{at the end of}} the second regrowth cycle (60 days) and total dry matter production (TDM) over the two regrowth cycles were increased by all N application rates tested. Although yield responses were less at 6 °C compared to 12 and 180 °C, results clearly showed that N applications could be used to stimulate dry matter production of ryegrass during the cool season. White clover PDM, RDM and TDM were significantly influenced (P 0. 05) by soil temperature resulting in lower yields at 6 °C. None of the <b>fertiliser</b> N treatments <b>tested</b> resulted in significant reductions in clover PDM, RDM and TDM. Increasing fertiliser N rates increased (P 0. 05) the number of ryegrass tillers, but stolon growing points of white clover were not affected.
