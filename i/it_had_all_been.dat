25|$|Adams was {{appointed}} as West Indies captain in 2000, replacing Brian Lara. He would not last long, leading {{the team to}} a 5–0 series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia; after the tour he lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and {{his place in the}} national team. News of his impending termination was broken to Adams by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. The ever-cool Jamaican simply responded, ¨Have you heard something I haven't?¨ He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> a blessing – both the good and bad. Adams´ grace {{in the face of what}} would crush many a lesser person reflects the nature of the man; a cricketer whose best attributes can never be recorded on the score sheets.|$|E
500|$|SFX Magazine Jordan Farley {{gave the}} episode 3 {{and a half}} out of 5 stars, saying the {{direction}} [...] "never quite [...] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare" [...] and the camera was [...] "a little flat" [...] with a strange angle. He was displeased with the discovery that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock {{in the way you}} might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a lot of fun to watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E

2500|$|On March 31, 2017, Takei {{announced}} his intent to challenge Devin Nunes, Republican incumbent House Representative for the 22nd District of California.

I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Fo and Rame {{began their}} third theatre group, Collettivo Teatrale [...] "La Comune" [...] with the {{musician}} Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi. They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (capannone) in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting {{it into a}} sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non è servito a niente (I'd Rather Die Tonight If I Had To Think <b>It</b> <b>Had</b> <b>All</b> <b>Been</b> In Vain). Inspired by the Black September, with the title derived from a Renata Viganò poem, thousands of people came to see it.|$|E
2500|$|Hitler, however, {{immediately}} realised that he {{had gone}} too far in arbitrarily sacking the most senior commander of the German Army. He arrived in Poltava on 3 December, where he found both Reichenau and Dietrich firm in defending the correctness of Rundstedt's actions. Sodenstern explained the full circumstances of the retreat from Rostov to Hitler, an explanation which Hitler grudgingly accepted. Hitler then met with Rundstedt and excused himself on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> a misunderstanding. He suggested that Rundstedt take a period of leave, [...] "and then once more place your incomparable services at my disposal." [...] On 5 December, his honour restored, Rundstedt left Poltava, never to return to the Russian front.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, [...] "some 63,000 steel rivets {{have been}} {{replaced}} - about 40% of the total." [...] The Shanghai Morning Post reported that engineers found high sulfur content in the bridge after conducting tests on its structural integrity, necessitating {{the removal of the}} [...] "rust, ... and aging structures strengthened during the repair". Repainting was another major task with all the rust and old paint removed from the bridge before new coats were applied. According to the project engineers, [...] "There was a thick layer of old paint on the bridge, the result of many rounds of repainting during previous repairs. After <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> removed, workers used anti-rust paint of the same silver-grey colour as before. Now, not only does the bridge look like new, but it has even more protection against rusting than before." ...|$|E

25|$|Although {{traces of}} the canal through Derby city centre {{remained}} {{until well into the}} twentieth century (the ice factory on what was the Cockpit island drew its water from the canal), <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> covered by development, mainly the inner ring road and Pride Parkway.

He saw it all so clearly before him. Nobody was to blame really, save he himself--he, who alone knew and understood the adversary with whom he had to deal.|$|E

5000|$|Moriarty's stating [...] "There {{is nothing}} new under the sun. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> done before" [...] comes from one of Arthur Conan Doyle's {{original}} Sherlock Holmes stories, [...] "A Study in Scarlet".
