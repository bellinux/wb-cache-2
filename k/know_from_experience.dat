500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; puerperal (childbed) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|E

A successful test asserts that the claim of no radioactive material present is unlikely given the reading (and therefore ...). The double negative (disproving the null hypothesis) of the method is confusing, but using a counter-example to disprove is standard mathematical practice.

2500|$|After Minister and People's Progressive Party President M. Kayveas raised {{concerns}} about local governments in late 2005, some suggested reviving local government elections. However, in an opinion column, the New Straits Times (owned by the United Malays National Organisation or UMNO, leading party of the Barisan Nasional) quoted a professor from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia as saying that such elections would not be brought back because [...] "policymakers <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> worldwide that the Opposition tends to dominate such councils {{as part of the}} electorate's desire for checks-and-balances." [...] The professor also stated that due to required constitutional changes, {{it would be difficult for}} such amendments to pass muster in Parliament. The column also quoted a government ministry as saying that [...] "holding elections are expensive affairs".|$|E

2500|$|In April 1871 Paul Draneht, {{the general}} manager of the Cairo Opera, {{negotiated}} with Sasse about the possibility of appearing as Amneris in the world premiere of Verdi's new opera Aida which was to be performed in Cairo later that year. He wrote about this to Verdi, who then wrote to Giovanni Battista Lampugnani, the theatrical agent in Milan: [...] "I have no use for her – either as Amneris, who is a mezzo-soprano, or as Aida, for other reasons." [...] Draneht visited Verdi at his home in Sant' Agata in May, where they discussed her further. Draneht, having been unaware of Verdi's opposition, had already signed her to sing Amneris. Verdi was adamantly opposed, not only because the part was too low, but because [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> that it {{is in the interest of}} both the management and the composer to give her operas in which she is the only soprano, or at least an opera which has no other role equal or superior to hers." ...|$|E
2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory, states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible {{in order to minimize}} effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence [...] "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable," [...] by the time the reader gets to the word [...] "examined" [...] he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made {{despite the fact that it}} results in an implausible situation; we <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this [...] "syntax first" [...] theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which [...] "the evidence" [...] is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach [...] "by the lawyer" [...] and must go back and re-parse the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.|$|E

60|$|For to shut a man {{out from}} {{free access to}} God and Christ is to make him {{certainly}} false, dishonest, cowardly, degraded, slavish, and sinful; as modern Popery has made, and always will make, those over whom it really gains power.

60|$|According to {{the general}} theory of relativity, the {{geometrical}} properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by matter.

We <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> that, for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at rest.|$|E
