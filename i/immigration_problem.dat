25|$|The Government of Tibet in Exile {{disputes}} most {{demographic statistics}} {{released by the}} PRC government since they do not include members of the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Tibet, or the floating population of unregistered migrants, and states that China is attempting to assimilate Tibet and further diminishing any chances of Tibetan political independence. CCP member Jampa Phuntsok, chairman of the TAR, {{has said that the}} central government has no policy of migration into Tibet due to its harsh high-altitude conditions, that the 6% Han in the TAR is a very fluid group mainly doing business or working, and that there is no <b>immigration</b> <b>problem.</b> (This report includes both permanent and temporary residences in Tibet, but excludes Tibetans studying or working outside of the TAR). By 2006, 3% of the permanent residences in Tibet were of Han ethnicity, according to National Bureau of Statistics of China. The TAR has the lowest population density among China's province-level administrative regions, mostly due to its mountainous and harsh geographical features. As of 2000, 92.8% of the population were ethnic Tibetans, while Han Chinese comprised 6.1% of the population. In Lhasa, the capital of TAR, Hans made up 17%, far less than what many activists have claimed. Population control policies like the one-child policy apply only to Han Chinese, not to minorities such as Tibetans.|$|E

To promote its release, Fox toured many U.S. cities to do book-signings and interviews with U.S. media. During his tour, however, he faced protests from Mexican immigrants who accused him of actions that forced them to emigrate and find jobs in the United States. He faced the subject several times during interviews, such as one held with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, who questioned him about the massive illegal <b>immigration</b> <b>problem</b> of Mexicans into the United States. Finally, during an interview with Telemundo's Rubén Luengas, the interviewer asked Fox about allegations concerning some properties of Vicente Fox's wife, Marta Sahagún. After Fox explained the situation, he asked the interviewer not to make false accusations and to prove what he was saying. Luengas said, [...] "I'm telling you in your face, I'm not a liar."

40|$|Many {{academics}} {{have been}} interested in the reaction of the Japanese government to <b>immigration</b> <b>problems</b> in the Interwar period, especially her reaction to American Immigration Act of 1924. However, there still are not enough works on how the Japanese government reacted in the multilateral discussions concerning <b>immigration</b> <b>problems,</b> especially the discussion in the League of Nations. This article will argue that the Japanese government took the initiative in the discussion in the League to solve <b>immigration</b> <b>problems</b> under a multilateral framework. Just after 1919, the Japanese government refrained from proposing the abolishment of racial discrimination again in the discussion of the amendment of the Covenant of the League, and in the discussion in the first International Conference of Emigration and Immigration held at Rome in 1924. However, the Japanese government took the initiative in the discussion in the Economic Committee of the League to realize equal treatment of foreigners, which could be helpful to Japanese immigrants. In 1924, when the Geneva Protocol was proposed in the fifth assembly of the League, the Japanese delegates proposed an amendment which enabled the League Council to commit to the disputes regarded as domestic matters, and they finally fulfilled their proposal. After 1924, the Japanese government insisted on discussing the treatment of foreigners and population problem at the International Economic Conference held at Geneva in 1927, and her proposal led to the realization of the International Conference on Treatment of Foreigners in 1929. 論文Article...|$|R
