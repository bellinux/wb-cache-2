5000|$|In NEH, <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> necrosis, and {{neutrophils}} surroundings the eccrine glands, {{are typical}} findings on biopsy. If the chemotherapy {{has recently been}} administered, chemotherapy induced neutropenia may be present, and, as a result, the neutrophils may be absent. But the other characteristic finding, i.e. <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> necrosis, can still be seen. A vacuolar interface dermatitis also is visible in glands and ducts, along with necrosis of the lining cells.|$|E
5000|$|Eccrine glands are {{composed}} of an intraepidermal spiral duct, the [...] "acrosyringium"; a dermal duct, consisting of a straight and coiled portion; and a secretory tubule, coiled deep in the dermis or hypodermis. The <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> opens out through the sweat pore. The coiled portion is formed by two concentric layer of columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells. The epithelial cells are interposed by the myoepithelial cells. Myoepithelial cells support the secretory epithelial cells. The duct of <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> is formed by two layers of cuboidal epithelial cells.|$|E
5000|$|The wheals, hypohidrosis, {{and pain}} seems {{to result from}} the low {{expression}} levels of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) in the <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> epithelial cells.|$|E
50|$|Like sweat <b>glands,</b> <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> allow {{excess water}} {{to leave the}} body. The {{majority}} of <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> are located mainly on the forehead, the bottoms of the feet, and the palms, although the glands are everywhere throughout the body. They help the body to maintain temperature control. <b>Eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> in the skin are unique to mammals.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} sweat glands {{can be found}} in humans: <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> and apocrine <b>glands.</b> The <b>eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> are {{distributed}} over much of the body.|$|R

50|$|In {{people who}} have hyperhidrosis, the sweat glands (eccrine glands in particular) overreact to stimuli and are just {{generally}} overactive, producing more sweat than normal. Similarly, cystic fibrosis patients also produce salty sweat. But in these cases, the problem is in the CFTR chloride transporter that is also located on the apical membrane of <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> ducts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{apocrine gland}} {{is made up}} of a [...] of {{secretory}} tubules and an excretory duct that opens into a hair follicle; on occasion, an excretory duct opens to the skin surface next to the hair. The gland is large and spongy, located in the subcutaneous fat deep in the dermis, and has a larger overall structure and lumen diameter than the eccrine sweat gland. The secretory tubules of apocrine glands are single layered, but unlike the eccrine secretory tubules, contain only a single type of ductal epithelial cell, varying in diameter according to their location, and sometimes branching off into multiple ducts. The tubules are wrapped in myoepithelial cells, which are more developed than in their <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism {{patients}} with mutated ENaC subunits may lose significant amount salt in sweat especially at hot climates. To identify {{the sites of}} salt loss, Hanukoglu brothers examined the localization of ENaC in the human skin. In a comprehensive study examining all the layers of skin and epidermal appendages, they found a widespread distribution of ENaC in keratinocytes in the epidermal layers. Yet, in the eccrine sweat glands, ENaC was localized on the apical cell membrane exposed to the duct of these sweat glands. Based on additional observations, they concluded that the ENaC located on the <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> sweat ducts {{is responsible for the}} uptake of Na+ ions from sweat secretions. This recycling of Na+ reduces the concentration of salt in perspiration and prevents the loss of salt at hot climates via perspiration.|$|E
50|$|Some human {{sweat glands}} cannot be {{classified}} as either apocrine or eccrine, having characteristics of both; such glands are termed apoeccrine. They are larger than <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands,</b> but smaller than apocrine glands. Their secretory portion has a narrow portion similar to secretory coils in <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> {{as well as a}} wide section reminiscent of apocrine glands.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cross-reactive}} {{immune response}} which interferes with cholinergic transmission in the <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Apoeccrine, {{found in}} the armpits and perianal region, have ducts opening onto the skin surface. They are presumed to have {{developed}} in puberty from the <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands,</b> and can comprise up to 50% of all axillary glands. Apoeccrine glands secrete more sweat than both <b>eccrine</b> and apocrine <b>glands,</b> thus playing {{a large role in}} axillary sweating. Apoeccrine glands are sensitive to cholinergic activity, though they can also be activated via adrenergic stimulation. Like <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands,</b> they continuously secrete a thin, watery sweat.|$|R
5000|$|Relative to {{the plasma}} and {{extracellular}} fluid, {{the concentration of}} Na+ ions is much lower in sweat (~40 mM in sweat versus ~150 mM in plasma and extracellular fluid). Initially, within the eccrine glands, sweat has {{a high concentration of}} Na+ ions. The Na+ ions are re-absorbed into the tissue via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) that are located on the apical membrane of the cells that form the <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> ducts (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 of the reference). This re-uptake of Na+ ions reduces the loss of Na+ during the process of perspiration. Patients with the systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism syndrome who carry mutations in the ENaC subunit genes have salty sweat as they cannot reabsorb the salt in sweat. [...] In these patients, Na+ ion concentrations can greatly increase (up to 180 mmol/L).|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasma aldosterone levels and sweat sodium excretion after chronic exercise and heat acclimation was investigated, using subjects exercised, at 40 C and 45 percent humidity, for 2 h/day on ten consecutive days at 45 {{percent of their}} maximal oxygen uptake. The data indicate that, following heat acclimation, plasma aldosterone concentrations decrease, and that the <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> responsiveness to aldosterone, as represented by sweat sodium reabsorption, may be augmented through exercise and heat acclimation...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of [...] "sweat" [...] glands: True sweat <b>glands</b> or <b>eccrine</b> glands;sebaceous <b>glands,</b> which have an oily {{secretion}} around hair follicles; and apocrine glands which have more oily product than <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> and are found on the face, armpit, and groin.|$|R
50|$|Most non-primate mammals, however, have apocrine {{sweat glands}} over {{the greater part}} of their body. Domestic animals such as dogs and cats have apocrine glands at each hair {{follicle}} but <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> only in foot pads and snout. Their apocrine glands, like those in humans, produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion that gains its characteristic odor upon bacterial decomposition. <b>Eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> on their paws increase friction and prevent them from slipping when fleeing from danger.|$|R
50|$|Fabry disease, {{characterized}} by excess globotriaosylceramide (GL3), causes {{a decrease in}} sweat gland function due to GL3 deposits in the <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{cutaneous}} appendages and secretes sweat. Its principal function is thermoregulation during exposure to a hot environment or physical exercise. In addition to this function, we show that LL- 37, a member of cathelicidin family of anti-microbial peptides, is expressed in sweat. LL- 37 protein and mRNA was seen in the eccrine structures of normal human skin by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. LL- 37 was localized to both the <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> and sweat ductal epithelial cells, whereas dermcidin, a previously described natural antibiotic in sweat, was expressed only in the gland itself. The anti-microbial activity of LL- 37 and dermcidin against various bacteria in the sweat ionic environment was demonstrated by solution colony forming assay using synthetic peptides, and in sweat obtained from normal volunteers. These results indicate that cathelicidin is secreted in human sweat, has potent anti-microbial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and can, after processing from the preproform, provide a barrier for protection against infection. Thus, sweat represents a unique mode of delivery for potent innate immune effector molecules in the absence of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|CD 1 antigens are {{classified}} into {{at least three}} groups, CDla, CDlb, and CDlc. In order to delineate the localization of epitopes of CD 1 antigens in human skin, we examined the irnrnunoreactivity of fourteen different CD 1 antibodies (seven CDla, five CDlb, and two CDlc antibodies). The epitopes for CDla, CDlb, and CDlc are differentially localized on epidermal Langerhans cells, dermal dendritic cells, keratinocytes, the luminal portion of <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> ducts, and the basement membrane zone in normal human skin...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{capacitance}} mapping is a real-time {{non-invasive method}} {{useful in the}} assessment of <b>eccrine</b> <b>gland</b> activity. We presently revisit and explore the sweat gland production in pregnant women. Sprouts of sweat vapour are progressively increased during pregnancy by recruiting increasing numbers of active sweat pores. An overall moisturization of the stratum corneum ensues in absence of increased liquid sweat production. These aspects are conveniently assessed using skin capacitance mapping. The sweat duct opening could represent an increased way for percutaneous penetration of some xenobiotics during pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of giant {{vascular}} eccrine spiradenoma (GVES) {{which developed in}} 56 -yr-old Korean woman. It is a rare variant of eccrine spiradenoma (ES), which might be mistaken for angiomatous lesions in view of its florid vascularity and hemorrhagic features. Histogenesis of GVES is not clearly elucidated although {{it is known that}} ES presumably originates in the eccrine glands. To clarify the histogenesis of GVES, immunohistochemical stainings using various monoclonal antibodies were also performed. The tumor was composed of three types of cells, namely pale epithelial cells, small basal cells, and myoepithelial cells.

40|$|<b>Eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> are skin-associated {{epithelial}} structures (appendages) {{that are}} unique to some primates including humans and are absent in the skin of most laboratory animals including rodents, rabbits, and pigs. On {{the basis of the}} known importance of other skin appendages (hair follicles, apocrine glands, and sebaceous glands) for wound repair in model animals, the present study was designed to assess the role of <b>eccrine</b> <b>glands</b> in the repair of wounded human skin. Partial-thickness wounds were generated on healthy human forearms, and epidermal repair was studied in skin biopsy samples obtained at precise times during the first week after wounding. Wound reepithelialization was assessed using immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted 3 -dimensional reconstruction of in vivo wounded skin samples. Our data demonstrate a key role for <b>eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> in reconstituting the epidermis after wounding in humans. More specifically, i) <b>eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> generate keratinocyte outgrowths that ultimately form new epidermis; ii) <b>eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> are the most abundant appendages in human skin, outnumbering hair follicles by a factor close to 3; and iii) the rate of expansion of keratinocyte outgrowths from <b>eccrine</b> sweat <b>glands</b> parallels the rate of reepithelialization.
