25|$|Originally {{planned to}} house 450 patients, with {{space for a}} further 150, its {{capacity}} was reduced back to 300, with space for another 150. This was due to fears of an outcry if the local tax rate increased too sharply. At first the number of paupers admitted was low due {{to the charge of}} nine shilling per week each, this being higher than the workhouses and jails, but by force of the law the asylum was full within six months and more space was badly needed. In November of the same year, work on building extensions began to address this problem, and so started the almost continuous process of rebuilding and improvements that <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present day.|$|E

500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees.

500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Premier League in the mid-2000s was {{the dominance of the}} so-called [...] "Big Four" [...] clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive. Arsenal went as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that [...] "Big Four" [...] dominance threatened the division, [...] "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world." [...] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: [...] "There {{are a lot of different}} tussles that <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting." ...|$|E

On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another {{interview with}} Touré, D'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugars reception and [...] "was gettin' jaded, lookin' at what <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business".

2500|$|In July 2000, Howard Stern, {{the morning}} host at Infinity's WXRK, got {{the company to}} issue a gag order on their other personalities, {{preventing}} them, including Hughes and Cumia, from talking about Stern or other Infinity hosts. Three months earlier, Stern threatened management with his resignation {{if they did not}} go through with his request, after Hughes and Cumia blew the news of a surprise rock concert that Stern was to announce the following morning. Stern called Hughes and Cumia [...] "imitators" [...] who were [...] "dying to get some attention from me". In 2004, Hughes revealed a stipulation in their Infinity contract that fined Cumia and himself $100,000 if they talked about other Infinity radio personalities. In 2006, Stern admitted to the gag order: [...] "When I'm in business with a company and they hire Howard Stern imitators to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon... I don't want anyone knocking me ... I turned to Mel Karmazin ... 'Your two boys that you hired, who sound identical to me ... they're gonna go insane. Watch.'"

2500|$|On 4 February 2011, Khan {{announced}} a deal had been signed {{to defend his}} WBA title against Irish boxer and European champion Paul McCloskey in his next fight, who was unbeaten in 22 fights and was ranked world number 10. The fight was scheduled to {{take place at the}} Manchester Evening News Arena on 6 April. Khan won a sixth-round technical decision after Paul McCloskey was cut by an unintentional head-butt and could not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> estimation of the ring doctor. The heads of Khan and McCloskey collided about two minutes into the sixth round, causing a bad cut on the inside of McCloskey's left eyebrow. Another tactical few rounds followed, with Khan the main aggressor. In the decisive sixth, a five-punch combination from Khan staggered McCloskey and moments later the pair went toe-to-toe before McCloskey wheeled away and noticed blood coming from around his left eye. Khan had some trouble with the awkward and resilient southpaw, who was difficult to hit cleanly, but he was both too quick and too busy for McCloskey, winning all six rounds on all three cards. Primetime, who broadcast the fight on pay-per-view instead of Sky Box Office, reported the fight generated 70,000 buys. The fight was shown in the US on HBO and averaged 1.2 million viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Communist East German government, {{the mass}} suicide became a taboo. The {{site of the}} mass graves was {{deliberately}} not cared for, became overgrown, and was at times tilled with sugar beets. The only visible hint of the mass grave was a solitary monument with the engraved date [...] "1945",, soon also overgrown. In contrast, a [...] obelisk was erected in Demmin's burned down center to commemorate Soviet soldiers {{who had died in}} the area. The local museum listed [...] "2,300 deaths due to warfare and famine" [...] for the years of 1945 and 1946. As late as 1989, the chronicle of the district's Communist party blamed the destruction of the town on Werwolf and Hitler Youth activities. The atrocities were blamed on Germans disguised as Soviets by a document found in the local Soviet military administration in Neubrandenburg. As Der Spiegel puts it:Arbitrary executions, the rapes, the torching of towns – the atrocities of the Red Army were a taboo in the GDR, the mass suicides as well. Those who had witnessed it all or even survived a failed suicide – children, elderly, raped women – were ashamed and kept quiet. Somehow, life had to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system of the liberators. Today, many do not want to remember, for too long they had struggled to find a balance between what they had suffered and what they had learned.|$|E

James Poniewozik wrote for Time Magazine that [...] "In the end ... Big Love came back full circle to the core relationships ... We closed on a moving if messy note for a moving if messy series." [...] Mary McNamara, of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it [...] "a perfect finish to an astonishingly ambitious show that often careened through genre, narrative structure and believability like they were false walls on a stage". In her rumination on the finale, Ginia Bellafante of the New York Times noted that [...] " [...] was always at its most compelling as an indictment of the mindless spiritual avidity and the bizarre displays of self-exoneration that can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of faith," [...] and celebrated the finale for committing to that theme. She also wrote that the series had [...] "achieved the resonance of [...] other heralded series." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Dr. Ryan Vaughn was less enthusiastic about the finale but said, [...] "I'm {{not going to let}} a great series be sullied with a mediocre finale." [...] Finally, The A.V. Club awarded the series finale, and the series as a whole, a B+, writing that its first three seasons in particular qualified as [...] "remarkable television." ...|$|E
