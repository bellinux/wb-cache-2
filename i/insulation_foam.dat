50|$|Cracks and {{a region}} where a piece of foam had come off were {{discovered}} in the insulation on {{the upper part of}} the external fuel tanks. The foam came off a bracket which held an oxygen line in place. The fragment that fell off weighed 2.6 g and, according to NASA, would not be big enough to damage the shuttle if it were to come off during flight. The thermal stresses of repeated filling and emptying the fuel tank with the cryogenic fuel are known to cause a degree of damage to the <b>insulation</b> <b>foam.</b>|$|E

50|$|Refrigerators {{which contain}} ozone {{depleting}} {{and global warming}} substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), in their <b>insulation</b> <b>foam</b> or their refrigerant cycle, are the most harmful. After CFCs were banned in the 1980s, they were replaced with substances such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are ozone-depleting substances and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Both are environmentally destructive as potential global warming chemicals. If a conventional refrigerator is inefficient or used inefficiently, it will also contribute more to global warming than a highly efficient refrigerator. The use of solar energy to power refrigeration strives to minimize the negative impacts refrigerators have on the environment.|$|E
50|$|Tolerance: During the {{development}} of the RL10 engineers were worried that <b>insulation</b> <b>foam</b> mounted {{on the inside of the}} tank might break off and damage the engine. They tested this by putting loose foam in a fuel tank and running it through the engine. The RL10 chewed it up without problems or noticeable degradation in performance. Conventional gas-generators are in practice miniature rocket engines, with all the complexity that implies. Blocking even a small part of a gas generator can lead to a hot spot, which can cause violent loss of the engine. Using the engine bell as a 'gas generator' also makes it very tolerant of fuel contamination because of the wider fuel flow channels used.|$|E

KSC Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach mentioned in the post-flight news conference that upon initial inspection on the ground, [...] "Endeavour {{appears to be the}} 'cleanest' post-flight orbiter since Return to Flight".

50|$|During {{and after}} launch much {{attention}} {{was paid to}} monitoring the external tank for the loss of <b>insulation</b> <b>foam.</b> The shuttle was equipped with a number of new cameras, and video was also taken from spotter planes. Each solid rocket booster contained three cameras - one to monitor the separation, and two focused on the leading edge. The video from these was not to be broadcast, but recorded for later retrieval from the solid rocket boosters. A further camera was placed on the external tank, as during STS-114, to broadcast live images on NASA TV during launch. The first thing two of the crew from the mid-deck did when the main engines cut out was leave their seats to take photographs and video of the external tank. One of the factors that was potentially affecting the choice of day within the launch window was the lighting conditions for this imagery, as the sun's slightly different angle on the different days affected the location of shadows on the external tank. However, the day to day difference in lighting was determined to be relatively unimportant, particularly as the lighting conditions depended to a great degree on a more unpredictable factor - {{the degree to which the}} external tank tumbles on separation.|$|E

Mechanical foam is formed relatively easily, provided suitable conditions are present. The insulating character is provided by finely distributed air bubbles in the insulation layer Similar characteristics can be found in various products made of foamed concrete as well as foamed polystyrene, which are not manufactured on site but in manufacturing plants. The main objective is the formation of a porous mechanical foam on the construction site and its application onto construction elements. The foam must be stable enough to be applied to the construction surface and then solidify...|$|E
40|$|A new modular {{insulation}} panel {{technology for}} insulating reefer vans is proposed that can {{solve some of}} the problems of traditional methods. New insulating materials with lower thermal conductivity and aging rate are considered to be sandwiched in composite panels to provide better thermal performance in addition to stronger structure. The developed technology can be applied on a variety of commercial vans {{to improve the quality of}} insulation while reducing the cost and installation time of the process dramatically. The present method suggests prefabricating of modular insulation panels with accurate size in controlled conditions instead of spraying <b>insulation</b> <b>foam</b> inside the vehicles. In addition, the installation method of modular panels enables the operators to replace the damaged parts of insulation easily with less cost instead of changing the whole insulation in the old method. The MATLAB optimization toolbox is utilized to optimize the thickness of insulation panels based on energy cost and operational conditions. To validate the proposed model, a full-scale prototype is built and installed on a Ford transit connect and tested under road conditions for performance approval...|$|E

Most of the insulation systems belong to the so-called membrane type, in which the “insulation complex” is composed of a metal membrane as a barrier, a plywood panel, <b>insulation</b> <b>foam</b> and a plywood panel glued to the inner hull.
