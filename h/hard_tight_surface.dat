40|$|In Differential Geometry an {{immersed}} {{smooth surface}} in 3 -space is called tight {{if it has}} the minimum total absolute curvature among all immersed surfaces with the same topology. <b>Tight</b> <b>surfaces</b> without boundary were ex-tensively studied, and <b>tight</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{with at least two}} boundary components are known to exist. An announcement of J. H. White in 1974 [19] stated that there are no smooth <b>tight</b> orientable <b>surfaces</b> of genus at least one with exactly one boundary component. Here we disprove this statement by a family of counterexamples, starting with a smooth tight torus with one hole. The non-orientable case is also studied. We show that there is no smooth tight Möbius band in 3 -space and that there are smooth <b>tight</b> non-orientable <b>surfaces</b> of higher genus with exactly one boundary component. Three non-orientable cases of low genus remain open...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{ultrasonic}} imaging technique of <b>tight</b> crack <b>surfaces</b> themselves is proposed. Focusing the transverse wave beams at every {{point on the}} rugged cracked surface, and receiving the backscattered wave signal from that point, we can image the <b>tight</b> crack <b>surfaces</b> by the conventional Cscan. The {{ultrasonic imaging}} technique is applied to tight fatigue cracks of carbon and stainless steels with pointfocused transducers. The cracked surfaces of partial and throughthickness crack are imaged, from which the crack depth is estimated. The degree of crack closure could be evaluated by combining the higher harmonic images, which is obtained by a highpowered burst wave pulser. ...|$|R

The latter obtained a unique position among surfaces when it was shown that no smooth tight immersion of it can be formed, while a polyhedral one does exist. Continuing in its role as an unusual example, this surface has another un-expected property, demonstrated here: any tight immersion is necessarily asymmetric, while every other surface can be immersed tightly and symmetrically in space. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarly {{studies of}} <b>tight</b> <b>surfaces</b> showed {{that almost every}} surface can be {{immersed}} tightly in three-space. For these surfaces we can ask: How many significantly different tight immersions are there? If we consider two such immersions {{to be the same}} when they are image homotopic, then we can answer the question by determining the number of homotopy classes where tight immersions are possible. A complete description of all classes of immersions under image homotopy already exists, and tight examples are known in all but three of the classes where tight immersions are possible. In this paper we produce examples in two of those three missing classes, and conjecture that no tight immersion exists in the third...|$|R

40|$|At Livermore we`ve {{spent the}} last two years {{examining}} an alternative approach towards very large aperture (VLA) telescopes, one based upon transmissive Fresnel lenses rather than on mirrors. Fresnel lenses are attractive for VLA telescopes because they are launchable (lightweight, packagable, and deployable) and because they virtually eliminate the traditional, very <b>tight,</b> <b>surface</b> shape requirements faced by reflecting telescopes. Their (potentially severe) optical drawback, a very narrow spectral bandwidth, can be eliminated by use of a second (much smaller) chromatically-correcting Fresnel element. This enables Fresnel VLA telescopes to provide either single band ({Delta}{lambda}/{lambda} {approximately} 0. 1), multiple band, or continuous spectral coverage. Building and fielding such large Fresnel lenses will present a significant challenge, but one which appears, with effort, to be solvable...|$|R
