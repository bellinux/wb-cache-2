30|$|The {{recurrence}} {{pattern was}} determined {{according to the}} primary recurrence site diagnosed by imaging studies (CT, US, MRI, scintigraphy, or PET-CT), ascitic cytology, or probe laparoscopy. Locoregional LN metastasis <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence of lymphatic metastases within the D 2 lymphadenectomy area. Distant LN metastasis <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence of any LN metastasis outside the area dissected by a D 2 lymphadenectomy. Local recurrence <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence of non-lymphatic cancer tissue within the surgical area, residual stomach, or anastomotic site. Hematogenous metastasis <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence of any distant metastasis, except hepatic metastases. In case multiple metastases patterns occurred simultaneously, the dominant metastasis was determined {{based on the number}} and size of the metastatic lesions. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> period from initial surgery to the first detection of recurrence or whatever was the cause of death. Survival after recurrence (SAR) <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> period from the first detection of recurrence to the time of death.

5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally {{no more than a}} few degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms {{are used in the}} more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E

5|$|The 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season had the {{earliest}} named storm since 1992. Many storms {{formed in the}} north-east portion of the basin, and several more originated around Australia. The basin <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> waters of the Indian Ocean west of longitude 90°E to the coast of Africa {{and south of the}} equator. Eleven tropical storms formed, compared to an average of nine. Tropical systems were present during 73days, which was significantly higher than the average of 58.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{table of}} the storms in 1957 and their landfall(s), if any; the table does not include storms that did not make landfall, which <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{center of the storm}} moving over a landmass. Deaths in {{parentheses}} are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is {{defined in terms of}} force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E
50|$|The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) {{came into}} use {{in its present}} form in 1744 when 0 °C <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{freezing}} point of water and 100 °C <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere.|$|R

30|$|The {{onset of}} bipolar {{disorder}} <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first recorded diagnosis of bipolar disorder or, {{if this was}} lacking, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first recorded symptoms clearly related to bipolar disorder. In turn, a recurrent episode <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence, in a previously remitted patient, of symptoms that required either psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment. All recurrences were recorded and graded in terms of severity, polarity, and duration. Finally, remission <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> absence of affective symptoms, as measured using standard mood rating scales. All data were collected prospectively.|$|R
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Land <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} {{and anything}} permanently {{attached to the}} land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides {{that it is not}} trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
40|$|Function {{complexity}} classes <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> substitution {{closure of}} finite function sets by improving {{a method of}} elimination of concatenation recursion from function algebras.

30|$|The time to <b>the</b> {{stationary}} phase <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> time necessary {{to reach the}} first of two equal OD values within a minimum interval of 5  h. The end of glucose fermentation <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> time when glucose was exhausted (0  g/l). The end of fermentation <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> time when the fructose concentration dropped below 2  g/l. These points were used to estimate the alcoholic fermentation times (in h) and the time necessary to ferment glucose (AF 1) and fructose (AF 2), excluding the lag phase.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the {{superfamily}} Baurusuchoidea {{was established}} to include baurusuchids and sebecids.

5|$|The Fundamental Rights <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{basic human}} rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, apply {{irrespective}} of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The Directive Principles of State Policy are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing and passing law's.|$|E
5|$|The Havering {{committee}} {{area for}} Romford <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> wards of Romford Town and Brooklands.

In 2001 the population of Romford Town was 13,200 and Brooklands was 13,024, giving a total population of 26,224. In contrast, the approximate population of the area within the 2005 Romford Urban Strategy {{was estimated to be}} 36,500. 71.52% in Romford Town and 70.48% in Brooklands report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 15.71% in Romford Town and 16.62% in Brooklands report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Slavonia, as a geographical region, {{do not necessarily}} coincide with {{the borders of the}} five counties, except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them. The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both definitions of the region. In the north, the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a geographic region, but this excludes Baranya from the geographic region's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia. The western boundary of the geographic region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined through history depending on the political divisions of Croatia. The eastern Croatia, as a geographic term, largely overlaps most definitions of Slavonia. It <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> territory of the Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, including Baranya.|$|E

Fascicle length <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> distance between the intersection composed of the superficial aponeurosis and fascicle and the intersection composed of the deep aponeurosis and the fascicle. Pennation angle <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> internal angle composed of the fascicle and deep aponeurosis. Muscle thickness <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> vertical line from the superficial aponeurosis to deep aponeurosis at the centre of the ultrasonographic images.|$|R
5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If {{the mass of the}} IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The ampere too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as}} a vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, {{with the assumption that}} the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E
