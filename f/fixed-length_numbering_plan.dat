50|$|Some countries, such as Uruguay, have merged variable-length area {{codes and}} {{telephone}} <b>numbers</b> into <b>fixed-length</b> <b>numbers</b> that {{must always be}} dialed independently of location. In such closed dialing plans, also having a closed <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> the area code is formally not distinguished in the telephone number. In the UK, area codes were first known as subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes. Depending on local dialing plans, they are often necessary only when dialed from outside the code area or from mobile phones. In North America ten-digit dialing is required in areas with overlay plans.|$|R

50|$|Most {{national}} telephone administrations issue {{telephone numbers}} that {{conform to the}} E.164 numbering plan.E.164 conformant telephone numbers consist of a country calling code and a national telephone number.

50|$|Many {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> {{are structured}} based on divisions into geographic {{areas of the}} service territory. Each area identified in the plan is assigned a numeric routing code. This concept was first developed for Operator Toll Dialing of the Bell System in the early 1940s, which preceded the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> (NANP) of 1947. The system divided the North American service territories into <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> areas (NPAs), and called the numerical prefix the <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> area code, which became known in a short-form as area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number assigned.|$|R

50|$|The E.164 {{standard}} of the International Telecommunications Union {{is an international}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> and establishes a country calling code (country code) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate <b>number</b> <b>plan</b> administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national routing code (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional <b>numbering</b> <b>plans,</b> however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.|$|R
