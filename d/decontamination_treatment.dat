TTTs {{have been developed}} for pretreatment (e. g. <b>decontamination),</b> <b>treatment</b> and conditioning of specific wastes such as mixed, organic or chlorine-containing radioactive waste and contaminated soils. TTTs use powder metal fuels (PMFs) specifically formulated for the waste composition, which react with some of the waste components. Thermochemical processing can be carried out in a self-sustaining regime and enables ecologically safe processing of wastes without complex and expensive equipment.

Campylobacter is the biggest cause of foodborne disease in the UK, {{with the majority of}} human infections being linked to the handling and consumption of chicken, but public understanding of Campylobacter risk is low. Reducing Campylobacter risk is a key target for the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Slaughterhouse <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> (such as lactic acid, hot water or steam) could potentially have a significant effect in reducing the Campylobacter risk. The FSA therefore commissioned GfK NOP and Research Works to conduct a scoping study followed by a consumer survey to investigate public understanding and awareness of Campylobacter, and attitudes towards potential slaughterhouse <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> for poultry and beef, focussing on lactic acid. The scoping study consisted of a literature review plus two focus groups with consumers (not held at the UK Data Archive), while the consumer study consisted of over 2, 000 interviews with a random probability sample of those who ever buy or cook meat, including boost samples for the devolved countries. The main objective of the project was to provide a more quantifiable assessment of consumers' views specifically focussing on UK consumers': understanding and awareness of Campylobacter attitudes towards potential slaughterhouse <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> for poultry and beef, focussing on lactic acid attitudes towards potential labelling used to discourage washing of poultry Further information about this study {{can be found on the}} Food Standards Agency website.

40|$|During the {{harvesting}} process, {{meat products}} can become contaminated with enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Surrogates for these pathogens {{would be beneficial}} for validating carcass <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments.</b> Surrogate organisms are organisms that behave similarly to specific pathogens but are non-pathogenic {{and can be used}} to determine efficacy of decontamination regimes for pathogens. The surrogates proposed are non-pathogenic, ampicillin-resistant E. coli biotype I strains that were previously isolated from beef cattle hides. Each E. coli strain was transformed to express a fluorescent protein (red: EcRFP; green: EcGFP; yellow: EcYFP) that is detectable under an ultraviolet light source. Surface areas on hot boned beef carcasses (clod, brisket, outside round) were inoculated with a fecal slurry containing EcRFP, EcGFP, EcYFP and rifampicin-resistant E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium. Surface regions were then treated in a model spray cabinet using an initial water wash (28 ?C) followed by treatments using 2 % L-lactic acid (55 ?C), hot water (95 ?C at source) or a combination of the two. Treatments were compared for their effectiveness at reducing populations of inoculated (4. 7 to 6. 7 log CFU/cm 2) E. coli, S. Typhimurium, EcRFP, EcGFP and EcYFP. Log reductions for inoculated organisms were calculated individually and then total and average surrogate cocktail values were calculated. All <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> reduced the inoculated numbers of pathogens and surrogates to near or below the detection limit of 0. 5 log CFU/cm 2. The combined treatment resulted in the greatest log reductions. The three individual surrogate organisms varied in log reductions according to the different <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> applied; however, log reductions for the total surrogate cocktail did not differ significantly from that of E. coli O 157 :H 7. With the exception of EcYFP, the individual surrogates and average surrogate cocktail were significantly more resistant to microbial interventions including lactic acid than S. Typhimurium. Because abattoirs utilize different carcass <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments,</b> it is difficult for one single fluorescent protein-producing isolate to accurately represent the behavior of E. coli O 157 :H 7 or S. Typhimurium. Instead, surrogates should be used as a total cocktail to accurately represent the effectiveness of different treatments for reduction of enteric pathogens...|$|R

Objective. We aim to identify possible variations in Dutch hospital admission and <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients with acute intoxications. Materials and methods. Data on acute intoxications was retrospectively collected from patient records from the emergency departments of six Dutch hospitals. All patients older than 14 years who presented between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008 were included in the study. Results. The percentage of suicide attempts differed signifi cantly between the hospitals (25 – 73 %, p 0. 0001) as equally the percentage of intoxications with drugs of abuse (18 – 61 %, p 0. 0001). Marked differences in admission rates were found (27 – 78 %, p 0. 0001) and these differences remained even when intoxications because of suicide attempts and drugs of abuse were analysed separately (admission rate of 52 – 87 %, p 0. 0001 and 8 – 71 %, p 0. 0001 respectively).

In addition, the effects of these control methods on indigenous leaf and soil bacteria and fungi were assessed. Field plots of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), sprayed with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, or Erwinia herbicola, received the following treatments: (i) control, (ii) tillage, (iii) burning, (iv) burning plus tillage (burn-tillage), (v) Kocide (cupric hydroxide), (vi) Kocide plus tillage, (vii) Agri-Strep (streptomycin sulfate), and (viii) Agri-Strep plus tillage. Leaves and soil from the plots were sampled at 1 day before and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 30 days after application of the <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments.</b> The burn and burn-tillage treatments produced the most significant reductions in bacterial populations. The Agri-Strep treatment was more effective than the Kocide treatment in eliminating applied bacteria, but neither biocide produced consistent or persistent control. In contrast, the tillage treatment, alone or {{in combination with}} the Agri-Strep or Kocide treatments, had a short-term stimulatory effect and increased populations of applied bacteria and also levels of indigenous fungi and bacteria. Agri-Strep and Kocide treatments caused significant reductions in indigenous bacterial populations up to 14 days after application and in indigenous fungal populations on day 7 after application.

These <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> were tested individually and in combinations. Cutaneus trunci muscles from freshly slaughtered steers were inoculated with feces containing Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, and Salmonella typhimurium over a predesignated meat surface area, resulting in initial populations of ca. 5 log CFU/cm 2 of each pathogen. Tissue samples were excised from each portion before and after <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments,</b> and mean population reductions were determined. Treatment combinations evaluated were the following (treatment designations within the abbreviations indicate the order of application) : TW, TWS, WS, VW, VWS, TWLS, and VWLS. These combinations resulted in reductions ranging from 3. 5 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2 in all three pathogen populations. The TW, TWS, WS, TWLS, and VWLS combinations were equally effective (P > 0. 05), resulting in reductions ranging from 4. 2 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2. When used individually, T, V, and S resulted in pathogen reductions ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 7 log CFU/cm 2 Steam pasteurization consistently provided numerically greater pathogen reductions than T or V. Treatments T, V, and S were all more effective than W (which gave a reduction on the order of 1. 0 log CFU/cm 2) Steam pasteurization is an effective method for reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef, with multiple decontamination procedures providing greatest overall reductions...|$|R

Thus we appraised the antibacterial activity of interventions applied on poultry carcasses. Physical interventions included water-based treatments, irradiation, ultrasound, air chilling, or freezing. Especially hot water, steam, electrolyzed water (EW), and irradiation effectively reduced the bacterial load. Reductions obtained by hot water, steam, and EW mainly ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 1, 2. 3 to 3. 8, and 1. 1 to 2. 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. However, hot water or steam might exert an adverse impact on the carcass appearance. Chemical interventions primarily comprised organic acids, chlorine-based treatments, or phosphate-based treatments.

Amines were extracted with perchloric acid, derivative with dansyl chloride, separated using a reversed- phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method, and detected by fluorescence. The results showed a reduction of microbial contamination as effect of the experimental ozone treatment of carcasses. In simply chilled poultry meat (Lot C control) a significant increases of putrescine and cadaverine at 15 th days of storage. At 20 t day higher levels of putrescine (53, 63 mg/kg) and cadaverine (175, 20 mg/kg) occurred in Lot C than in treated poultry meat of Lot A. Ozone decontamination resulted in lower levels of putrescine (32, 37 mg/kg) and cadaverine (132, 30 mg/kg), and in Lot A the shelf life was 6 days longer than in Lot C. If authorized, an ozone treatment during the storage of chilled poultry meat can induce a reductio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Following {{the report}} of many cases of Legionnaires’ disease {{associated}} with accommodation facilities such as hotels, spas, workplaces, hospitals and nursing homes, we verified if Legionella pneumophila and Legionella spp. were present {{in some of those}} structures in Tuscany, in order to estimate the species and serogroups in circulation. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (30. 9 %) was the most frequently isolated species along with serogroups 3 (16. 1 %) and 6 (13. 3 %); these three serogroups are identified, in literature, as those most responsible for Legionnaires’ disease (LD). Studying all analyzed structures, we found some parts of the water system where Legionella concentration was higher than 103 CFU/L, indicated, in Italy, as the maximum admitted concentration value above which a <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatment</b> is necessary when one or more cases of healthcare-acquired Legionnaires’ disease are observed. Moreover disinfection is recommended in any case when counts exceed 104 CFU/L. Consequently, in order to prevent cases of Legionnaires’ disease, a continuous surveillance of the watersystems of all accommodation facilities is necessary, with particular attention to hospitals and nursinghomes where immunocompromised patients lodge, so as to promptly estimate the presence of the pathogen and consequently plan the most suitable intervention activities. We concluded that, in any structure, a continuous surveillance and disinfecting treatment of water systems is necessary. Moreover, after any disinfection treatment the temperature of the hot water flowing in the system must be necessarily maintained near 51 °C in order to minimize the probability of recontamination from Legionella and limit therisk of LD in consumers...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the Pulsed Light technology (PL) for its efficiency {{to reduce the}} microbial loads on mung bean sprouts and endive salad during a simulated wash process for up to 60 s. The microbicidal action of PL {{proved to be more}} efficient than the sanitizers electrolyzed water (40 ppm free chlorine) and chlorine dioxide (15 ppm) within the same treatment time. Reductions of the microbial count up to 2. 5 log were found in case of PL treated endive salad while both sanitizers only caused maximum reductions by about 1. 5 log. A combination of PL and sanitizers did not have pronounced additional effect for both endive salad and mung bean sprouts. Overall, the <b>decontamination</b> <b>treatments</b> were more effective in case of endive salad compared to mung bean sprouts. It was also shown that the microbial loads in the washing water may be kept on a low level during PL treatments as count reductions of approx. 3 log were found in relation to simply washing in tap water. This study reveals that PL may be a suitable approach to reduce microbial hazards of industrially manufactured fresh produce. The application during the washing process not only reduces microbial loads on the product surface but also efficiently inactivates suspended microorganisms in the wash water and may therefore be an alternative to sanitizers for the prevention of cross contaminations...|$|R
50|$|Gut flora {{composition}} also {{changes in}} severe illnesses, due {{not only to}} antibiotic use but also to such factors as ischemia of the gut, failure to eat, and immune compromise. Negative effects from this have led to interest in selective digestive tract <b>decontamination</b> (SDD), a <b>treatment</b> to kill only pathogenic bacteria and allow the re-establishment of healthy ones.|$|R
