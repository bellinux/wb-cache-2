5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population to worse slavery than that experienced under French rule. His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in <b>fear.</b> <b>He</b> is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Christine {{admits she}} {{is afraid of}} the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to {{recapture}} her. Raoul realizes {{that they can use}} the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in <b>fear.</b> <b>He</b> escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Artabanus III, two Jewish commoners and brothers, Anilai and Asinai from Nehardea (near modern Fallujah, Iraq), led a revolt against the Parthian {{governor}} of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus III, who feared further rebellion elsewhere. Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> would attack Anilai over his marriage to a gentile. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him. With the Jewish regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the local Jewish community, forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35–36AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local Greeks and Aramaeans. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and Nisibis.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{graduated}} from Hamilton College with a BPhil in 1905, then studied Romance languages under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered {{to write a}} PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega's plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees {{and gave him a}} travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace; he happened to be standing outside the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by anarchists of King Alfonso, and left the country for <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> would be identified with them. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the Sorbonne, followed by a week in London.|$|E

5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of <b>fear.</b> <b>He</b> improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
25|$|On {{one hand}} the stranger's opinion {{does not really}} matter because of his lack of {{connection}} to society, {{but on the other}} the stranger’s opinion does matter, because of his lack of connection to society. He holds a certain objectivity that allows him to be unbiased and decide freely without <b>fear.</b> <b>He</b> is simply able to see, think, and decide without being influenced by the opinion of others.|$|E
25|$|In August 1912, the President of Nicaragua, Adolfo Díaz, {{requested}} {{the secretary of}} war, General Luis Mena, to resign for <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> was leading an insurrection. Mena fled Managua with his brother, {{the chief of police}} of Managua, to start an insurrection. When the U.S. legation asked President Díaz {{to ensure the safety of}} American citizens and property during the insurrection, he replied he could not, and asked the United States to intervene in the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Beria's {{decision}} to avoid immediately calling a doctor was tacitly supported (or {{at least not}} opposed) {{by the rest of}} the Politburo, which was rudderless without Stalin's micromanagement and paralyzed by a legitimate <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> would suddenly recover and wreak violent reprisal on anyone who had dared to act without his orders. Stalin's suspicion of doctors in the wake of the Doctors' Plot was well known. At the time of his stroke, his private physician was already being tortured in the basement of the Lubyanka for suggesting the leader required more bed rest.|$|E
25|$|Howard is {{abducted}} {{from his}} home planet and is dropped into the Florida Everglades by the demon Thog the Nether-Spawn, Overmaster {{of the realm of}} Sominus. He meets the Man-Thing, Korrek the Barbarian, Dakimh the Enchanter and Jennifer Kale, but falls off the inter-dimensional stepping stones. He materializes in Cleveland, Ohio and battles Garko the Man-Frog, for which he is arrested for disturbing the peace and mistaken for a mutant during a strip search. Released because the police <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> has mutant abilities, he encounters Bessie the Hellcow, a vampire cow.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{soon had}} to return many of his men to Washington in order to {{reinforce}} the defeated Union force after the First Battle of Bull Run as fear {{for the security of}} the capital ran high. While Butler continued to maintain the camp at Newport News, he had to abandon the camp at Hampton for lack of men. When Magruder discovered this, on August 7, 1861, a Confederate force burned Hampton so it could no longer be used to shelter runaway slaves. Butler did not attempt to shell the Confederates from the fort for <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> would be blamed, at least in part, for the burning of the town due to cannon fire.|$|E

The operation is successful, but Mary and Tom must take over Downton's operations. Larry Merton's fiancée, Amelia, encourages Lord Merton and Isobel Crawley to renew their engagement, but Lady Violet rightly suspects Amelia wants Isobel to be Lord Merton's caretaker in his old age. Daisy and Mr Molesley score high marks on their academic exams; Molesley's are so exceptional that he is offered a teaching position at the school. Mary breaks off with Henry Talbot, unable to live with the constant <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> could be killed in a car race. Bertie Pelham proposes to Edith, but she hesitates to accept because of Marigold. Lady Violet, upset over Lady Grantham replacing her as hospital president, abruptly departs for a long cruise to restore her equanimity.|$|E
25|$|About an hour long canal {{ride from}} an embarcadero, pier, lies Isla de las Muñecas, or the Island of the Dolls. It is the best-known chinampa, or {{floating}} garden, in Xochimilco. It {{belonged to a}} man named Don Julián Santana Barrera, {{a native of the}} La Asunción neighborhood. Santana Barrera was a loner, who was rarely seen in most of Xochimilco. According to the legend, SantanaBarrera discovered a little girl drowned in mysterious circumstances in the canals. He also found a doll floating nearby and, assuming it belonged to the deceased girl, hung it from a tree as a sign of respect. After this, he began to hear whispers, footsteps, and anguished wails in the darkness even though his hut—hidden deep inside the woods of Xochimilco—was miles away from civilization. Driven by <b>fear,</b> <b>he</b> spent the next fifty years hanging more and more dolls, some missing body parts, all over the island in an attempt to appease what he believed to be the drowned girl’s spirit.|$|E
25|$|In Batman vol. 3, #16, Bane has {{recruited}} his old henchmen Bird, Trogg, and Zombie in {{his quest}} to break Batman {{once and for all}} before recapturing Psycho Pirate from Arkham Asylum. Bane hangs Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Damian Wayne in the Batcave before setting off for the asylum, but the three survive. Bane's henchmen then capture Catwoman, Duke Thomas, Commissioner Gordon, and Bronze Tiger to cut Batman off from his allies. Bane beats Batman savagely in an alley and believes him dead, but finds out that Catwoman has escaped, freed the rest of the hostages, and tied up Bane's henchmen, giving Batman a chance to flee. Enraged, Bane storms to Arkham Asylum, where Alfred is forcing Psycho Pirate to undo the <b>fear</b> <b>he</b> inflicted upon Gotham Girl. Batman decides to release many of the inmates to fight Bane and thus give himself time to heal, but Bane easily beats the likes of Two-Face, Solomon Grundy, Amygdala, Scarecrow, Firefly, and the Mad Hatter, among others, before making the Riddler open a door to Batman for him. Bane and Batman then have another fight, with a bloodied Batman barely beating his nemesis.|$|E

Nolan decided against casting an Irish actor like Murphy for Batman, before casting him as Scarecrow. Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow, and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan. Murphy explained, [...] "I wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look, because he's not a very physically imposing man – he's {{more interested in the}} manipulation of the mind and what that can do." ...|$|E
