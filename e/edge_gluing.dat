Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the lamination process will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a surfacer (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, {{there are two ways to}} finish the lamination process. One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a [...] "log cant" [...] that is slightly larger than the buyer's desired profile. These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and <b>edge</b> <b>gluing</b> and a process known as finger- jointing. Boards which would be scrap at another mill may be used in the center of a laminated log or beam to minimize waste.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the strength properties of glued laminated timber composed of edge-glued laminae and to investigate the influence of <b>edge</b> <b>gluing</b> on the strength properties. Glued laminated timber composed of multiple-grade laminae (symmetrical composition, strength grade E 95 -F 270, 10 laminations) was produced from karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) edge-glued laminae according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard. The bending, tensile, and compressive strengths of the glued laminated timber were measured. The average bending, tensile, and compressive strengths were 33.4, 24.5, and 35.9 MPa, respectively, and these values are almost equal to those of glued laminated timber composed of karamatsu single-piece laminae. It was determined that finger-joints and knots in the edge-glued laminae played a significant role in the failure of specimens. However, the use of glued edge-joints did not appear to affect the failure of specimens.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{finite element}} models of {{cross-laminated}} timber (CLT) with different laminate directions were studied. Simulations with quadratic orthotropic linear elastic finite elements were conducted. One goal was to compare in-plane shear stiffnesses for CLT blocks made up from Norway Spruce (Picea abies) boards. 3 - and 5 -layer CLT were studied with board sizes 25 x 150 x 1200 mm. Bloc sizes were 75 x 1200 x 1200 and 125 x 1200 x 1200 mm for 3 -layer and 5 -layer blocs, respectively. The first and last layers laminate directions were assumed to be in direction 0 ○. The second and fourth layers laminate directions for 5 -layer models were assumed equal and were 5 ○, 10 ○, 15 ○, 30 ○, 45 ○, 60 ○, 75 ○ and 90 ○. The middle layer was in direction 0 ○ or 90 ○. For 3 -layer models the middle layers laminate directions were 5 ○, 10 ○, 15 ○, 30 ○, 45 ○, 60 ○, 75 ○ and 90 ○. No <b>edge</b> <b>gluing</b> was assumed and thus all side edges were allowed to separate or overlap. Glued contact surfaces were assumed to be perfectly glued with rigid glue. The results for 5 -layer models showed that all models with angled second and fourth layers were stiffer than the models with 90 ○ layers. Stiffnesses for models with angled second and fourth layers were higher when the middle layer laminate direction was 90 ○ compared to 0 ○. The stiffest 5 -layer model {{was the one with}} laminate directions 0 / 45 / 90 / 45 / 0. This stiffness was 1. 5 times the shear stiffness of a reference block with 1 -layer and solid timber shear stiffness. The stiffest 3 -layer model was the one with laminate directions 0 / 30 / 0. This stiffness was 0. 99 times the shear stiffness of the reference bloc...|$|E

Wood pieces with planed and sanded surfaces were bonded using cross-linking polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and polyurethane (PUR) based adhesives, at pressures of 0. 7 MPa and 1. 0 MPa. The same adhesives were used for finger jointing at a pressure of 1. 5 MPa. The bonding strength was determined through glue-line shear strength and bending test for finger jointing. According to the results, the pressure and surface preparation variables did not influence the glue-line shear strength of the adhesive PVAc, whereas for the PUR adhesive strength was influenced by the pressures and machining used. All treatments met the minimum values required by the standard; however, the highest bonding strength was found in the sample glued with PUR adhesive at a pressure of 1. 0 MPa and sanded surface. The highest modulus of rupture was obtained in the samples glued using PVAc, while the modulus of elasticity was not affected by the type of adhesive used.

40|$|The study {{compares the}} {{strength}} of the <b>glue</b> line of <b>edge</b> <b>glued</b> panels of Pinus taeda made with different industrial adhesives. Three types of adhesives (poly(vinyl) acetate (PVAc), emulsion polymer isocyanate (EPI) and polyurethane (PU)) glued in two side gluing orientation (radial and tangential) and analyzed after the conditioning tests (dry and wet) were analyzed. The 360 specimens were prepared for determining the shear strength of <b>edge</b> <b>glued</b> panels of Pinus taeda, and these were tested in a universal testing machine called EMIC. The shear strength of the glue line at dry condition was lower in the tangential side for the three types of adhesives analyzed. The PU adhesive showed the highest values of shear strength in the applied conditions, differing from PVAc and EPI adhesive when tested on dry condition and did not differ from the others adhesives when tested on wet condition. The highest percentage of wood failure was observed after the shear strength test at dry condition to EPI adhesive glued in the radial side. And in the wet condition, the EPI adhesive and PU adhesive glued in tangential side showed higher mean values of wood failure.

40|$|Wood <b>edge</b> <b>glued</b> {{panels are}} used {{extensively}} in the furniture and cabinetry industries. They are used to make doors, tops, and sides of solid wood furniture and cabinets. Since lightly stained furniture and cabinets are gaining in popularity, there is an increasing demand to color sort the parts used to make these <b>edge</b> <b>glued</b> panels. The goal of the sorting processing is to create panels that are uniform in both color and intensity across their visible surface. If performed manually, the color sorting of edge-glued panel parts is very labor intensive and prone to error. This paper describes a complete machine vision system for performing this sort. This system uses two color line scan cameras for image input and a specially designed custom computing machine to allow real-time implementation. Users define the number of color classes {{that are to be}} used. An “out ” class is provided to handle unusually colored parts.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} symmetries and geodesics of an {{infinite}} translation surface which arises as {{a limit of}} translation surfaces built from regular polygons, studied by Veech. We find the affine symmetry group of this infinite translation surface, and we show that this surface admits a deformation into other surfaces with topologically equivalent affine symmetries. The geodesics on these new surfaces are combinatorially {{the same as the}} geodesics on the original. In this paper, we begin a systematic study of the geometric and dynamical properties of the surface S 1 shown below. This surface arises from a limit of surfaces built from two affinely regular n-gons as n→∞. Figure 1. The surface S 1 is built from two infinite polygons in the plane: The convex hulls of the sets {(n, n 2) : n ∈ Z} and {(n,−n 2) : n ∈ Z}. Roman numerals indicate <b>edges</b> <b>glued</b> by translations. This study is motivated by work of Veech, [Vee 89], which shows that translation surfaces built in a similar manner from two regular polygons have special geometric and dynamical properties. We describe aspects of [Vee 89] in section 1. In short, these surfaces exhibit affine symmetries analogous to the action of SL(2,Z) on the square torus. The surface S 1 also has affine symmetries described by a lattice in SL(2,R). Furthermore, we will explain how S 1 arises from a limit of Veech’s surfaces built from regular polygons. However, previous geometric and dynamical theorems on such surfaces do not directly apply to S 1 because this surface has infinite area, infinite genus, and two cone singularities with infinite cone angle. This motivates the question: Does the infinite genus surface S 1 exhibi...|$|R
