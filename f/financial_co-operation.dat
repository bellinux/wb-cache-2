2500|$|While in {{the offing}} of an ASEAN common currency, {{the leaders of the}} member-states of ASEAN agreed in November 1999 to create the {{establishment}} of currency swaps, and repurchase agreements, as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, the finance minister of the ASEAN agreed through the [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] to plan for closer monetary and <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation.</b> The [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] or CMI, named after the City of Chiang Mai in Thailand, has two components: an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement, and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The ASEAN Swap Arrangement or ASA preceded the regional financial crisis. ASA was originally established by the ASEAN central bank and monetary authorities of the five founding members of ASEAN with a view to help countries meet temporary liquidity problems. An expanded ASA now includes all ten ASEAN countries with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has a combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for members which may be in balance-of-payments difficulties. In 200, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) have been successfully concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion. The original CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 which took effect on 20 March 2014, while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement with a total size of US$240 billion, governed by a single contractual agreement, while the CMI is a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the [...] "Plus Three" [...] and ASEAN countries' authorities. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse regional economies, and to support the CMIM decision-making process. The amendments will effectively allow access of the ASEAN+3 member countries and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an International Monetary Fund program from 20%–30%, [...] and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.|$|E

Coastcare, one of Australia's suite of coastal programs under the National Heritage Trust, had the principle objective of engaging local community {{in managing the}} coast. Coastcare represented an internationally unique example of an operational Integrated coastal managernent (ICM) initiative. The Program fulfilled the requirements of an integrated approach including intergovernmental <b>co-operation,</b> <b>financial</b> commiûnent and community involvement. ICM has been adopted internationall¡ during the last decade, as a sound approach for ecologically sustainable development and for coastal resource use planning. Despite the acceptance and abundance of ICM eftorts around the world, little critical analysis of programs is available. Many {{of the most complex}} aspects of integration - the development of relationships and trust between agency and community were beginning to emerge through Coastcare. This thesis demonstrates that within each of the states and the Northern Territory the Coastcare program functioned quite distinctly âs a consequence of the existence and prominence of individual state coastal policies, state coastal agency commitment to the program, finances available to buttress the program beyond the state/CoÍrmonwealth formula as well as social, cultural and demographic features. Coastcare's contribution to a participatory style of management is assessed by this thesis. Stakeholder interview responses were analysed according to an evaluation framework, based on the principles of participatory democracy, and designed to assess different elements of community participation. This thesis concludes that one of Coastcare's greatest strengths lies in its active capacity building. The active engagement of groups undertaking localised works has raised awareness of coastal processes and coastal management governance and systems. The study contributes to a greater understanding of the processes of an integrated approach to coastal management by providing a detailed analysis of the various pathways of communication and cooperation between Program stakeholders (Commonwealth, state and local government, the program team and community) that have developed through Coastcare. Factors assisting the three tiers of government and community working together are explored along with the barriers that impeded progress of the Program. Its achievements will contribute towards a greater understanding of sustainable approaches to coastal managementThesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{explains}} the ideational sources of China’s proactive multilateral diplomacy towards Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> by employing a learning thesis. Challenging prominent materialist explanations (power-transition thesis, realist balancing thesis and economic utility thesis), this study {{argues that the}} collective learning of Chinese policy elites through cognitive dissonance, feedback effects and transnational persuasion explains much {{of the change in}} China’s relational identity and philosophical beliefs regarding regional co-operation. These prior ideational shifts helped to determine China’s behaviour change from its muted opposition to Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in the 1990 s to its active support of regional <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in the early 2000 s, as evidenced in the emergence of the Chiang Mai Initiative, Chinese–Japanese–South Korean trilateral <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> and the Asian Bond Fund Initiative. Chinese learning also suggests that more fundamental changes in China’s national preference may make its support for Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> more consistent and stable in the foreseeable future than sceptics might anticipate. Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> is emerging, and China is an important cause. What has motivated China to support Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in recent years? Does this policy simply reflect a temporary tactic to change the interstate power configuration in China’s favour as many structural realists suggest? Or is it conceivable that more fundamental changes in China’s national preference will make its support for Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> more consistent and stable in the foreseeable future than sceptics might anticipate? This article provides an ideational explanation for China’s multilateral diplomacy towards Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation.</b> In so doing, it intends to shed light on the general question of whether and how a rising authoritarian power such as China can learn to co-operate in an era of economic globalization (that is, preference change). The central argument {{of this study is that}} the collective learning of Chinese policy elites through cognitive dissonance, feedback (or legitimacy) effects an...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explains}} the ideational sources of China's proactive multilateral diplomacy towards Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> by employing a learning thesis. Challenging prominent materialist explanations (power-transition thesis, realist balancing thesis and economic utility thesis), this study {{argues that the}} collective learning of Chinese policy elites through cognitive dissonance, feedback effects and transnational persuasion explains much {{of the change in}} China's relational identity and philosophical beliefs regarding regional co-operation. These prior ideational shifts helped to determine China's behaviour change from its muted opposition to Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in the 1990 s to its active support of regional <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in the early 2000 s, as evidenced in the emergence of the Chiang Mai Initiative, Chinese-Japanese-South Korean trilateral <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> and the Asian Bond Fund Initiative. Chinese learning also suggests that more fundamental changes in China's national preference may make its support for Asian <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> more consistent and stable in the foreseeable future than sceptics might anticipate.

40|$|Despite {{a plethora}} of {{programs}} for increased <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in Asia, there has been very little real progress in developing a regional architecture for <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in Asia. While the risks of repetition of 1997 - 98 style financial crisis in Asia are not high today, there are new risks of financial turbulence originating from sub-prime crisis in the US and new opportunities for using the financial strength of the region for accelerated growth with equity. To guard against these risks and to exploit these opportunities, a bold new initiative {{in the region is}} needed. The idea of Asian Monetary Fund proposed by Japan in 1998 needs to be revived, perhaps with a different nomenclature and a different terms of reference. This paper proposes a Reserve Bank of Asia which will be a combination of IMF and the World Bank at regional level. In order to respond to the current crisis, the major players in the region should develop a consensus on the outline of a regional financial architecture and call a conference of EAS countries to prepare Articles of Agreement for the institution much as was done at Bretton Woods some sixty years ago. monetary, Crisis...|$|E
40|$|On May 24 th it was {{announced}} that two-thirds of ACP states had now ratified the Cotonou agreement and lodged the legal instruments. This is the minimum level of support necessary for the entry into force of the Agreement. However, the Agreement can only enter into force when all 15 EU member states have ratified it. To date only six have done so. Comment: Two years after its signing the Cotonou Agreement has not yet fully entered into force. This primarily affects the <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> provisions since no 9 th EDF funds can legally be spent until the process of ratification has been completed.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} work of the little-studied Economic and Financial Organisation of the League of Nations. It offers a {{sustained}} investigation into how this international organisation operated that assesses the transnational aspects of its work in relation to its inter-governmental responsibilities, and demonstrates the wide-ranging contribution of the organisation's secretariat. The second part of the article establishes the way in which transnationalism enabled the United States, the League's most influential non-member, to {{play a crucial role in}} shaping the policy agenda of the League. It also shows how a growing sense of frustration in its work prompted EFO to attempt to free itself from inter-governmental oversight and become an independent organisation to promote economic and <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation</b> in 1940 – a full four years before the creation of the Bretton Woods agreements...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} Official Development Assistance (ODA) {{is defined as}} {{resource}} flows from international community {{in the form of}} grants, technical assistance, support and <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation.</b> Government is held partially responsible or accountable for the management of these resources but not accountable for utilization of direct support to NGOs and private sector. According to the National Treasury’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) 2010 Review Report, the Eastern Cape is the second largest recipient of ODA in relation to other provinces. The province of KwaZulu Natal, ranked number one, and the province of Limpopo was recorded as the third largest recipient of ODA. As such it is recorded that European Union is the greatest funder in the provincial government focusing in the areas of Health, Urban renewal and Local Economic Development source (National Treasury ODA 2010 Review Report). To date, no analysis has been done on ODA in the Eastern Cape. This study seeks to analyse Official Development Assistance in Eastern Cape with a view to identifying constraints and gaps that may be contributing towards the ineffectiveness of ODA in the Eastern Cap...|$|E
40|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam has {{enlarged}} the {{acquis communautaire}} of the European Union by a chapter concerning the common employment strategy. It {{focuses on the}} co-ordination of active measures. In this paper it is examined, whether {{active labour market policy}} may cause problems, which only occur in a monetary union and necessitate the co-operation of the member states on the European level. Indeed, the so-called stability pact impedes new debts and the lack of nominal exchange rates as an instrument of adjustment intensifies intra-Union tax competition. The resulting sub-optimal level of active labour market policy can be raised by <b>financial</b> <b>co-operation.</b> On the other hand, a centralised employment strategy is the consequence of political efforts to involve the European Central Bank (ECB). If the ECB resists the political pressure and concentrates on internal price stability, fiscal co-ordination will lead to an excessive use of active labour market policy and affect European competitiveness on the world markets. Eventually, social costs will be higher than in the non-co-operative equilibrium. Game-theory, co-ordination, employment policy, active labour market policy, European Union...|$|E
