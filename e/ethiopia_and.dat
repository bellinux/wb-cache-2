5|$|Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} 2:24:43, {{the only time}} in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to <b>Ethiopia</b> <b>and</b> did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa.

However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.|$|E
5|$|Edward Ullendorff {{considered}} the German orientalist Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704) {{to be the}} founder of Ethiopian studies in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the history of <b>Ethiopia</b> <b>and</b> the Ge'ez language, as well as Amharic. The Ethiopian monk Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658), while lobbying the Propaganda Fide in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by Ethiopian emperor Fasilides, collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with critical information for composing his Historia Aethiopica and its Commentaries. The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric António d'Andrade (1610–1670) aided them as a translator, since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian. After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited <b>Ethiopia,</b> <b>and</b> German orientalist August Dillmann (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers {{in the field of}} early Ethiopian studies. After spending time at the Ethiopian royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit Ethiopian historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on native Ethiopian sources. Dillmann cataloged a variety of Ethiopian manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae, the first such lexicon to be published on languages of Ethiopia since Ludolf's work.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, {{continued}} to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms.

5|$|Large-scale {{growth of}} the city began in 1991, with the massive arrival of {{immigrants}} from the Soviet Union and <b>Ethiopia</b> <b>and</b> infrastructure development. From 1990 to 2001 the city accepted more than 100,000 new inhabitants, a 150% growth. Five more quarters of the city were completed.

5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian immigrant community, which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also began to see an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, <b>Ethiopia,</b> <b>and</b> Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other American cities. Despite this increase, the foreign-born population of the St. Louis region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis baboon, {{is a member of}} the family Cercopithecidae (Old World monkeys).

Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E
