Barrett moved back to London {{and within a few}} months she was given the role of assistant editor of the WSPU newspaper, The Suffragette, on its launch in October 1912. Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism". By taking on the job she also took on the risks connected with the increasingly militant WSPU. She travelled under cover to Paris to meet with Christabel Pankhurst, and when speaking to <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> she recalled how she [...] "could always hear the click of Scotland Yard listening in." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

She told her husband of her assistance from the Kennedys, which her husband took as the reason [...] "why everybody is suddenly being so polite." [...] Regarding the March on Washington, Coretta said, [...] "It was as though heaven had come down." [...] Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services. Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to Wyatt Walker, this according to author Taylor Branch, made her portrayed by reports as [...] "an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality." ...|$|E

Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E
2500|$|Count 1 of {{the charges}} was {{conspiracy}} to commit child abduction, false imprisonment, and extortion. Janet Arvizo claimed {{she and her family}} had been held captive at Neverland as well as at a couple of hotels when traveling with Jackson. She expressed her mistrust of [...] "the Germans," [...] Dieter Weisner and Ron Konitzer. She testified that they pretended to want to protect her, telling her the rebuttal video [...] "would appease the killers," [...] but that [...] "Michael, Ronald, Dieter, Frank, and Vinnie...ended up being the killers." [...] At one point, Janet testified that she'd known what questions she'd be asked in the rebuttal video, that Frank [...] "went over" [...] them with <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> beforehand and told her to praise Michael. [...] On another day of her testimony, she claimed [...] "the Germans" [...] had scripted every word of the video, even the hand-holding, laughing, and the outtakes when they appear to think the camera isn't on, and the Germans had [...] "worked with [...] daily, numerous times" [...] to learn it all. House manager Jesus Salas testified that the accuser's mother was at no time held at Neverland against her will and that she had never complained of her children being taken advantage of at Neverland. Other staff testified that the idea that the family were prisoners of Neverland was ludicrous, that there was no fence surrounding the property and that the guards did not carry weapons. [...] During their alleged captivity, the Arvizos took shopping trips into town, billing $3,312.05 worth of purchases to Michael Jackson. They also met with their lawyer and visited a Federal building during this time, making phone calls to various people, though never the police. [...] Janet testified that she was dropping hints [...] "in code" [...] about her kidnapping during the calls, and explained that she never openly asked anyone for help because of the death threats Jackson's co-conspirators allegedly made toward her parents. Janet and Star claimed that Jackson was preventing them from knowing times or dates. When Mesereau pointed out that there were clocks visible [...] "almost everywhere" [...] in Neverland, including a giant [...] "flower clock" [...] on a prominent hill, Star admitted that he was surrounded by clocks but claimed that they had the wrong times. Janet's claims included that she was restricted to [...] "one meal per day," [...] and that Jackson's associates had threatened to make her children [...] "disappear" [...] via hot-air balloon. The Arvizos [...] "escaped" [...] Neverland three times (in Rolls-Royces and limos) but were [...] "convinced" [...] to return each time. When the prosecution presented a complicated chart of phone calls between Jackson's [...] "unindicted co-conspirators" [...] trying to show that they were scheming about the Arvizos' captivity, they accidentally proved that Jackson was not even at Neverland for several of the days during the 2 1/2-week time frame given for the alleged molestation and may have been in Miami the day the molestation and conspiracy were alleged to have started.|$|E
