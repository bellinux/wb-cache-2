5|$|In 1940, Collins, then aged 51, married 24-year-old Marjorie Paine, the {{daughter}} of a race steward. The marriage produced a son before ending in divorce eleven years later; a petition served by Collins was not defended by his wife. After his divorce, Collins continued to frequent gambling clubs at Kings Cross, participating in all-night poker sessions. Despite giving up smoking late in life, his lungs <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> and he died of cancer in 1959, aged 70.|$|E
5|$|Krueger came to {{feel that}} the {{prospects}} for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of neuritis in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, <b>failed</b> <b>him.</b> In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was {{not satisfied with the}} complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E

5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the war was over, the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> and he died in early 1816.|$|E
25|$|Later {{commentators}} on Campbell's {{poetry and}} Hazlitt's extravagant praise of it have noted this as one instance in The Spirit of the Age where Hazlitt's judgement <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> {{his enthusiasm for}} Campbell's poetry having been carried too far. Recent critical assessment has rated Campbell's poetry, now mostly forgotten, far lower than Hazlitt here did.|$|E

25|$|These results {{caught the}} eye of Count Domenico Agusta who signed Agostini to ride for his MV Agusta squad as Mike Hailwood's teammate. Agostini then fought a season-long battle with Honda's Jim Redman for the 1965 350cc world championship. He seemed to have the title won when he led the final round in Japan at Suzuka when his bike <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> handing the title to Redman.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the third}} repulse on March 16, Lieutenant Commander Smith's health <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> completely, {{and he turned}} command over to Lieutenant Commander James P. Foster. Foster and Ross decided to {{withdraw}} to the Mississippi. They were temporarily persuaded to try again when they met reinforcements for the Army, but they resumed their retreat when the new army commander, Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, saw the futility of further attacks. The entire force had returned by April 12, and the expedition was over.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign, Barclay de Tolly {{was twice}} obliged {{to send him}} away from the army due to his disorderly conduct. His share in the battles in Germany and France was insignificant. At Dresden, on 26 August, his {{military}} knowledge <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> at the decisive moment, but at La Fère-Champenoise he distinguished himself by personal bravery. In Paris the grand duke excited public ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads. His first visit was to the stables, and it was said that he had been marching and drilling even in his private rooms.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, Thompson {{returned}} to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt {{he was forced to}} take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> completely in 1851.|$|E
25|$|His health, never robust {{following}} the two yellow fever bouts, again <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> and Mason {{asked for and}} received administrative duty. In April 1863, Mason was assigned to muster and recruit duty, first in Ohio (where he also commanded Camp Thomas {{for more than a}} year), and {{for the last two years}} of the war in California as an Adjutant General, and finally in the new state of Nevada. He was promoted to Major of the 17th U.S. Infantry in the Regular Army in 1864.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, he played only two more Tests in the 1972–73 season against Pakistan. He took eight wickets {{but it was his}} batting which {{attracted}} the most attention. With Australia faltering at 8/101 in its second innings in the Third Test, with only a 75 run lead, Massie combined with John Watkins to add 83. Massie made 42 and Australia managed to win the Test and the series. Massie’s health <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> on the 1973 West Indies tour and he was unable to recover his swing and accuracy. He played only a further five first class matches before retiring.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Ras retired {{at the age}} of 66. It was not a happy {{development}} for him. He missed his work, and his health gradually <b>failed</b> <b>him.</b> He became a grandfather for the first time {{around the turn of the}} millennium, but was increasingly afflicted with Parkinson's disease. After an attack of pneumonia in 2000, it was no longer possible to live at home. He was moved to a nursing home in the village of Warmond, near Leiden, in August 2002, where, nursed with loving care by Widjiati till the end, he died on 22 October 2003.|$|E
25|$|In {{recording}} {{the words of}} his teachers, Judah used extreme care, and frequently stated explicitly that his authority for a given saying was uncertain, and that his informant did not know positively whether it was Rav's or Samuel's (Ḥul. 18b). His own memory, however, never <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> and the traditions recorded by him are reliable. When his brother Rami says, in one place, that a certain sentence of Rav's, quoted by Judah, should be disregarded (Ḥul. 44a), he does not question the accuracy of Judah's citation, but implies that Rav had afterward abandoned the opinion quoted by Judah, and had, in a statement which the latter had not heard, adopted an opposite view.|$|E
25|$|Itagaki creates {{his game}} {{characters}} by immersing himself in their roles and the games. This {{is a reason}} why he objects to the suggestion of Kasumi in the Ninja Gaiden universe, saying her 'soft' nature is conflicting with the 'hard-edged' nature of the game whereas Ayane perfectly fits in. It is this role immersion which helps him to develop and exclude guns from the moveset of the Spartan named Nicole in Dead or Alive 4. However, immersing himself in the games' atmosphere has also <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> at times. The Butt Battle, and Tug-of-War of Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 were heavily panned {{on the basis of}} minigame design. Itagaki defended those games as nostalgia comedic pieces, meant to make the player remember the celebrity games played on Japanese television.|$|E

25|$|The Sassanids never {{mounted a}} truly {{effective}} {{resistance to the}} pressure applied by the initial Arab armies. Yazdegerd was a boy {{at the mercy of}} his advisers and incapable of uniting a vast country crumbling into small feudal kingdoms, {{despite the fact that the}} Byzantines, under similar pressure from the newly expansive Arabs, no longer threatened. Caliph Abu Bakr's commander Khalid ibn Walid, once one of Muhammad's chosen companions-in-arms and leader of the Arab army, moved to capture Iraq in a series of lightning battles. Redeployed to the Syrian front against the Byzantines in June 634, Khalid's successor in Iraq <b>failed</b> <b>him,</b> and Muslims were defeated in the Battle of the Bridge in 634, which resulted in a Sassanid victory. However, the Arab threat did not stop there and reappeared shortly from the disciplined armies of Khalid ibn Walid.|$|E
25|$|When {{they return}} to the mainland, the Ghostbusters find that Ilyssa was {{captured}} and the Containment Unit shut down once again, releasing the ghosts, and suspect that Peck is trying to call forth a Supreme Destructor. A massive mausoleum appears in Central Park and the team fights {{their way into the}} central structure. Inside, they find both Ilyssa and Peck chained to walls and discover that Ivo Shandor has possessed Mayor Mulligan, using Peck as a scapegoat to avoid detection. Shandor reveals that he wishes to take Gozer's place as a god, the latter having <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> twice. The Ghostbusters are able to exorcise Shandor from the Mayor before he can sacrifice Ilyssa as part of a ritual, but are pulled into the Ghost World where they are forced to fight Shandor in his Destructor form, a Satanic being called the Architect. They manage to defeat Shandor by crossing their Proton Streams, and return to the real world, where they rescue Ilyssa, Peck, and the Mayor before the mausoleum collapses.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, when Genie was 20 months old, her {{paternal}} grandmother {{died in a}} hit-and-run traffic accident. Her death affected Genie's father far beyond normal levels of grief, and because his son had been walking with her he held his son responsible, further heightening his anger. When the truck's driver received only a probationary sentence for both manslaughter and drunk driving, he became delusional with rage. Scientists believed these events made him feel society had <b>failed</b> <b>him</b> and convinced him {{he would need to}} protect his family from the outside world, and that in doing so he lacked the self-awareness to recognize the destruction his actions caused. Because Genie's father believed Genie was severely mentally retarded he thought she needed additional protection from society, and therefore decided he needed to entirely hide her existence. He immediately quit his job and moved his family into his mother's two-bedroom house, where he insisted on leaving his mother's car and bedroom completely untouched as shrines to her, and further increased the family's isolation.|$|E
