5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and <b>Hydrography,</b> Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|As {{few other}} {{persons in the}} Confederate {{government}} were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, {{as well as the}} navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and <b>Hydrography.</b> Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title {{until the end of the}} war. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.|$|E
25|$|Maritime history also {{deals with}} the {{development}} of navigation, oceanography, cartography and <b>hydrography.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Wicklow Mountains are {{the source}} of several major river systems. Since the thin blanket bog peats cannot hold great {{quantities}} of water, many of these rivers exhibit a flashy <b>hydrography,</b> filling rapidly after heavy rain.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a rugged}} area with little vegetation, which is over 1,500 m having distintive species, ecology, relief and <b>hydrography.</b> The region is {{protected}} by provincial law, and that this region basin {{is head of the}} vast majority of streams that run through the Córdoba.|$|E
25|$|Hydrology is {{the study}} of the movement, distribution, and quality of water {{throughout}} the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is <b>hydrography.</b> The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, of glaciers is glaciology, of inland waters is limnology and distribution of oceans is oceanography. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of ecohydrology.|$|E
25|$|Both {{locations}} for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning geology, <b>hydrography</b> and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers {{was created in}} October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operated from naval base HMS Tormentor in Hamble, were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a Landing Craft Personnel (Large), or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.|$|E
25|$|For {{acoustic}} <b>hydrography</b> and bathymetry, {{the ship}} had a deep-water echosounder, a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To process data, she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a punched paper tape for shore-based processing of sounding dara.|$|E
25|$|In 1660, Riquet {{found the}} {{solution}} to the main problem: the water supply to the summit point to feed both sides of the canal. His idea was to get water flowing from the Black Mountain. His important knowledge of the <b>hydrography</b> of the Black Mountain and Sor allowed him to imagine an ingenious irrigation system. He was inspired by the French engineer Adam de Craponne who had implemented the same system for the Craponne Canal.|$|E
25|$|The FSC {{concept was}} brought {{forward in the}} 2008 budget, {{at the expense of}} options for two Type 45 destroyers not being taken up (ships 7 and 8). In 2009 BAE Systems {{received}} a contract to design the C1 and C2 frigates with a planned 25-year life. A total of 18 vessels (10 C1 and 8 C2) were planned to enter service from 2020, at a pace of roughly one per year. In early 2010 the C3 variant was dropped in favour of the Mine Countermeasures, <b>Hydrography</b> and Patrol Capability (MHPC) programme.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Hydrographic Service is {{an element}} of the RAN, and serves both {{military}} and civilian functions. The headquarters of the agency is at the Australian Hydrographic Office in Wollongong, New South Wales. Hydrographic services provided by the AHS include the mapping and surveying of undersea terrain and irregularities on and under the water's surface (known collectively as <b>hydrography),</b> the provision of nautical charts and other publications, such as tide tables and Notices to Mariners. Over 400 paper charts are produced by the AHS, with conversion of these to electronic navigational chart format due to be completed in 2011.|$|E
25|$|After {{ordination}} Lauzon {{was sent}} to Canada, in 1716. From 1716 to 1718 he was Father Pierre-Daniel Richer's assistant at the mission at Lorette. There he studied the Huron and Iroquois languages. He did missionary duty at Sault St. Louis (Caughnawaga) from 1718 to 1731. He made his solemn profession of the four vows at Sault St. Louis on February 2, 1721. He was absent from Sault St. Louis only for the scholastic year 1721-22, when he replaced Father François Le Brun as instructor in the royal school of <b>hydrography</b> in the college at Quebec, as the exhausting labours of the mission had undermined his health.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{purposes}} the ships were intended for were minesweeping and anti-submarine escort. However, the corvettes found themselves performing {{a wide range}} of duties, including troop and supply transport, bombardment, assault landings support, survey and <b>hydrography</b> mapping, and providing aid to disabled ships. The Bathursts were seen as 'maids of all work' by the RAN, even though the design was inappropriate for some roles; being too small, too slow, or inadequately armed or equipped. It was not until March 1943 that sufficient ships were available to take the individual variations and capabilities of the Bathursts into account: prior to this, the first (and often only) available vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Indus valley developed a system of standardization, using weights and measures, evident by the excavations made at the Indus valley sites. This technical standardization enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Calibration was also found in measuring devices along with multiple subdivisions in case of some devices. One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides {{in order to build}} such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary <b>hydrography</b> and maritime engineering.|$|E
25|$|After {{the retreat}} {{of the ice}} sheet that covered the region after the last ice age, the river found itself rerouted by an esker onto a plain uniquely ribbed by the ridges of other eskers, where it formed a {{succession}} of rapids and wide bays (called fjärdar), which the river inundates during the spring floods. This particular <b>hydrography,</b> along with the park's proximity to the ecological frontier {{between the north and}} the south, has favored the development of a fauna and flora of great biodiversity. The park possesses coniferous, mixed, and broadleaf forests, some of which quite ancient, spared by the logging industry because of their inaccessibility. These forests constitute the ideal environment for numerous species, in particular birds, with critical densities of woodpeckers and owls.|$|E
25|$|Officer {{training}} is conducted at Indian Naval Academy (INA) at Ezhimala, {{on the coast}} of Kerala. Established in 2009, it is the largest naval academy in Asia. Cadets from National Defence Academy also move to INA for their later terms. The Navy also has specialized training establishments for gunnery, aviation, leadership, logistics, music, medicine, physical training, educational training, engineering, <b>hydrography,</b> submarines etc. at several naval bases along the coastline of India. Naval officers also attend National Defence College and Defence Services Staff College for various staff courses to higher staff appointments. A dedicated wing for naval architecture under Directorate of Naval Architecture at IIT Delhi is operated by the Navy. Indian Navy also trains officers and men from the navies of friendly foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Fish Hawk {{also was}} {{outfitted}} to conduct general scientific {{research related to}} fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring {{the temperature of the}} sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet; 1,829 meters) of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a 9-foot (2.75-meter) beam trawl, an 11-foot (3.6-meter) beam trawl, a 17-foot (5.2-meter) beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with deck swabs or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants. For <b>hydrography,</b> she had a sounding machine with 600 fathoms (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of piano wire, deep-sea reversing thermometers, and density salinometers.|$|E
25|$|In June 1899, after {{condemnation}} {{as being}} unseaworthy and with temporary repairs in Mobile, Alabama, in April, Bache {{was used for}} extensive surveys in more sheltered locations in the northern Chesapeake Bay. June work was in Baltimore, Maryland, and by August the shipboard party, under Assistant Welker, was combining topographic and hydrographic work {{in the vicinity of}} Kent Island, Maryland. By {{the end of the season}} triangulation, shoreline, topography and <b>hydrography</b> extended from Kent Island to the Miles River. Bache finished the season December 7, 1899, and went into winter quarters in Baltimore until May 14, 1900. Between May 26 and 29 the ship went to Norfolk to observe a total eclipse of the sun, returning to Baltimore to prepare for the same combined topographical and hydrographic work below the Potomac River. She finished her last survey and broke off on December 17, 1900, to arrive in New York on December 17, 1900.|$|E
25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron diagonal braces, and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water <b>hydrography,</b> holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General of the Army Omar Bradley, had {{predicted}} that [...] "large scale combined amphibious operations... will never occur again," [...] but by July 1950, MacArthur was planning {{just such an}} operation. MacArthur compared his plan with that of General James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, and brushed aside the problems of tides, <b>hydrography</b> and terrain. In September, despite lingering concerns from superiors, MacArthur's soldiers and marines made a successful landing at Inchon, deep behind North Korean lines. Launched with naval and close air support, the landing outflanked the North Koreans, recaptured Seoul and forced them to retreat northward in disarray. Visiting the battlefield on 17 September, MacArthur surveyed six T-34 tanks that had been knocked out by Marines, ignoring sniper fire around him, except {{to note that the}} North Korean marksmen were poorly trained.|$|E
2500|$|Then, {{the code}} permits to {{interpolate}} the labeled data {{in terms of}} spatial location and <b>hydrography.</b> By taking a weighted average of the four closest casts from the labeled data set, it enables to assign [...] values to any arbitrary hydrographic data.|$|E
2500|$|Its fame was in {{philosophy}} and mathematics, through (or in competition with) the Jesuit college in particular. [...] "The Faculty of Arts offers three chairs (history, Hebrew, Greek) until 1704, when a chair of mathematics was created (...). A chair in <b>hydrography</b> {{has been in}} place since 1704." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dryads {{visits to}} Ascension Island brought welcome {{relief to the}} crew from the torrid climate of West Africa, as well as fresh {{provisions}} and time ashore for recreation. It also gave them time to water, refit and paint her. Dryad carried out <b>hydrography,</b> too. [...] In 1832 The Nautical Magazine recorded one such occasion: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{activities in}} amphibious reconnaissance was largely limited in surveying [...] of ports, uncharted islands and adjacent beaches or coastlines. [...] Most of these duties were billeted by senior Naval Intelligence Officers that were prerequisites in topography, [...] <b>hydrography,</b> [...] impermanent construction of fortification {{with the means}} of rapid encampment and mobilization of troops to operate in their area.|$|E
2500|$|Reports of Assistant R. B. Derickson, {{commanding}} Research {{during the}} fiscal year 1903 reporting period indicate {{the nature of the}} work undertaken. Triangulation and navigation bases were established along with tide gauges and then topographic and hydrographic surveys were begun. Inshore <b>hydrography</b> was done by [...] "the whaleboat and alco-vapor launch" [...] while offshore survey to 20 fathoms was done by casting the lead and in deeper water by the sounding machine.|$|E
2500|$|The port {{was widely}} {{used during the}} 18th century; in 1789 it was visited by 80 ships. Saint-Tropez's shipyards built tartanes and three-masted ships that could carry 1,000 to 12,200 barrels. The town {{was the site of}} various {{associated}} trades, including fishing, cork, wine, and wood. The town had a school of <b>hydrography.</b> In 1860 the floret of the merchant marine, named [...] "The Queen of the Angels" [...] (a three-masted ship of 740 barrels capacity), visited the port.|$|E
2500|$|For {{acoustic}} <b>hydrography</b> and bathymetry, Whiting had [...] 12-Khz deep-water echosounder, a 100-kHz shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, a 24- and 100-kHz {{hydrographic survey}} sounder, and the Intermediate Depth Swath Survey System (IDSSS), {{which is a}} 36-kHz sidescan sonar. In 1989 she underwent a major upgrade involving the installation of Hydrochart II, which employed a Microvax computer system to acquire and process hydorgraphic data. Hydrochart II gave her the capability to generate bottom contour charts with a swath [...] width of approximately two-and-a-half times the water depth, ranging from 10 ...|$|E
2500|$|Chemical {{contaminants}} such as persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g., Hg, Cd, Pb, Ni), radioactive compounds, pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals {{are also}} accumulating in deep-sea sediments. Topography (e.g. presence of canyons) and <b>hydrography</b> (e.g., cascading events) {{play a major}} role in the transportation and accumulation of these chemicals from the coast and shelf to the deep basins, affecting the local fauna. Recent studies have detected the presence of significant levels of dioxins in the commercial shrimp Aristeus antennatus [...] and significant levels of persistent organic pollutants in mesopelagic and bathypelagic cephalopods ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Brooke {{resigned}} from the U.S. Navy to join the Confederate Navy. He {{was involved in the}} conversion of the frigate USS Merrimack into the ironclad CSS Virginia. He was also instrumental {{in the development of a}} new rifled gun for the Navy that became known as the Brooke rifle. [...] In 1862, he was promoted to commander, and in 1863, to Chief of the Confederate Navy's Bureau of Ordnance and <b>Hydrography,</b> until the end of the war. [...] He was instrumental in the organization and establishment of the Confederate States Naval Academy.|$|E
2500|$|The flag of Cidra {{features}} one brown vertical stripe on {{the left}} side, with a width of about one-third {{the length of the}} flag. It also features two equal-sized horizontal stripes to {{the right side of the}} brown one. The above stripe is green, while the lower one is yellow, or golden. The golden color symbolizes the richness of the fruits and its <b>hydrography,</b> as well as the spiritual wealth of the region. The green symbolizes the green landscape that can be seen in Cidra throughout the year, which is also the reason why the town is called the [...] "Town of the Eternal Spring". The brown symbolizes the Virgin, patron saint of the town, and also the Paloma sabanera that is widely seen in the area.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 1934, Swan and Parramatta {{were being}} towed down the Hawkesbury River for final {{breaking}} in Sydney, when gale conditions caused both hulls to break their tows. While Parramatta ran aground, Swan filled with rainwater and capsized at Tumbledown, near Croppy Point and Wobbly Beach. The exact {{location of the}} wreck was forgotten until 1994 When Greig Berry, a researcher/diver from the Central Coast claimed to have found it in 19 meters of water near Little Wobbie public wharf. He in turn was contacted by the DSTO and Berry showed them the site in 1996 and several sonar runs positively identified the remains as Swan. A RAN <b>hydrography</b> team came across the wreck while updating charts in 2001. Diving the wreck is not advised, as while Swan sits in only [...] of water, the currents in the area flow at around , and visibility is less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|The ship {{completed}} {{surveys in}} Hampton Roads, Virginia and transited to [...] in Georgia for surveys until going into Savannah, Georgia for repairs, 25 December 1919 through 8 March 1920. From Savannah she proceeded to the Neuse River, North Carolina area {{under the command}} of , later Rear Admiral and Assistant Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the vessel began surveys of the Neuse River and Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. She required emergency repairs and was in Elizabeth City, North Carolina from 1–16 July, returned to work and suffered a boiler casualty requiring tow into Oriental, North Carolina until 22 July. On resumption survey work included erection of shore signals, correcting the position of the Neuse River light, triangulation and charting the shoreline, tide and current measurements and <b>hydrography.</b> On 21 October 1920 the ship broke from surveys to Norfolk, Virginia where the ship was prepared for return to the Navy. On 23 November 1920 the ship transited to the Naval Operating Base, Hampton, Virginia for transfer on 26 November 1920.|$|E
2500|$|Drift {{was first}} sent out in June 1876 under Acting Master Robert Platt, USN, Assistant Coast Survey, to the Gulf of Maine to anchor in depths {{of up to}} 140 fathoms (840 feet/256 meters) to measure currents. The value of such {{measurements}} became immediately obvious as the Drift took advantage of her own observations in sailing and in a cited incident observed another ship struggling while she used currents effectively. During October–November the ship attempted further work but anchoring and effective measurements were obstructed by weather so the vessel returned to New York {{at the end of}} November. During this season, and subsequent work in the area the presence and location of tide rips was noted. There, while undertaking some hydrographic investigations in the entrance to New York harbor Drift was slightly damaged in a winter [...] "hurricane" [...] with temperature at 10°F (-12°C) during which she had to be towed away from the shore by two tugs. The report of the incident noted three other schooners and a steamboat were [...] "thrown on the beach by the hurricane." [...] After refit the Drift returned to the Gulf of Maine for current measurements. The schooner continued to occupy stations between Cape Sable and Nantucket observing currents and tide rips as well as incidental <b>hydrography.</b> Also noted as observed was [...] "what seemed to be a very large round spar projecting twelve to fifteen feet out of the sea" [...] that appeared on one side and then the other of the vessel while becalmed off Race Point, Cape Cod and [...] "near it an object having the form of an enormous dorsal fin" [...] that was observed with [...] "good glasses." [...] It was noted that none could say it was a creature, yet all on board agreed no [...] "floating wreck was anywhere in sight." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore, General Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States Engineers; Professor Henry Mitchell (the most {{competent}} authority {{on the question of}} <b>hydrography),</b> of the United States Coast Survey; B. B. Harrod, the State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas. B. Eads, whose success with the jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency, and Judge Taylor, of Indiana.|$|E
