2500|$|In {{the first}} year of the rat control program, [...] of arsenic {{trioxide}} were spread throughout 8,000 buildings on farms along the Saskatchewan border. However, in 1953 the much safer and more effective rodenticide, warfarin was introduced to replace arsenic. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that was approved as a drug for human use in 1954 and is much safer to use near humans and other large animals than arsenic. By 1960, the number of rat infestations in Alberta had dropped to below 200 per year. In 2002, the province finally recorded its first year with zero rat infestations, and from 2002 to 2007 there were only two infestations found. After an infestation of rats in the Medicine Hat landfill was found in 2012, the province's rat-free status was questioned, but provincial government rat control specialists brought in <b>excavating</b> <b>machinery,</b> dug out, shot, and poisoned 147 rats in the landfill, and no live rats were found thereafter. In 2013, the number of rat infestations in Alberta dropped to zero again. Alberta defines an infestation as two or more rats found at the same location, since a single rat cannot reproduce. About a dozen single rats enter Alberta in an average year and are killed by provincial rat control specialists before they can reproduce.|$|E
6000|$|The {{motto of}} the Little family was evidently [...] "variety." [...] Young Bingo {{is long and}} thin and hasn't had a {{superfluous}} ounce on him since we first met; but the uncle restored the average and a bit over.

60|$|We {{followed}} {{it as far}} as it went on our way to a modern work of peace and use which the ancient friend and servant of man would feel no unworthy rival. Beyond the drives and gardens of the Delicias, where we lingered our last to look at the pleasurers haunting them, we drove far across the wheat-fields where a ship-canal five miles long is cutting to rectify the curve of the Guadalquivir and bring Seville many miles nearer the sea than it has ever been before; hitherto the tramp steamers have had to follow the course of the ships of Tarshish in their winding approach. The canal is the notion of the young king of Spain, and the work on it goes forward night and day. The electric lights were shedding their blinding glare on the deafening clatter of the <b>excavating</b> <b>machinery,</b> and it was an unworthy relief to escape from the intense modernity of the scene to that medieval retreat nearer the city where the aficionados night-long watch the bulls coming up from their pastures for the fight or the feast, whichever you choose to call it, of the morrow. These amateurs, whom it would be rude to call sports, lurk in the wayside cafe over their cups of chocolate and wait till in that darkest hour before dawn, with irregular trampling and deep bellowing, these hapless heroes of the arena pass on to their doom. It is a great thing for the aficionados who may imagine in that bellowing the the gladiator's hail of Morituri salutant. At any rate, it is very chic; it gives a man standing in Seville, which disputes with Madrid the primacy in bull-feasting. If the national capital has bull-feasting every Sunday of the year, all the famous torreros come from Andalusia, with the bulls, their brave antagonists, and in the great provincial capital there are bull-feasts of insurpassable, if not incomparable, splendor.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of heavy}} <b>machinery</b> <b>excavating</b> {{the site of}} the City Garage in Pershing Square, Los Angeles, 1951. In the {{foreground}} at center, a steam shovel, a crane, and a bulldozer are all moving large amounts of dirt. The steam shovel is creating large piles of dirt at left, while the crane is helping to clear out a deep hole at right. The machines are working in a deep pit below the level of the surrounding streets. In the bottom of the pit at left, several cars can be seen, while a group of men is standing in a line at left near piles of construction materials. Two pickup trucks are visible in the foreground at left. Around the pit, several large buildings can be seen.; Legible signs include, from left: "Cafeteria", "A Truly Great Bourbon Cold Crow", "Santa Fe", and "Union Pacific"...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} amount of carbon and diffusible hydrogen, {{high-strength}} wear-resistant steel NM 360, which is widely used on <b>excavating</b> <b>machinery,</b> always tends to develop cold crack after welding. Heat affected zone (HAZ) is the weakest part in a welding joint and is the most probable location for the generation of welding cold crack. In this paper, the effects of preheating temperature and heat input on welding cold crack sensitivity of NM 360 steel have been studied by using implant tests. It is found that the preheating temperature and interlayer temperature during CO 2 arc welding of NM 360 steel should be 100 °C or 125 °C {{to prevent the occurrence}} of welding cold crack. The critical rupture stress and rupture time under high stress can be improved significantly with a high enough preheating temperature. However, heat input increase has little effect on critical rupture stress. Fracture analysis after performing implant test s indicates that the fracture in HAZ is typical hydrogen-induced cracking under high stress (≥ σcr). In addition, NM 360 steel in HAZ has an intercrystalline quasi-cleavage fracture mode. The area ratio of brittle fracture is increased by increasing test stress...|$|E
