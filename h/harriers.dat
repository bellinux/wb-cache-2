5|$|The Sea <b>Harriers</b> {{operated}} from INS Viraat for {{the last}} time on 6 March 2016. On 11 May 2016, a ceremony was held at INS Hansa, Dabolim, Goa to commemorate the phasing out of Sea <b>Harriers</b> from INAS 300 ("White Tigers"). Sea <b>Harriers</b> and MiG 29Ks performed an air display at the ceremony, marking the final flight of the Sea <b>Harriers</b> in the Indian Navy. INAS 300 subsequently introduced MiG 29K/Kub fighters to replace the retired Sea Harrier fleet.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's <b>harriers,</b> Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's <b>harriers</b> did not return, but marsh <b>harriers</b> did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Indian {{government}} {{approved of}} plans {{to acquire the}} Sea Harrier for the Indian Navy; prior to this, rumours reportedly were circulating of a potential Indian purchase of the Soviet V/STOL-capable Yak-36. The BAE Sea Hawk was phased out from the Indian Navy in 1978, {{in preparation for the}} purchase of Sea <b>Harriers.</b> In November 1979, India placed its first order for six Sea Harrier FRS Mk 51 fighters and two T Mk 60 Trainers; the first three Sea <b>Harriers</b> arrived at Dabolim Airport on 16 December 1983, and were inducted the same year. Ten more Sea <b>Harriers</b> were purchased in November 1985; eventually a total of 30 <b>Harriers</b> were procured, 25 for operational use and the remainder as dual-seat trainer aircraft. Until the 1990s, significant portions of pilot training was carried out in Britain due to limited aircraft availability.|$|E
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{two species}} were generally recognized: the marsh <b>harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus) and the African marsh <b>harrier</b> (C. ranivorus). The marsh <b>harrier</b> is now usually split into several species, sometimes {{as many as}} six. These are the western marsh <b>harrier</b> (C. aeruginosus), eastern marsh <b>harrier</b> (C. spilonotus), Papuan <b>harrier</b> (C. spilonotus spilothorax or C. spilothorax), swamp <b>harrier</b> (C. approximans), Réunion <b>harrier</b> (C. maillardi maillardi or C. maillardi) and Madagascar marsh <b>harrier</b> (C. maillardi macrosceles or C. macrosceles).|$|R

5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate <b>Harriers</b> from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of <b>Harriers</b> from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead <b>Harriers</b> are an {{athletic}} club based at Gateshead International Stadium. Founded in 1904 as Gateshead St Mary's Church Running Club, they were initially a men-only club until allowing {{the admission of}} women in 1951. The club moved to the Gateshead Youth Stadium in 1956, making the <b>Harriers</b> the stadium's oldest tenant. In 2006 they won promotion to the first division of the British Athletics League and were the only club from the north-east of England to compete at that level. After a six-year stay in the division, the <b>Harriers</b> were relegated to division two in August 2012 after failing to win enough points at the final meet of the season at Eton to prevent a bottom-two league finish. Club officials received over 100 new applications {{for membership in the}} aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Under the Joint Force <b>Harrier</b> organisation, {{both the}} RAF and RN {{operated}} the <b>Harrier</b> II, including routine operational deployments {{on board the}} navy's Invincible class aircraft carriers. The <b>Harrier</b> II participated in numerous conflicts, making significant contributions in combat theatres such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The type's main function was as a platform for air interdiction and close air support missions; the <b>Harrier</b> II was also used for presence projection and reconnaissance duties. The <b>Harrier</b> II served alongside the Sea <b>Harrier</b> in Joint Force <b>Harrier.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to Nalls, his Sea <b>Harrier</b> XZ439 is the world’s first {{privately owned}} and flown <b>Harrier</b> of any kind. In 2014, he {{acquired}} a two-seat <b>Harrier</b> {{that is the}} world’s only flyable civilian <b>Harrier</b> trainer aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The wood <b>harrier</b> {{was a small}} <b>harrier,</b> {{compared}} to the Recent species of the genus Circus. It had rather short wings but long legs and was even outsized by the small pied <b>harrier</b> and Montagu's <b>harrier.</b>|$|R
5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea <b>Harriers</b> {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the <b>Harriers</b> were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea <b>Harriers</b> were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, {{the initial}} batch of US-built {{aircraft}} arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training. The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year. In mid-January 1995, Giuseppe Garibaldi set off from Taranto to Somalia with three <b>Harriers</b> on board to maintain stability following {{the withdrawal of}} UN forces. The <b>Harriers,</b> flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the next}} {{generation}} AV-8Bs, nevertheless, the AV-8A/C <b>Harriers</b> suffered many accidents, with around 40 aircraft lost and some 30 pilots killed during '70 and '80s.|$|E

50|$|It {{resembles a}} small Eurasian marsh <b>harrier</b> but is slimmer and paler brown. Could {{be mistaken for}} an {{immature}} Montagu's <b>harrier</b> or pallid <b>harrier,</b> species which winter in Africa but the African marsh <b>harrier</b> can be readily distinguished from them by its lack of a white rump.|$|R
5|$|The Sea Harrier {{served in}} the Falklands War, and the Balkans conflicts; on all {{occasions}} it mainly operated from aircraft carriers positioned within the conflict zone. Its usage in the Falklands War was its most high profile and important success, where {{it was the only}} fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea <b>Harriers</b> shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict with two lost to enemy ground fire. They were also used to launch ground attacks {{in the same manner as}} the <b>Harriers</b> operated by the Royal Air Force.|$|E

50|$|<b>Harrier</b> Hawk I {{is based}} on Guizhou Central, another UAV {{designed}} by GAIC. <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I and Guizhou Central UAVs both share the identical conventional layout with low wing configuration, {{as well as the}} retractable tricycle land gear system. However, the fuelage of <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I is different than that of Guizhou Central in that instead of having an extremely smooth shuttle shaped fuselage of Guizhou Central, the fuselage of <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I is shaped in the form of turtle deck cokpit. Another distinction between Guizhou Central and <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I is that the winglets of <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I is much larger than that of Guizhou Central. Maiden flight of <b>Harrier</b> Hawk I was completed on March, 31, 2013.|$|R

5|$|All RAF GR.1s and {{the initial}} AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 {{inertial}} navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC <b>Harriers</b> by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer to aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new inertial navigation system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; {{at the same time}} several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain's <b>Harriers,</b> designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC <b>Harriers</b> differing only in the radios fitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Harrier</b> Comics (officially {{known as}} <b>Harrier</b> Publishing) was a British comic book {{publisher}} {{active in the}} mid-to-late 1980s. <b>Harrier</b> was notable for putting out black-and-white comics in a mold more similar to American comics than typical British fare.
