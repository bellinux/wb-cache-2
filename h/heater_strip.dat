40|$|It {{has been}} found that in the low-frequency regime, the {{experimentally}} determined thermal conductivity of thin dielectric films deviates significantly from the theoretical expectation based on Cahill's 3 omega thermal model. It is shown in the present work that this deviation is mainly caused by the heat transport in the <b>heater</b> <b>strip,</b> which is neglected in Cahill's one-dimensional model. By taking this mechanism into account, an analytical model is developed to simultaneously consider the heat transport in the <b>heater</b> <b>strip</b> and the heat flow into the underlying substrate. The validity of this two-dimensional model is confirmed by experiments using specially designed test structures as well as by numerical simulation. The results show that the heat transport along the <b>heater</b> <b>strip,</b> originated from a nonuniform temperature, becomes comparable to that in the substrate at low frequencies. This effect of a nonuniform temperature distribution can also be exploited for extraction of the thermal conductivity of the metallic strip itself...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed for investigating boundary layer transition control for a three-dimensional flat plate boundary layer. Control of a periodically forced boundary layer in an incompressible fluid is studied using surface heating techniques. The spatially evolving boundary layer is simulated. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations are integrated using a fully implicit finite difference/spectral method. The Navier-Stokes equations are in vorticity-velocity form and are coupled with the energy equation through the viscosity dependence on temperature. Both passive and active methods of control by surface heating are investigated. In passive methods of control, wall heating is employed to alter the stability characteristics of the mean flow. Both uniform and nonuniform surface temperature distributions are studied. In the active control investigations, temperature perturbations are introduced locally along finite <b>heater</b> <b>strips</b> to directly attenuate the instability waves in the flow. A feedback control loop is employed in which a downstream sensor is used to monitor wall shear stress fluctuations. Passive control of small amplitude two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting waves and three-dimensional oblique waves are numerically simulated with both uniform and nonuniform passive heating applied. Strong reductions in both amplitude levels and amplification rates are achieved. Active control of small amplitude two-dimensional and three-dimensional disturbances is also numerically simulated. With proper phase control, in phase reinforcement and out of phase attenuation is demonstrated. A receptivity study is performed to study how localized temperature perturbations are generated into Tollmien-Schlichting waves. It is shown that narrow <b>heater</b> <b>strips</b> are more receptive in that they maximize the amplitude level of the disturbances in the flow.

40|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} properties of several {{different kinds of}} YBCO insulations and the quench properties of pancake coils made using these insulations were studied. Insulations investigated include Nomex, Kapton, and Mylar, as well as insulations based on ZnO, Zn 2 GeO 4, and ZnO-Cu. Initially, short stacks of YBCO conductors with interlayer insulation, epoxy, and a central <b>heater</b> <b>strip</b> were made and later measured for thermal conductivity in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, three different pancake coils were made. The first two were smaller, each using one meter total of YBCO tape present as four turns around a G- 10 former. One of these smaller coils used Mylar insulation co-wound with the YBCO tape, the other used YBCO tape onto which ZnO based insulation had been deposited. One larger coil was made which used 12 total meters of ZnO-insulated tape and had 45 turns. The results for all short sample and coil thermal conductivities were ~ 1 - 3 Wm- 1 K- 1. Finally, quench propagation velocity measurements were performed on the coils (77 K, self field) by applying a DC current and then using a heater pulse to initiate a quench. Normal zone propagation velocity (NZP) values were obtained for the coils both in the radial direction and in the azimuthal direction. Radial NZP values (0. 05 - 0. 7 mm/s) were two orders of magnitude lower than axial values (~ 14 - 17 mm/s).

40|$|The {{control of}} the {{transition}} from laminar to turbulent flow in a boundary layer of a flat plate is investigated using numerical simulations. The numerical model {{is based on the}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is coupled with the energy equation through the temperature dependent viscosity. A fully implicit finite difference spectral method was used to solve the governing equations. The numerical model allows for the spatial evolution of the disturbances in a non-parallel boundary layer. Active control of wave packet disturbances in the non-isothermal boundary layer is studied in detail. Wave packet disturbances are created in the flow field by simulating the effect of thermally activated heater elements on the plate surface. Through a controlled spanwise variation of the temperature of the heater elements, two- and three-dimensional wave packet disturbances can be studied. The propagation and amplification of the wave packet disturbances in the boundary layer is examined. The heater elements on the plate surface act as locally strong heat sources causing thermal wakes within the boundary layer that spread in the downstream direction. A transfer function technique is used for the control strategy. The transfer function is based on the vorticity response to a finite temperature fluctuation at the <b>heater</b> <b>strip</b> and is obtained from the numerical simulations. With additional heater segments (controller) located downstream of an excitation source, the possibility of attenuating wave packet disturbances is investigated. With the numerical transfer function, a successful control strategy for the wave packet cancellation could be developed. Initially, for the low amplitude, two-dimensional disturbances in the transition process with the implemented control strategy the wave packet disturbances could be almost completely cancelled. For the attentuation of three-dimensional wave packet disturbances, the transfer function technique was extended to allow for spanwise variations. The attenuation of three-dimensional wave packets with the modified transfer function technique was almost equally as successful as for the purely two-dimensional flow disturbances. For the simulation of the three-dimensional flow development with no control applied, nonlinear interaction of wave components of the wave packet first appeared for the oblique modes in the low frequency range, which was also observed in experimental investigations. The attenuation of only the two-dimensional components of a three-dimensional wave packet disturbance delays the onset of the nonlinear interaction of the oblique spanwise modes in the lower frequency range...|$|E
