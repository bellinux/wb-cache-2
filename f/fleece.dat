40|$|Temperature loggers were {{implanted}} to record core body temperature (Tcore) and rumen temperature (Trumen) in sheep. The relationship between Tcore and Trumen was compared for <b>fleeced</b> and shorn Merino sheep over {{a range of}} environmental temperatures and during stressors involved with shearing. <b>Fleeced</b> sheep maintained higher Tcore and Trumen than shorn sheep in all environmental conditions tested (from thermoneutral up to 33 °C and 55 % relative humidity). Shearing of the <b>fleeced</b> sheep resulted in those sheep having a lower Tcore when exposed to hot conditions, compared to the previously shorn sheep. Respiratory rates of <b>fleeced</b> sheep followed similar patterns and were higher than shorn sheep under all environmental conditions. After the <b>fleeced</b> sheep were shorn, their respiratory rates decreased to rates similar to the previously shorn sheep when under heat load, suggesting heat loss other than respiratory evaporative heat loss was augmented...|$|R

5|$|The relics Poseidon's Trident, the Golden <b>Fleece,</b> and Icarus' Wings {{acquired}} in previous games are retained {{and used to}} overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden <b>Fleece</b> also used to deflect enemy attacks. Kratos acquires a new relic, Hades' Soul, which allows him to safely swim in the River Styx. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in God of War II, is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.|$|E
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose <b>fleece</b> became the Golden <b>Fleece</b> of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Aries was {{not fully}} {{accepted}} as a constellation until classical times. In Hellenistic astrology, the constellation of Aries {{is associated with the}} golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos and Helle on orders from Hermes, taking Phrixos to the land of Colchis. Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King Athamas and his first wife Nephele. The king's second wife, Ino, was jealous and wished to kill his children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in Boeotia, then falsified a message from the Oracle of Delphi that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop Mount Laphystium when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived. Helle fell off of Aries's back in flight and drowned in the Dardanelles, also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the <b>Fleece</b> to Aeëtes of Colchis, who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter Chalciope. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the Golden <b>Fleece</b> and was guarded by a dragon. In a later myth, this Golden <b>Fleece</b> was stolen by Jason and the Argonauts.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{shearing}} at the farm, woollen <b>fleeces</b> {{are placed}} together in [...] "sheets", {{that is to}} say large sacks containing about 20 rolled <b>fleeces</b> each. These sheets are bulky yet are light (weighing about 60 kg) and convenient for the small famer to transport to his local wool collection centre. Here they are opened for grading and sorting into one of several dozen different qualities, based on breed of sheep, which dictates fineness of wool, and physical condition of the wool, for example damp dirty or stained <b>fleeces</b> will be graded lowly.|$|R
40|$|Background The in vivo {{pharmacokinetics}} of gentamycin- loaded collagen <b>fleeces</b> {{in humans}} {{have not been}} described in the current literature. We therefore analyzed in vivo pharmacokinetics of these <b>fleeces</b> when used {{in the treatment of}} periprosthetic infections. Patients and methods Gentamycin concentrations were measured in 19 consecutive patients with an acute periprosthetic infection. Each patient received 2 - 5 <b>fleeces</b> (130 mg gentamycin/fleece). Results Initially, the blood concentration increased to 3. 2 - 7. 2 mg/L, depending on the number of <b>fleeces</b> that were applied. The serum peak concentrations resulted in peak/MIC ratios of 2. 5 - 36 for P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Klebsiella spp. Subsequently, the serum values decreased almost linearly below 0. 3 mg/L in 18 to 62 hours. After 24 hours, the serum levels of gentamicin dropped below 2 mg/L, the toxicity threshold. Interpretation The application of 2 to 5 130 -mg gentamycin-loaded collagen <b>fleeces</b> may be useful as an adjuvant treatment for implant-related infections, since no toxic concentrations were measured 24 hours postoperatively...|$|R

5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda triangle), the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, they pass the island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, hubris, to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the <b>fleece.</b> Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood with the <b>Fleece.</b> The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back to the Fields of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden <b>Fleece</b> heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden <b>Fleece</b> also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days the sheep were not shorn, but the wool was {{collected}} when the sheep moulted in the summer, either by plucking it from their <b>fleece</b> or collecting it {{where it had been}} rubbed off on a tree or rock.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden <b>Fleece,</b> and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that can not be achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden <b>Fleece</b> deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their <b>fleece</b> is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, <b>fleece</b> averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their <b>fleece</b> can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|Wool {{processing}} includes {{removing the}} <b>fleece</b> by shearing, classing the wool by quality, untangling, carding and spinning it into yarn, {{which may be}} knitted or woven into cloth, then finishing the cloth by fulling, napping and pressing.|$|E

Tantalus (who replaced Chiron as camp counselor) sends Clarisse La Rue on a quest to find the Golden <b>Fleece.</b> Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson run away from camp to find Grover. They are aided in their escape by the god Hermes, who helps them reach a passing cruise ship, the Princess Andromeda. Once aboard, they discover that the ship is full of tourists in a dream-like state living alongside Greek monsters. They are captured by Luke Castellan and learn that he is trying to revive his master Kronos. They escape on a lifeboat and eventually find one of many hideouts that Luke, Thalia, and Annabeth built as children. They are attacked by a hydra but are saved by Clarisse, who is sailing on a confederate ironclad called the CSS Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and <b>fleece</b> yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} many venues for live music, its largest the 2,000-seat Colston Hall named after Edward Colston. Others include the Bristol Academy, The <b>Fleece,</b> The Croft, the Exchange, Fiddlers, the Victoria Rooms, Trinity Centre, St George's Bristol and several pubs, from the jazz-oriented The Old Duke to rock at the <b>Fleece</b> and indie bands at the Louisiana. In 2010 PRS for Music called Bristol the UK's most musical city, {{based on the}} number of its members born there {{relative}} to the city's population. Since the late 1970s Bristol has been home to bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, and trip hop and Bristol Sound artists such as Tricky, Portishead and Massive Attack; the list of bands from Bristol is extensive. The city is a stronghold of drum and bass, with artists such as Roni Size's Mercury Prize-winning Reprazent, as DJ Krust, More Rockers and TC. Trip hop and drum & bass music, in particular, is part of the Bristol urban-culture scene which received international media attention during the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{polyester}} urethane Degrapol® (DP) was explored for medical applications. Electrospun DP-fiber <b>fleeces</b> were characterized {{with regard to}} fiber morphology, swelling, and interconnectivity of interfiber spaces. Moreover, DP was assayed for cell proliferation and hemocompatibility being a prerequisite to any further in vivo application. It was shown that DP-fiber <b>fleeces</b> produced at different humidity while spinning affects interconnectivity of interfiber spaces, such that the higher the humidity the looser the resulting fiber <b>fleeces.</b> When the spinning target was cooled with dry ice, the resulting DP-fibers remained less fused to each other. However, permeability for fluorescent beads was not significantly increased. Fibroblast adhesion and proliferation occurred in a comparable manner on native {{as well as on}} fibronectin or collagen I adsorbed DP-fiber <b>fleeces.</b> On DP-surfaces fibroblasts proliferated equally well as compared with glass or PLGA surfaces or DP-surfaces adsorbed with fibronectin or collagen I. In contrast, human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferated only after adsorption of DP-surfaces with fibronectin or collagen I, indicating that different cell types respond differently to DP-surfaces. Furthermore, hemocompatibility of DP-surfaces was found to be similar or better to PLGA or stainless steel, both medically used materials. These experiments indicate that DP-fiber <b>fleeces</b> or surfaces might be useful for tissue engineering...|$|R
