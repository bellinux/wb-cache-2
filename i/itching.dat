40|$|<b>Itch</b> is an {{unpleasant}} cutaneous sensation that can arise following insect bites, exposure to plant ingredients, and some diseases. <b>Itch</b> {{can also have}} idiopathic causes. <b>Itch</b> sensations are thought to protect against external insults and toxic substances.

Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for chronic <b>itch</b> require careful investigation. There is {{a significant amount of}} basic research concerning <b>itch,</b> and the effect of various <b>itch</b> mediators on primary sensory neurons have been studied. Interestingly, many mediators of <b>itch</b> involve signaling related to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRP channels, especially thermosensitive TRP channels, are expressed by primary sensory neurons and skin keratinocytes, which receive multimodal stimuli, including those that cause <b>itch</b> sensations. Here we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms of <b>itch</b> and the involvement of TRP channels in mediating <b>itch</b> sensations...|$|R
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an <b>itching</b> sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen <b>itching</b> spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|<b>Itch</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{complications}} of skin diseases. Although there are various substances that induce <b>itch</b> or pruritus, it is evident that histamine is the best known endogenous agent that evokes <b>itch.</b> Even though histamine-induced <b>itch</b> has been studied for some time, the underlying mechanism of <b>itch</b> is just beginning to emerge. Although various downstream signaling pathways of histamine receptors have been revealed, more studies are required to determine the cause of histamine-induced <b>itch.</b> It appears that <b>itch</b> and pain involve different neuronal pathways. Pain generally inhibits <b>itch,</b> which indicates an inter-communication between the two. Complex interactions between <b>itch</b> and pain may be expected based on reports on disease states and opioids. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism and the pharmacological aspects of histamine-induced <b>itch.</b> Especially, the underlying mechanism of TRPV 1 (an anti-pruritus target) has been determined to some extent...|$|R

5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic.

Workers exposed to cerium have experienced <b>itching,</b> sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, <b>itching,</b> local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called millipede burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E

Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or <b>itching,</b> and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
40|$|Histamine is the prototypical pruritogen used in {{experimental}} <b>itch</b> induction. However, in most chronic pruritic diseases, <b>itch</b> is not predominantly mediated by histamine.

We tested the validity of cowhage as an itch-inducing agent by contrasting it with the classical <b>itch</b> inducer, histamine, in healthy subjects and atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. We also investigated {{whether there was a}} cumulative effect when both agents were combined. Fifteen healthy individuals and fifteen AD patients were recruited. Experimental <b>itch</b> induction was performed in eczema-free areas on the volar aspects of the forearm, using different <b>itch</b> inducers: histamine, cowhage and their combination thereof. <b>Itch</b> intensity was assessed continuously for 5. 5 minutes after stimulus application using a computer-assisted visual analogue scale (COVAS). In both healthy and AD subjects, the mean and peak intensity of <b>itch</b> were higher after the application of cowhage compared to histamine, and were higher after the combined application of cowhage and histamine, compared to histamine alone (p< 0. 0001 in all cases). <b>Itch</b> intensity ratings were not significantly different between healthy and AD subjects for the same <b>itch</b> inducer used; however AD subjects exhibited a prolonged <b>itch</b> response in comparison to healthy subjects (p< 0. 001). Cowhage induced a more intense <b>itch</b> sensation compared to histamine. Cowhage was the dominant factor in <b>itch</b> perception when both pathways were stimulated in the same time.

In the present study, verbally induced nocebo and placebo effects on <b>itch</b> were experimentally investigated {{for the first}} time. In part 1, the role of verbal suggestions in inducing nocebo effects on <b>itch</b> and pain was investigated. All subjects received the same somatosensory quantitative sensory testing stimuli, that is, mechanical and electrical stimuli and application of histamine, and verbal suggestions to manipulate expectations regarding the stimuli. The suggestions were designed to produce either high expectations for <b>itch</b> (<b>itch</b> nocebo) or pain (pain nocebo) or low expectations for <b>itch</b> (<b>itch</b> nocebo control) or pain (pain nocebo control). Results showed that high <b>itch</b> and pain expectations resulted in higher levels of <b>itch</b> and pain, respectively. When comparing nocebo effects, induced by verbal suggestions, results were more pronounced for <b>itch</b> than for pain. In part 2, verbal suggestions designed to produce a placebo effect on <b>itch</b> (<b>itch</b> placebo) or pain (pain placebo), or neutral suggestions (<b>itch</b> placebo control and pain placebo control) were given regarding a second application of histamine and compared with the first application applied in part 1. Results of placebo effects only showed a significantly larger decrease in <b>itch</b> in the <b>itch</b> placebo condition than in the pain placebo condition. In conclusion, we showed {{for the first time}} that nocebo and possibly placebo responses can be induced on <b>itch</b> by verbal suggestions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Itch</b> {{is defined}} as an {{unpleasant}} sensation that evokes a desire to scratch. In contrast to acute <b>itch</b> that is transient, chronic <b>itch</b> is a persistent, debilitating condition for which there are few treatment options. Chronic <b>itch</b> accompanies a number of skin diseases and systemic conditions, {{as well as a}} variety of neurological disorders. However, {{little is known about the}} molecules and cell types that mediate acute or chronic <b>itch</b> in primary sensory neurons and skin. We have established an essential role for the ion channel, TRPA 1, in multiple forms of both acute and chronic <b>itch.</b> We have shown that TRPA 1 is required for neuronal activation and <b>itch</b> behaviors in mice downstream of acute exogenous and endogenous <b>itch</b> compounds. Similarly, TRPA 1 is required for <b>itch</b> behavior and itch-evoked expressional changes in both sensory neurons and skin in a mouse model of dry skin. We have also identified a novel itch-causing compound: Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP). Numerous studies suggest that the epithelially-derived cytokine TSLP acts as a master switch that triggers both the initiation and maintenance of the chronic <b>itch</b> disease atopic dermatitis. Our work demonstrates that TSLP activates sensory neurons directly and leads to acute <b>itch</b> behaviors. TRPA 1 is required for both TSLP-evoked neuronal activation and <b>itch</b> behaviors. Taken together, our work shows that TRPA 1 is a master regulator of <b>itch</b> signaling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Itch</b> {{and pain}} are two {{distinct}} sensory modalities elicited by noxious and pruritic stimuli, respectively. The cellular and electrophysiological characteristics of <b>itch</b> and pain are very similar; thus discerning the mechanical {{difference between these}} two sensory modalities has long been elusive. Recent advances in this field have revealed various neuronal receptors responsible for <b>itch</b> and pain signal transduction and transmission. These studies have identified a distinct sub-population of sensory neurons responsible for <b>itch</b> signal transduction. In addition, <b>itch</b> and pain information conveyed to the spinal cord are processed and regulated by distinct spinal cord neurons. Although both <b>itch</b> and pain senses are required for our daily lives, chronic and hyper-sensation of <b>itch</b> and pain results in a debilitating disease state. Studies have now begun to elucidate mechanisms for the sensitization of pain and <b>itch</b> and also to unravel counter-regulatory mechanisms between <b>itch</b> and pain at the spinal cord level. Interestingly, toll-like receptors (TLRs), an innate immune receptor, has been implicated in the central sensitization of both pain and <b>itch.</b> In this review, we will briefly provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms of <b>itch</b> and pain. Additionally, we will discuss the recently uncovered role of TLRs in <b>itch</b> and pain sensation...|$|R

5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve <b>itching</b> and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, <b>itching,</b> or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized <b>itching,</b> fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} patients with burn injury develop chronic <b>itch,</b> which can severely affect their quality of life.

2500|$|The {{location}} of the reference point for each individual that experiences referred <b>itch</b> is well conserved and specific to each person, in that a certain location will elicit the phenomenon repeatedly for a given person while <b>itches</b> elsewhere may not.

40|$|SummaryThe natural {{response}} to <b>itch</b> sensation is to scratch, which relieves the <b>itch</b> through an unknown mechanism. Interaction between pain and <b>itch</b> has been frequently demonstrated, and the selectivity hypothesis of <b>itch,</b> {{based on data}} from electrophysiological and behavioral experiments, postulates the existence of primary pain afferents capable of repressing <b>itch.</b> Here, we demonstrate that deletion of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 2 in a subpopulation of neurons partly overlapping with the vanilloid receptor (TRPV 1) primary afferents resulted in a dramatic increase in <b>itch</b> behavior accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to thermal pain. The increased <b>itch</b> behavior was reduced by administration of antihistaminergic drugs and by genetic deletion of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, demonstrating a dependence on VGLUT 2 to maintain normal levels of both histaminergic and nonhistaminergic <b>itch.</b> This study establishes that VGLUT 2 is a major player in TRPV 1 thermal nociception and also serves to regulate a normal <b>itch</b> response...|$|R

It may be accompanied by severe <b>itching,</b> swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the <b>itch</b> pathway {{has also}} been linked with WDR neurons because <b>itch</b> and pain {{pathways}} are closely associated.
