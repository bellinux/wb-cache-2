50|$|In a slingatron, {{projectiles}} are accelerated along a {{rigid tube}} or track that typically has circular or spiral turns, or combinations of these geometries {{in two or}} three dimensions. A projectile is accelerated in the curved tube by propelling the entire tube in a small-amplitude circular motion of constant or increasing frequency without changing the orientation of the tube, i.e. the entire tube gyrates but does not spin.
