40|$|Introduction There {{has been}} a {{controversy}} in this journal about using downside risk measures in portfolio analysis. The downside risk measures supposedly are a major improvement over traditional portfolio theory. That is where the battle lines clashed when Rom and Ferguson (1993, 1994 b) and Kaplan and Siegel (1994 a, 1994 b) engaged in a "tempest in a teapot".

Therefore, you should <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> bias <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> as you read this article. One of the best means to understand a concept is to study the history of its development.

Board of Education, (Kozol, 2005, Mullins, 2013; Rothstein, 2013; Strauss, 2014; UCLA, 2014). Coinciding with this segregation are vast racial inequities and stratification, which are being intensified through the policies known as corporate education reform. In this article, we share the voices and stories of scholars and education activists who have documented the racism and segregation of U. S. public schooling over the rise of corporate education reform. We start with the current state of our segregated schools, what Jonathan Kozol refers to as “apartheid education” (Kozol, 2005). We then take a step {{back and look at the}} historical and ideological context of U. S. schooling under industrial capitalism, white supremacy and neoliberalism, all creating the perfect storm for the punitive and dehumanizing conditions within 21 st century public education. We will then explore the formula of corporate education reform through an examination of specific instruments used to enact these policies: school choice and charters, high-stakes testing, and the disciplining and criminalizing of black and brown bodies. We also examine the delivery of these policies via the discourse used to justify them and the intentions behind them. Finally, we call the question of whether {{public schools are}} our best hope for achieving social and economic equity and how those working in this struggle might <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> vision <b>in</b> <b>mind...</b>|$|R

Since the most creative and generally read literary form in the law is the appellate judicial opinion, we will concentrate on that form for purposes of demonstration. Indeed, a literary treatment of the appellate opinion may prove doubly useful. Judicial writing is often so wrapped in legal paraphernalia as to seem an hermetically sealed and therefore mysterious genre to the general reader. Our ultimate goal, then, is to identify and clarify the appellate judicial opinion as a distinct literary genre within the larger civic literature of the American republic of laws...|$|R

This kind of talent for project management has been surrounded by a fair degree of mythology, but is rarely discussed in any real sense. Being a form of fingerspitzengefühl, the ability to react to unforeseen and non-standard situations is a nec-essary skill for a project manager, due to the unique nature of project work. Gustafsson (1997) even argues that this kind of feeling for management is definitional for han-dling any form of organization. Taking this non-analytic knowledge seriously is crucial if we are to improve our theories about temporary organizing. Rather than try to fit it to a certain model, however, we should approach it through an analysis <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the in-tangible nature of such a skill.

Furthermore, during rote rehearsal, the extent of neural activation in regions associated with semantic retrieval was assessed to determine the role that incidental semantic elaboration may play in subsequent memory for rote-rehearsed items. Results revealed that (a) the magnitude of activation in neural regions previously associated with phonological rehearsal (left prefrontal, bilateral parietal, supplementary motor, and cerebellar regions) was correlated with subsequent memory, and (b) while rote rehearsal did not [...] -on average [...] -elicit activation in an anterior left prefrontal region associated with semantic retrieval, activation in this region was greater for trials that were subsequently better remembered.
