500|$|Once Vig {{learned about}} the analog project, at first he {{considered}} Grohl was joking, but then replied that [...] "You <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play really well, because nothing is gonna be fixed" [...] since mistakes are not as easily correctable as in a digital recording. With that in mind, the band spent three weeks doing pre-production and rehearsals at Studio 606, where the composition was completed, going [...] "from forty songs to fourteen", and said songs were rehearsed to be recorded live, while in previous records, as put by Mendel, [...] "we'd often come up with parts in the studio, and the songs would evolve". Smear added that the band committed to not change what would end recorded: [...] "Whatever we did, we didn’t change it. If a distorted vocal went through a pedal, that’s what {{it was going to}} be.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
5000|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was {{planned to be}} released, however, Derulo has confirmed that was made: [...] "It's in the concept; the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be really strong. You will understand when you actually see video. It's a competition of some sort." ...|$|E

5000|$|At that time, then-commissioner Fay Vincent {{told the}} owners: [...] The single biggest reality you <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{face up to}} is collusion. You stole $280 million from the players, and the players are unified to a man around that issue, because you got caught and {{many of you are}} still involved.|$|E
50|$|These {{insulators}} {{also have}} to be equipped with overvoltage protection equipment. For the dimensions of the guy insulation, static charges on <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considered. At high masts these can be much higher than the voltage caused by the transmitter, requiring guys divided by insulators in multiple sections on the highest masts. In this case, guys which are grounded at the anchor basements via a coil - or if possible, directly - are the better choice.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} ultras of Rome leaves to Turin, where the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{play the game}} of Juve-Roma. The Romans are greeted with stones by enemies, {{and the leader of}} the extremist group: Er Prince, orders his {{followers}} to stab the fans of Juventus. The two opposing factions are arrested and are forced to tell the facts to the superintendent. Meanwhile, in the stadium of Juventus, the remaining ultras are locked in a brawl between their enemies with exaggerated stabbings and stones.|$|E

5000|$|She has stated, [...] "In {{those early}} days, I wouldn't {{turn around to}} face the audience. But nobody forced me and I slowly turned around and I slowly {{opened my eyes and}} I slowly began to say hello. And now they can't shut me up! I see Mike looking at me as I tell a story that has no {{relevance}} whatsoever and I lose track. [...] Now, the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start playing songs because my on-stage monologues go on so long." ...|$|E
5000|$|Don't Let Go: A swing is {{suspended}} 360 {{feet in a}} canyon over the Shotover River. Players are teamed up into male/female pairs, with the girls harnessed from a swing and their male partners harnessed from a platform hanging {{from the edge of}} a cliff. Once the swing mechanisms are released, the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hang on to their female partners with their hands for as long as possible, before the girls are eventually swung 200 feet downward {{in the form of a}} bungee jumping contest. The team that hangs on for the longest time wins.|$|E
50|$|Eleven couples remain. Would-be {{blushing}} brides turn ugly {{as their}} claws come {{out when they}} try to snatch up the most wedding bouquets in a gift challenge. Winner gets a $5,000 flower prize package. Losers get bruises and tears. All the women learn Stephanie is {{a force to be reckoned}} with. At the security challenge, the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold their fiancées above a makeshift threshold. Last one to drop their lady in the ocean wins security for him and his fiancée. It's battle of endurance, emotion, and back pain. At the chapel ceremony, the vote count catches one couple by surprise and they're sent home without their dream wedding.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} they stood {{talking in a}} little group by the bench, Colonel Kelmscott {{meanwhile}} thawing by degrees and growing gradually interested in what <b>Guy</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, while Elma looked on with a devouring curiosity.|$|R
5000|$|The title {{refers to}} the tower where princess Etruria [...] "gets captured" [...] and the <b>guy</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> save her. Apparently the whole story {{involves}} the princess Etruria because she is really clumsy and {{makes a lot of}} mistakes.|$|R
60|$|Maître Leroux came in {{shortly after}} Jules Varoy had left. He had not, until {{the man told}} him, heard {{of the events of}} the night before, and <b>Guy</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell him all about it before {{anything}} else was said.|$|R
50|$|Lee and Angel's {{coworkers}} at Coreco are Kristin, a clingy {{divorced mother}} who instantly took a shine to Lee; Kelly, who {{is far more}} apt to cavort with men and indulge in drink than to do her job; Grace, the condescending regional sales leader; and Vanessa, the boss, whom the workers wrongly assume is a lesbian, and whom Angel immediately becomes enamored with. In addition to the women at work, the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hide their secret identities from Lee's wife Connie, a nurse {{who works in a}} doctor's office; his teenaged daughter Kat; and Connie's brother Brian, who was laid off at the Pontiac factory along with Lee and Angel and now resides in his ex-wife's home.|$|E
5000|$|Todd Lyons, {{giving the}} EP four stars for About.com, states, [...] "With all their flashes of interesting, solid musicianship {{especially}} from Taylor Pool’s keyboard fills, the EP wrestles itself above a raggedy demo presentation, but threatens to cave {{in under the}} weight of its overtly obvious message." [...] Rating the EP three and a half stars at Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies says, [...] "This is most definitely a real metal fans, metal EP!" [...] Brody B., awarding the EP four stars from Indie Vision Music, writes, [...] "While the disk has a few minor flaws, it still keeps me optimistic about what these <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> offer as they continue to grow." ...|$|E
5000|$|Schwartz {{has stated}} that he set the series at an {{electronics}} store to compliment Chuck: I think the big-box culture {{is very much a}} way that we live our lives right now. And in {{trying to figure out what}} was sort of the best home for a character like Chuck, the Nerd Herd -- obviously inspired by such things as the Geek Squad the consumer electronics -- felt like a really natural environment for him. I also liked that even in the uniforms that the Nerd Herd <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear, they kind of resemble G-men from 1950s FBI movies. So there's a lot of components, both visually and in terms of his character, that were really appealing about setting it there.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the group's {{reputation}} for womanizing and heavy drinking, Joey Bishop stated in a 1998 interview: [...] "I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances.

5000|$|A dappled gray, Evening Attire was gelded {{because one}} of his {{testicles}} was immature and stuck in the canal.

[...] As a gelding, Evening Attire raced {{until the age of}} ten. Out of the successful Mr. Prospector line, he raced well off the pace, often closing dramatically.|$|R

5000|$|A {{search warrant}} was {{executed}} on June 1, 2017 for Hamilton High School's emails and other documents. After {{review of the}} evidence showed the hazing issue was systemic. The school staff learned of the hazing long before their police statements. Charges were recommended for Steve Belles, Athletic Director Shawn Rustad, and newly appointed Principal Ken James, for failing to report child abuse. Leaked documents stated Belles {{had a meeting with}} the full football program where he allegedly said, [...] "You <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop raping each other." [...] Manny Palomarez, former varsity defensive coordinator, disputably reported, [...] "they were pooking each other in the butt". All three were allowed to continue working until the Maricopa District Attorney decides to charge any of them. Principal Ken James also made a statement implicating Chandler Unified School District Superintendent Camille Castile by not monitoring athletic staff closer, without any concrete references of negligence.|$|E
50|$|Wrap and Roll: A 50-foot {{platform}} is suspended 1,000 {{feet above the}} ground. Played in male/female pairs, the girls from each team have to advance {{from one of the}} platform to the middle, where their male partner will be standing. A 20-foot rope is attached to each partner, and the girls have to wrap themselves in the rope in order to advance toward their male partner, then the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> twirl around {{to the other end of}} the platform, and the process will repeat until each partner has advanced to the opposite end. Players are disqualified if they touch the rope with their hands, their rope makes contact with the platform or they exceed a 10-minute time limit. The team that completes the challenge in the fastest average time wins. Note: Since the Bad Asses team was short one male player, Derrick had to compete twice.|$|E

50|$|All {{the tents}} listed here had a canvas fabric and most used a {{substantial}} number of guy ropes (8 <b>to</b> 18). The <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be positioned and tensioned fairly precisely in order to pitch the tent correctly, so some training and experience were needed. Pup tents might use wooden or metal poles, but all the other styles mentioned here used wooden poles.|$|R

He loved to agitate, and it was not right." [...] According to Rod Carew, [...] "He was always negative about everything in the locker room. I finally got tired of it one night...we were having a team meeting and he was constantly interrupting people. I said to him, 'Just shut up and listen to what the <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say.' He asked what I was going to do about it, so I challenged him to a fight.
