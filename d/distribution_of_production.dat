50|$|Douglas’s first book, Economic Democracy, was {{published}} in 1920, soon after his article The Delusion of Super-Production appeared in 1918 in the English Review. Among Douglas’s other early works were The Control and <b>Distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production,</b> Credit-Power and Democracy, Warning Democracy and The Monopoly of Credit. Of considerable interest is the evidence he presented to the Canadian House of Commons Select Committee on Banking and Commerce in 1923, to the British Parliamentary Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930, which included exchanges with economist John Maynard Keynes, and to the Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature in 1934 during the term of the United Farmers of Alberta Government in that Canadian province.|$|E

5000|$|Douglas {{believed}} that money {{should not be}} regarded as a commodity but rather as a ticket, a means of <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> [...] "There are two sides to this question of a ticket representing something that we can call, if we like, a value. There is the ticket itself - the money which forms the thing we call 'effective demand' - and there is something we call a price opposite to it." [...] Money is effective demand, and the means of reclaiming that money are prices and taxes. As real capital replaces labour in the process of modernization, money should become increasingly an instrument of distribution. The idea that money is a medium of exchange is related to the belief that all wealth is created by the current labour of the world, and Douglas clearly rejected this belief, stating that the cultural inheritance of society is the primary factor in the creation of wealth, which makes money a distribution mechanism, not a medium of exchange.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} that, {{in addition}} to its current scope, the Fund should be able to support workers made redundant {{as a result of the}} global financial and economic crisis on 16 December 2008. In addition, it proposes to reduce the threshold of redundancies from the current 1,000 to 500, to extend the period of each case from 12 months to 24 months, and to increase its contribution from 50% of total cost to 75% (the rest being contributed by the member state). This proposal was submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in December 2008. It is expected that the amendment will be adopted in mid-2009. There is a need of this fund because the difference in labour costs at the international level remains an important determinant of the geographical <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> because the large apparel companies are constantly seeking production bases lower labour costs. Additionally, the ongoing globalisation of trade has intensified this situation. The search for lower labour costs have led to significant changes in the image of global apparel industry. The production of clothing gradually moved from Europe to Asia, which now accounts for nearly 45% of global garment production.|$|E
5000|$|Douglas {{disagreed}} with classical economists who recognised only three factors of production: land, labour and capital. While Douglas {{did not deny}} the role of these factors in production, he considered the “cultural inheritance of society” as the primary factor. He defined cultural inheritance as the knowledge, techniques and processes that have accrued to us incrementally from the origins of civilization (i.e. progress). Consequently, mankind {{does not have to}} keep [...] "reinventing the wheel". [...] "We are merely the administrators of that cultural inheritance, and to that extent the cultural inheritance is the property of all of us, without exception. Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx claimed that labour creates all value. While Douglas did not deny that all costs ultimately relate to labour charges of some sort (past or present), he denied that the present labour of the world creates all wealth. Douglas carefully distinguished between value, costs and prices. He claimed that one of the factors resulting in a misdirection of thought in terms of the nature and function of money was economists' near-obsession about values and their relation to prices and incomes. While Douglas recognized [...] "value in use" [...] as a legitimate theory of values, he also considered values as subjective and not capable of being measured in an objective manner. Thus he rejected the idea of the role of money as a standard, or measure, of value. Douglas believed that money should act as a medium of communication by which consumers direct the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
