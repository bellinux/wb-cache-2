50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Sun {{engineers}} used non-standard terminology for a number of common components, which makes <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>somewhat</b> confusing. For instance, Mach tasks are referred to as domains, ports as doors, and the kernel as the nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} arena combat {{had never made}} it to the coding stage, so few artifacts from that era of development remain: the game's title, and a text file with the names of fighting teams from every large city in Tamriel, and a brief introduction for them. The concept of traveling teams was eventually left aside as well, because the team's decision to produce a first-person RPG had made <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>somewhat</b> less fun.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> performance, we <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> achievable rate theoretically {{for the two}} proposed protocols, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> four-tiered <b>system</b> has <b>somewhat</b> been eroded due to {{the recent}} {{expansion}} of [...] "tegeződés".|$|R
5000|$|Consonant {{doubling}} after short vowels is {{very common}} in Swedish and other Germanic languages, including English. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> is <b>somewhat</b> inconsistent, especially in loanwords, around consonant clusters and with word-final nasal consonants. Examples: ...|$|R
5000|$|Some Plautdietsch writers {{try to use}} a three case <b>system</b> with <b>the</b> {{definite}} articles, {{without much}} consistency. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> looks <b>somewhat</b> like this, some might use the dative neuter articles, others might not: ...|$|R
50|$|The exact {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> varies <b>somewhat</b> between <b>the</b> five classes of echinoderm. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> {{is part of}} the coelomic cavities of echinoderms, together with the haemal coelom (or haemal system), perivisceral coelom, gonadal coelom and perihaemal coelom.|$|R
50|$|The playable Races in Arcanis {{differ from}} the {{traditional}} races in other Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. There are seven primary races: Dark-kin (infernally tainted), Dwarves (cursed Giants), Elorii (basically Elves, but with some significant differences), Gnomes (offspring of a human and a dwarf), Humans (including the elementally attuned Kio and Undir), Ss'ressen (Lizard-folk), and Val (touched by the gods with different bloodlines depending on which God was their progenitor). While {{in the days of}} the d20srd rules other playable races were allowed—such as Half-Orcs—the most recent Arcanis RPG rules have streamlined <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>somewhat</b> to remove these hold-overs from Dungeons & Dragons.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> is <b>somewhat</b> {{similar to}} <b>the</b> Iroquois <b>system,</b> but distinguishes between the mother's {{side and the}} father's side. Relatives on the mother's {{side of the family}} have more {{descriptive}} terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool {{and used a}} gear wheel which moves the tape forward. It can also be moved by hand. This development hampered the sales of <b>the</b> Betamax <b>system</b> <b>somewhat,</b> because <b>the</b> Betamax cassette geometry prevented a similar development.|$|R
5000|$|In 1921 - 1922 <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was <b>somewhat</b> recast: <b>the</b> {{special reserve}} battalions {{were placed in}} [...] "suspended animation" [...] {{and a number of}} Irish regiments were disbanded on the {{creation}} of the Irish Free State. All remaining regiments were reduced to two regular battalions.|$|R
40|$|Waste reduction, {{material}} reuse, {{and use of}} recycle-content {{products can}} be focused on <b>the</b> management <b>system</b> <b>somewhat.</b> In contrast, material recycling is the technical issue how to create new materials using wastes. Thus, three advanced recycling technologies; 1) Synthetic Lightweight Aggregate technology (SLA), 2) Clean Coal Technology (CCT), and 3) RP- 1 Polymer Identification System are introduced...|$|R
2500|$|Caithness {{is one of}} the Watsonian vice-counties, subdivisions of Britain and Ireland {{which are}} used largely for the {{purposes}} of biological recording and other scientific data-gathering. [...] The vice-counties were introduced by Hewett Cottrell Watson who first used them in the third volume of his [...] published in 1852. He refined <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>somewhat</b> in later volumes, but the vice-counties remain unchanged by subsequent local government reorganisations, allowing historical and modern data to be more accurately compared. They provide a stable basis for recording using similarly-sized units, and, although grid-based reporting has grown in popularity, they remain a standard {{in the vast majority of}} ecological surveys, allowing data collected over long periods of time to be compared easily.|$|R
30|$|A global {{positioning}} and tracking {{system based on}} miniature mobile robots was <b>discussed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>system</b> mainly includes three major subsystems: image acquisition and preprocessing subsystems, robot tag identification and positioning subsystems, and position estimation-based tracking subsystems.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} BioMediator (www. biomediator. org) <b>system</b> and <b>the</b> process of {{executing}} queries on it. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> {{was designed as}} a tool for posing queries across semantically and syntactically heterogeneous data particularly in the biological arena. We use examples from researchers at the University of Washington, and the University of Missouri-Columbia, to <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> BioMediator <b>system</b> architecture, query execution, modifications to <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to support <b>the</b> queries, and summarize our findings and our future directions. Finally, we <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>system's</b> flexibility and generalized approach and give examples of how <b>the</b> <b>system</b> can be extended for a variety of objectives...|$|R
30|$|In this section, the {{modeling}} of Korean nationwide {{power transmission system}} in using EMTP-RV and the various simulations are <b>discussed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>system</b> parameters used in modeling are based on <b>the</b> real <b>system</b> data in PSS/E files provided by KEPCO and KPX [23, 24, 25].|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of CAPS, Disney did not <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> in public, being afraid that the magic would go away if people found out {{computers}} were involved. Computer Graphics World magazine, in 1994, was the first {{to have a look at}} the process.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{earliest}} semitone-apart <b>system</b> was C/C, {{and many}} variants {{have been used}} over the years, notably D/D and G/G. However, since the mid-20th century two main systems have been in widespread use: <b>the</b> B/C <b>system,</b> used mainly for Irish and Scottish music, along with its larger cousin, <b>the</b> B/C/C <b>system</b> (which is now little used outside Scotland); and <b>the</b> C/D <b>system,</b> <b>somewhat</b> less common, used mainly in Irish music. (Irish-American musicians of the mid-20th century used this <b>system</b> with <b>the</b> position of the rows reversed, i.e. D/C.) ...|$|R
50|$|Also in 1941, Packard {{introduced}} the Electro-Matic clutch, {{which was a}} vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by {{the position of the}} accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably {{due to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was <b>somewhat</b> unstable during engine warm-up. Packard's system was used in conjunction with their regular transmission so the H-pattern shifting remained.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> was <b>somewhat</b> complicated, and it {{was removed}} in 1936, being then {{replaced}} by a conventional key token system between Cairn Valley Junction (on the main line) and Dunscore. The other passing places were abolished, and the line from Dunscore to Moniaive was operated under the One Engine in Steam arrangement, with a train staff.|$|R
