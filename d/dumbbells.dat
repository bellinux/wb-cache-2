25|$|The second theory uses grip {{placement}} and angle {{as the primary}} factor in targeting each head. For instance, to target the long head when using <b>dumbbells</b> or cables, the grip should be semi-supinated (hammer) grip where the palms face each other. If using a barbell (EZ grip or straight), the grip should be inside of shoulder width. To target the short head when using <b>dumbbells</b> or cables, grip should be supinated, where the palms are facing up completely. If using a barbell (EZ grip or straight), grip should be outside of shoulder width.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, <b>dumbbells,</b> and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|E

40|$|In the size-weight {{illusion}} (SWI), large objects feel {{lighter than}} equally weighted small objects. In the present study, we investigated whether this powerful weight illusion could influence real-lift behavior-namely, whether individuals would perform more bicep curls with a <b>dumbbell</b> that felt subjectively lighter than with an identically weighted, but heavier-feeling, <b>dumbbell.</b> Participants performed bicep curls {{until they were}} unable to continue with both a large, light-feeling 5 -lb <b>dumbbell</b> and a smaller, heavy-feeling 5 -lb <b>dumbbell.</b> No differences emerged in the amounts of exercise that participants performed with each <b>dumbbell,</b> even though they felt that the large <b>dumbbell</b> was lighter than the small <b>dumbbell.</b> Furthermore, in a second experiment, we found no differences in how subjectively tired participants felt after exercising for a set time with either <b>dumbbell.</b> We did find, however, differences in the lifting dynamics, such that the small <b>dumbbell</b> was moved at a higher average velocity and peak acceleration. These results suggest that the SWI does not appear to influence exercise outcomes, suggesting that perceptual illusions are unlikely to affect one's ability to persevere with lifting weights.

Furthermore, our objective was to compare the muscle activity during static stress (<b>dumbbell</b> kept in one position), and dynamic stress with the vibrating <b>dumbbell</b> (moving in the elbow joint). Methods: Surface electromyography was chosen as an objectification method. Nine healthy women of age between 23 and 26 years participated in this study. A <b>dumbbell</b> of 1, 5 kg weight, 36 Hz vibrating frequency and 1, 3 mm amplitude was used. Results: An increase of electrical activity can be observed in all assessed muscles when stimulated with vibrations. However, this increase can be considered as statistically significant only in case of static stress of the m. biceps and triceps brachii. Results also indicate high activity of the upper part of m. trapezius during exercise with activated vibrations.

40|$|A dumbbell-shaped {{rigid body}} {{can be used}} to {{represent}} certain large spacecraft or asteroids with bimodal mass distributions. Such a <b>dumbbell</b> body is modeled as two identical mass particles connected by a rigid, massless link. Equations of motion for the five degrees of freedom of the <b>dumbbell</b> body in a central gravitational field are obtained. The equations of motion characterize three orbit degrees of freedom, two attitude degrees of freedom, and the coupling between them. The system has a continuous symmetry due to a cyclic variable associated with the angle of right ascension of the <b>dumbbell</b> body. Reduction with respect to this symmetry gives a reduced system with four degrees of freedom. Relative equilibria, corresponding to circular orbits, are obtained from these reduced equations of motion; the stability of these relative equilibria is assessed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{inhibition}} of specific transcription regulatory proteins {{is a new}} approach to control gene expression. The transcriptional activities of DNA-binding proteins can be inhibited by the use of double-stranded oligonucleotides that compete for the binding to their specific target sequences in promoters and enhancers. We used nicked (NDODN-κB) and circular (CDODN-κB) <b>dumbbell</b> DNA oligonucleotides containing a NF-κB binding site to analyze the {{inhibition of}} the NF-κB-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) enhancer. The <b>dumbbell</b> DNA oligonucleotides are stable, short segments of double-stranded DNA with closed nucleotide loops on each end, which confer resistance to exonucleases. The <b>dumbbell</b> and other oligonucleotides (decoys) with the NF-κB sequence were found to compete with the native strand for NF-κB binding. The circular <b>dumbbell</b> and double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides competed with the native strand for binding to the NF-κB binding proteins, while the nicked NF-κB <b>dumbbell</b> was a less effective competitor. In Jurkat T-cells, the <b>dumbbell</b> and other oligonucleotides were tested for their ability to block the activation of the plasmid HIV-NL 4 - 3 Luc. The CDODN-κB strongly inhibits the specific transcriptional regulatory proteins, as compared with the NDODN-κB and the double stranded phosphodiester oligonucleotides. On the other hand, the double stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides could also block this activation, but the effect was non-specific. The circular (CDODN) <b>dumbbell</b> oligonucleotides may efficiently compete for the binding of specific transcription factors within cells, thus providing anti-HIV- 1 or other therapeutic effects...|$|R
