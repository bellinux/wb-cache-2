25|$|In 1972, MRF teams {{carried out}} a number of <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> in Catholic and Irish {{nationalist}} areas of Belfast, some of which were attributed to Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. At least fifteen civilians were shot. MRF members have affirmed the unit's involvement in most of these attacks. There are also allegations that the unit helped loyalists to carry out attacks.|$|E
25|$|While earlier {{attacks were}} typified by <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> in which patrolling policemen were shot by gunmen on passing motorcycles, after 2001 they have {{escalated}} to well-coordinated attacks on police establishments, with police stations and outposts ambushed by well-armed groups subsequently fleeing with stolen arms and ammunition.

500|$|The lyrics on {{the album}} {{received}} criticism and created some controversy. They include many themes associated with gangsta rap, such as violence, promiscuity, street gangs, <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings,</b> crime and drug usage. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the only subject matter {{on the album}} was [...] "violence, drugs, pussy, bitches, dope, guns, and gangsters" [...] and that these themes have become repetitive and unchanged {{in the last ten}} years. Critics noted that Dr. Dre had differed from his effort to [...] "clean-up his act" [...] which he tried to establish with his 1996 single, [...] "Been There, Done That" [...] from Dr. Dre Presents...The Aftermath.|$|E
500|$|Data {{shows that}} most crimes {{reported}} in the city tend to be focused around the downtown city center and its environs. Half of all property crimes are localized in about 6.5 percent of the city. An individual in Spokane has a one in fourteen chance of becoming a victim of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, or arson. Spokane had the fourth highest rate of auto theft in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011 according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. <b>Drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> and drug use, particularly crack cocaine use, became worse in the early 1990s, and four <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> were recorded in December 1993 alone. In the 1990s, a special gang unit within the Spokane Police Department was established, with an officer [...] "collecting intelligence on gang activity and disseminating it to street officers". The 1990s also saw Spokane's most prolific serial killer, Robert Lee Yates, who killed thirteen prostitutes in Spokane's East Sprague red light district and confessed to two others in Tacoma, Washington. The transition of the Spokane Police Department to a community-policing precinct model {{has been successful in}} curbing crime rates since its introduction downtown, and has been expanded citywide. The crime woes are possibly due in part to an imbalance that Spokane County prisons receive of pre-release and work-release prisoners; An investigation by the Tacoma News Tribune found that while Spokane County accounts for 6.21 percent of the inmates in state prisons, it receives a disproportionate 16.73 percent of the inmate population to be released into the general population.|$|E

They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their [...] "Vick" [...] surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city. Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "not much changed" [...] nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident {{said that there was}} drug dealing, <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings,</b> and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many. In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News Daily Press that when he was 10 or 11, [...] "I would go fishing even if the fish weren't biting, just {{to get away from the}} violence and stress of daily life in the projects." ...|$|E

He explained that the items were picked out carefully, as they were things he [...] "carr around every day". In the liner notes, Fiasco parodies drug dealing by replacing liquor with milk and cookies, and <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> by replacing guns with books.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{the use of}} paintball markers {{outside a}} {{regulated}} environment has caused concern. In the United States in 1998, 14-year-old Jorel Lynn Travis was shot with a paintball gun while standing outside a Fort Collins, Colorado ice cream parlor – blinding her in one eye. In 2001, a series of pre-meditated and racially motivated <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> targeted Alaska Natives in Anchorage, Alaska, using a paintball marker.

2500|$|The review {{concluded}} that the album was [...] "curiously uninvolving" [...] and that it [...] "lacks the insight and passion that put the best work {{by the likes of}} Boogie Down Productions, Ice-T and Public Enemy so far ahead of the field." [...] The Richmond Times-Dispatchs Mark Holmberg described the album as [...] "a preacher-provoking, mother-maddening, reality-stinks diatribe that wallows in gangs, doping, <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings,</b> brutal sexism, cop slamming and racism". Newsweek noted that Straight Outta Compton [...] "introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made", and added that [...] "Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention where criminality begins and marketing lets off".|$|E
2500|$|As a {{stronghold of}} the Third Battalion of the Provisional IRA's Belfast Brigade, rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the British Army and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences {{during the early}} 1970s and other periods of high {{political}} tension such as the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, and occurred sporadically {{during the rest of}} that period. [...] The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout The Troubles, particularly to <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings.</b> [...] The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland. [...] The last fatal IRA attack in the area before the ceasefire came in August 1992, when guardsman Damien Shackleton was killed by a sniper.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 San Antonio was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Drive-By City" [...] after San Antonio Police Department {{recorded}} over 1,200 <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> nearly 3.5 per day. That figure dwarfed {{the number in}} other Texas cities, and it unofficially marked San Antonio as the state's drive-by capital. Although {{no part of the}} city was immune, {{the vast majority of the}} violence occurred on the East and West Sides, particularly where poverty was prevalent. Gang members killed each other and innocent bystanders to protect their home turf and drug-selling interests. Housing projects such as Alazan-Apache Courts, Cassiano Homes, East Terrace and Wheatley Courts served as hubs for different groups, sometimes housing multiple rival gangs. By the end of 1993 the city hit a peak in homicides with 230 killings, the highest since 1991 when 211 where killed.|$|E
2500|$|Militant groups {{involved}} in violence include Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. They waged a high-intensity campaign of guerrilla warfare against Israeli {{military and civilian}} targets inside Israel and in the occupied territory, utilizing tactics such as ambushes, sniper attacks, and suicide bombings. Military equipment was mostly imported, while some light arms, hand grenades and explosive belts, assault rifles, and Qassam rockets were indigenously produced. They also increased use of remote-controlled landmines against Israeli armor, a tactic that was highly popular among the poorly armed groups. Car bombs were often used against [...] "lightly hardened" [...] targets such as Israeli armored jeeps and checkpoints. Also, more than 1,500 Palestinian <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> killed 75 people in only {{the first year of}} the Intifada.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{transnational crime}} organization, Mara Salvatrucha, {{also known as}} MS-13, with a membership of some 8,000 to 10,000 members in the US, {{is estimated to be}} predominantly composed of illegal immigrants (with some reporting up to 90%). MS-13 members smuggle illicit drugs, primarily powder cocaine and marijuana, into the US and transport and distribute the drugs throughout the country. Some members also are involved in alien smuggling, assault, <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings,</b> homicide, identity theft, prostitution operations, robbery, and weapons trafficking. With over 3,000 members in Northern Virginia alone making it the largest gang in the region, MS-13 has been targeted by the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force which reports that 40% of arrests from 2003–2008 were of illegal immigrants. It is also reported that 71% of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) gang arrestees under [...] "Operation Community Shield" [...] in Northern Virginia from February 2005 to September 2007, were of EWI [...] "Enter Without Inspection" [...] status.|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 2009, the {{government}} announced in Vancouver, a new anti-gang legislation that would make gang-killing a first degree murder offense with mandatory minimum sentences for <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> of 4 years in prison except for 5 years if committed {{on behalf of a}} gang organization. In the weeks prior to the new bill, there were 18 shootings related to a gang war in the Greater Vancouver Area. Stiffer sentences of at least 14 years in jail for aggravated assault and assault with a weapon against a police officer were also announced. The following day, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson also announced minimum mandatory sentences for drug dealers and traffickers. According to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, one-year sentences would be given for marijuana drug dealing linked to organized crime, two-year sentences for hard drugs trafficking as well as a maximum of 14 years in prison for big pot grow-ups. [...] Ironically, despite Stephen Harper's opposition to marijuana culture, in his last 3 years there has been more marijuana produced than any other time in Canada's history.|$|E
2500|$|The Hells Angels {{carried out}} <b>drive-by</b> <b>shootings</b> (using either AK-47s or M1 carbines) and {{attempted}} bombings on two properties, a tattoo parlour in Dandenong and a gym in Hallam, owned by Comancheros state president Michael [...] "Mick" [...] Murray {{in the early}} hours of September 30, 2013 after several Hells Angels were assaulted while trying to recover stolen motorcycles from the rival club. Within hours of the attacks, the clubhouse of the Hells Angels' Darkside chapter in Seaford, Melbourne was shot at in an apparent retaliation. On October 13, 2013, Victoria police raided every Hells Angels property in the state in an attempt to curb bikie-related violence, seizing guns, ammunition, drugs and cash, and arresting 13 people, but failed to retrieve the assault rifles used in the shootings. Dennis Basic, a prospective member of the Darkside chapter, was arrested for the attempted bombings of the properties and pleaded guilty to thirteen charges which also included firearm and drug possession; having been held in custody since his arrest until the time of his sentencing in December 2015, the judge ruled that the time he had served in jail was sufficient penalty but ordered he serve a 12-month community corrections order.|$|E
