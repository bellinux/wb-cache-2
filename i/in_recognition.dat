40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of bank {{accounting}} conservatism on the pricing of syndicated bank loans. We provide evidence that banks timelier <b>in</b> loss <b>recognition</b> charge higher spreads. We go onto consider {{what happens to the}} relationship between spreads and timeliness <b>in</b> loss <b>recognition</b> during the financial crisis. During the crisis, banks timelier <b>in</b> loss <b>recognition</b> increase their spreads to a lesser extent than banks less timely <b>in</b> loss <b>recognition.</b> These findings are broadly consistent with the argument that conditional accounting conservatism serves a governance role. The policy implication is that banks timelier <b>in</b> loss <b>recognition</b> exhibit more prudent and less pro-cyclical loan pricing behaviour...|$|R
