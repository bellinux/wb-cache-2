40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} provide a qualitative perception of Irish youth substance use according to youth and <b>drugs</b> <b>service</b> providers in Waterford, Ireland. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a self-selecting sample of community, law enforcement, and <b>drug</b> <b>services</b> (N = 42). The research provided detailed knowledge about levels of youth substance use involvement and gaps in regional service provision. The results suggest that adolescents' attitudes and substance using practices have become more liberal and indeed more "normalized," and that <b>drug</b> <b>services</b> may be aiming at a "transient target" of drug and alcohol taking patterns within the rural context. Successful and proactive programs of service delivery must therefore incorporate the complexity of adolescent regional culture, perceptions of risk and maturational processes...|$|R

40|$|Background - Counselling {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{treatment}} options in <b>drug</b> <b>services,</b> and recent research has convincingly demonstrated its effectiveness if certain quality parameters regarding intensity and qualifications of those providing it are observed.

40|$|Opiate use is {{no longer}} {{confined}} to the greater urban context in Ireland, with scant detoxification services present in rural areas (Carew et al, 2009; National Advisory Committee on Drugs, 2008). This exploratory research aimed to yield an illustrative account of opiate users' experiences of self-detoxification by adopting a grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Data emerging from 21 in-depth interviews (n= 12 heroin users, n= 9 <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> providers: statutory, community and voluntary) were analysed using the constant comparative method. The study generated a substantive theory of self-detoxification as a subjective process of seeking heroin abstinence. Self-detoxification emerged as a frequent and reactive or proactive process in collaboration with others (heroin users, family and <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> providers). The study has implications for <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> delivery in rural Ireland in terms of increasing information provision and access to opiate detoxification {{through the development of}} low threshold services and community-based detoxification...|$|E

40|$|This article uses {{qualitative}} {{interviews with}} 53 problematic drug users who {{had dropped out}} of treatment in England, UK to explore how they describe the stigmatisation of drug users and <b>drug</b> <b>services.</b> It discusses the construction of the category of the junkie through its association with un-controlled heroin use and criminality. It shows how some drug users carefully manage information about their discreditable identities by excluding themselves from this category, while acknowledging its validity for other drug users. The junkie identity was generally seen as shameful and therefore to be avoided, although it holds attractions for some drug users. For many of the interviewees, entry to treatment risked exposing their own activities as shaming, as they saw treatment as being a place that was populated by junkies and where it becomes more difficult to manage discreditable information. The treatment regime, e. g. the routine of supervised consumption of methadone, was itself seen by some as stigmatising and was also seen as hindering progress to the desired 'normal' life of conventional employment. Participation in the community of users of both <b>drugs</b> and <b>drug</b> <b>services</b> was perceived as potentially damaging to the prospects of recovery. This emphasises the importance of social capital, including links to people and opportunities outside the drug market. It also highlights the danger that using the criminal justice system to concentrate prolific offenders in treatment may have the perverse effects of excluding other people who have drug problems and of prolonging the performance of the junkie identity within treatment services. It is concluded that treatment agencies should address these issues, including through the provision of more <b>drug</b> <b>services</b> in mainstream settings, {{in order to ensure that}} <b>drug</b> <b>services</b> are not seen to be suitable only for one particularly stigmatised category of drug user.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of novel data mining techniques that convert user interactions in social media networks into readable data that would benefit users, companies, and governments. The readable data can either warn of dangerous side effects of pharmaceutical drugs or improve intervention strategies. A weighted model enabled us to represent user activity in the network, that allowed us to reflect user sentiment of a pharmaceutical <b>drug</b> and/or <b>service.</b> The result is an accurate representation of user sentiment. This approach, when modified for specific diseases, <b>drugs,</b> and <b>services,</b> can enable rapid user feedback that can be converted into rapid responses from consumers to industry and government to withdraw possibly dangerous <b>drugs</b> and <b>services</b> from the market or improve said <b>drugs</b> and <b>services.</b> Our approach monitors social media networks in real-time, enabling government and industry to rapidly respond to consumer sentiment of pharmaceutical <b>drugs</b> and <b>services.</b> QC 20170314 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} had been performed {{in order to}} get general description of the service of an oral complementary drug in the nursing ward of IRNA B of Perjan RS Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo and it evaluated the operation of the oral complementary <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> was, and also found out the correlation of the orderly medication instruction writing of the oral complementary drug, the orderly operation of the process of the oral complementary drug procurement, drug preservation, drug preparation, the hand-over the oral complementary drug to a patient, and Communication, Information and Education (CIE) in the nursing ward of IRNA B relation to the orderly operation of oral complementary <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> procedure. The research used the cross sectional method of survey which was descriptive and analytic in its nature. The research showed that 74, 81 % of the patients medication instruction writing in prescription did not fit the requirements in administration writing and medication information completely. 67, 94 % of the patients bought the prescription (76 %- 100 %) form the drug store in RSCM, 42, 75 % of patients kept the 76 %- 100 % of their drug in the pharmacy depot, 42, 75 % of patients prepared the 76 %- 100 % of patient prepared the 76 %- 100 % of their drug in unites of doses by the pharmacy depot. 64, 12 % of the patients were given their drug by nurses directly, and finished to swallow the drug according to its use direction, and there was none of the patients who got CIE service from a pharmacist. The operation of the oral complementary <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> in the nursing ward of IRNA B was evaluated as less appropriate to the procedure. It could be concluded that there is significant correlation between medication instruction writing, the orderly operation of the process of the oral complementary drug preservation, the drug preparation, the hand-over the oral complementary drug to a patient in the nursing ward of IRNA B with the orderly operation of oral complementary <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> procedure; and there is no correlation between the procurement of the oral complementary drug, the orderly operation of CIE in the nursing ward of IRNA B with the orderly operation of oral complementary <b>drug</b> <b>service</b> procedure...|$|E
