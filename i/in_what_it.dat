In other words, he proposes that each extreme is right <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> affirms, but wrong <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> denies. Both cultural diversity of language, and a learning instinct, can be affirmed; neither need be denied.|$|E

25|$|Plymouth Argyle {{was limited}} <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{could do with}} the stadium {{throughout}} the 1900s, because of a long-standing lease agreement with the City Council. That changed in 2006 when the club purchased the freehold of the ground for £2.7m. Soon after, the club announced it would begin hosting live music in the summer months, starting in 2007, and the first act to perform there was Elton John. Other major acts have followed, including George Michael, Meat Loaf, Westlife, and Rod Stewart. The stadium also hosts an annual free-admittance carol service in December to celebrate Christmas, {{in association with the}} Plymouth branch of Christian organisation Faith and Football.|$|E
25|$|At that point, the U.S. {{had not yet}} {{entered the}} war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a {{situation}} that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Civil rights leader A. J. Muste and Black union leaders A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. This Presidential act defused black anger considerably, although the United States Army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> considered social experimentation.|$|E
25|$|The Cape {{government}} {{on the other hand}} was reluctant to see its local Commandos brought under British imperial command, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> considered to be essentially a local conflict, not an imperial war of conquest. The Cape had only recently attained local democracy and was extremely suspicious of Imperial infringements upon it. It also considered the slow-moving British troop columns to be absurdly unsuitable for frontier warfare – immobile, ineffective and vastly more expensive than local Cape forces. This last point of contention was chiefly exacerbated by Frere's insistence that the Cape's government pay for his imported British imperial troops, as well as its own local forces. The Cape Government on the other hand wanted to fund and use only its own local forces. It did not desire British troops to operate in the Cape Colony in the first place, and especially objected to being forced to fund them.|$|E

[...] Five years to the day after the cartoons were first published in Jyllands-Posten, they were republished in Denmark in Rose's book Tyranny of Silence.

500|$|In May 2014, Nestlé Purina Petcare began a {{legal dispute}} with Blue Buffalo {{regarding}} its advertising practices. In 2015, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Purina, {{claiming that the}} dog food manufactured by the company was hazardous for pets. Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn, whereas Purina said independent lab tests confirmed that they do. Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter-suit {{less than a week}} later. It also alleged Purina was engaging <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> characterized as a [...] "smear campaign". The National Advertising Review Board and the [...] Advertising Self-Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo's advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated. Blue Buffalo said it disagreed, but would obey the ruling.|$|E

500|$|Another failure, {{identified}} by Bracha, is {{not found in}} what the Statute covered, but <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> did not. The Statute did not provide any means for identifying authors, did not identify what constituted authored works, and covered only [...] "books", even while discussing [...] "property" [...] as a whole. Moreover, the right provided was merely that of [...] "making and selling... exact reprints. To a large extent, the new regime was the old stationer's privilege, except it was universalised, capped in time, and formally conferred upon authors rather than publishers". The effect of the Statute on authors was also minimal. Previously, publishers would have bought the original manuscript from writers for a lump sum; {{with the passage of}} the Statute, they simply did the same thing, but with the manuscript's copyright as well. The remaining economic power of the Company also allowed them to pressure booksellers and distributors into continuing their past arrangements, meaning that even theoretically [...] "public domain" [...] works were, in practise, still treated as copyrighted.|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, he spoke of the song giving Kesha a [...] "hussy image" [...] but {{described}} the lyrics in a positive manner. Levine said the use of auto-tune was [...] "fun" [...] and described Dr. Luke's backing track as [...] "bouncy" [...] and [...] "bubblegummy". The review highlighted the song's chorus with Levine calling it [...] "stonking great" [...] and [...] "completely trashy in the best possible way." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic called the track [...] "fun", listing it as one of the album's best tracks. David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound felt that the song was effective <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was trying to do, writing: [...] "Trashy and rambunctious, it’s a brash summer anthem about getting drunk and partying hard. World rocking it might not be, but as a piece of disposable pop it captures a moment and boasts a huge hook which, really, is all you need to rule the radio, TV and ringtone airwaves." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly listed the song as the recommended download off of Animal, writing that [...] "her Valley Girl sneer with electro-glam arrangements that make brushing one's teeth 'with a bottle of Jack' sound like an awesome way to kill the morning-after blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
