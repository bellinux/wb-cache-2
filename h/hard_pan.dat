40|$|Development {{of sensors}} {{to detect the}} {{location}} and depth of <b>hard</b> <b>pans</b> in real time is a major restriction on the application of Site Specific Crop Management (SSCM). In this study, a soil compaction profile sensor equipped with four horizontal operating penetro-meters for on-the-go sensing and mapping of the location and intensity of <b>hard</b> <b>pans</b> arti-ficially formed in a soil bin was developed and tested. The leading edge of a 600 mm long vertical soil cutting blade held four 8 mm diameter, 80 mm long, and 30 degree conic tip stainless steel soil penetrating rods equally spaced at 100 mm vertical intervals. With this arrangement, when the cutting blade was driven into the soil up to a 500 mm depth, the conic tips sensed soil penetration resistances at 100, 200, 300 and 400 mm depths. The penetration resistance force was transmitted by the rod end to the elastic diaphragm of a hydrostatic oil chamber beneath each rod. Each oil chamber was connected to a force magnifying piston and cylinder located off the soil engaging tools.
