25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} antidepressant therapy plus quetiapine on major <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> activity, daytime sleepiness and quality of sleep. METHODS: Patients (N = 27) with major depressive disorder received a standard antidepressant treatment (Venlafaxine, Escitalopram) plus flexible dose of quetiapine. Patients' depression was monitored with HAM-D- 21, motor activity was continuously measured with actigraphy and sleep parameters with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) over 4 weeks. RESULTS: Whereas depression, quality of sleep and daytime sleepiness showed a significant improvement over 4 weeks, change of daytime motor activity was significant only between the wash out period and the last 2 days of the study. Repeated measures of variance indicate an independent influence of quetiapine on improved <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> activity and sleep. While we found only a mild decrease of daytime sleepiness {{during the first week}} of treatment, the further decline of daytime sleepiness got significant after 2 weeks of treatment with quetiapine, even at high mean daily doses and despite the sedative effects of quetiapine. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant treatment plus quetiapine is possibly a suitable treatment strategy to improve clinical depression, quality of sleep and motor activity. Future research is needed to understand the pharmacological interactions between antidepressants and quetiapine in major depression. B. T. Baune, S. Caliskan and D. Todde...|$|E

40|$|The orphan glutamate-like {{receptor}} GluRδ 2 {{is predominantly}} expressed in Purkinje {{cells of the}} central nervous system. The classification of GluRδ 2 to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family is based on sequence similarities, because GluRδ 2 does not form functional homomeric glutamate-gated ion channels in transfected cells. Studies in GluRδ 2 −/− knockout mice {{as well as in}} mice with naturally occurring mutations in the GluRδ 2 gene have demonstrated an essential role of GluRδ 2 in cerebellar long-term <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> learning, motor coordination, and synaptogenesis. However, the lack of a known agonist has hampered investigations on the function of GluRδ 2. In this study, the ligand-binding core of GluRδ 2 (GluRδ 2 –S 1 S 2) was found to bind neutral amino acids such as d-serine and glycine, as demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Direct evidence for binding of d-serine and structural rearrangements in the binding cleft of GluRδ 2 –S 1 S 2 is provided by x-ray structures of GluRδ 2 –S 1 S 2 in its apo form and in complex with d-serine. Functionally, d-serine and glycine were shown to inactivate spontaneous ion-channel conductance in GluRδ 2 containing the lurcher mutation (EC 50 values, 182 and 507 μM, respectively). These data demonstrate that the GluRδ 2 ligand-binding core is capable of binding ligands and that cleft closure of the ligand-binding core can induce conformational changes that alter ion permeation...|$|E
40|$|Glutamate {{receptor}} GluRδ 2 is exclusively {{expressed in}} Purkinje cells (PCs) from early development and plays key roles in parallel fiber (PF) synapse formation, elimination of surplus climbing fibers (CFs), long-term <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> coordination, and motor learning. To address {{its role in}} adulthood, we previously developed a mouse model of drug-induced GluRδ 2 ablation in adult PCs (Takeuchi et al., 2005). In that study, we demonstrated an essential role to maintain the connectivity of PF-PC synapses, based on the observation that both mismatching of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations and disconnection of PF-PC synapses are progressively increased after GluRδ 2 ablation. Here, we pursued its role for CF wiring in adult cerebellum. In parallel with the disconnection of PF-PC synapses, ascending CF branches exhibited distal extension to innervate distal dendrites of the target and neighboring PCs. Furthermore, transverse CF branches, a short motile collateral rarely forming synapses in wild-type animals, displayed aberrant mediolateral extension to innervate distal dendrites of neighboring and remote PCs. Consequently, many PCs were wired by single main CF and other surplus CFs innervating {{a small part of}} distal dendrites. Electrophysiological recording further revealed that surplus CF-EPSCs characterized with slow rise time and small amplitude emerged after GluRδ 2 ablation, and increased progressively both in number and amplitude. Therefore, GluRδ 2 is essential for maintaining CF monoinnervation in adult cerebellum by suppressing aberrant invasion of CF branches to the territory of PF innervation. Thus, GluRδ 2 fuels heterosynaptic competition and gives PFs the competitive advantages over CFs throughout the animal's life...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the quality and}} duration of the analgesic and haemodynamic effects of clonidine when used as an additional analgesic for postoperative epidural analgesia in major vascularsurgery. Methods The prospective, single-blinded study involved 60 patients randomised into three groups (20 patients each) : Group BM—bupivacaine 0. 125 % and morphine 0. 1 mg/ml; Group BC—bupivacaine 0. 125 % and clonidine 5 μg/ml; Group MC—morphine 0. 1 mg/ml and clonidine 5 μg/ml continuously infused at 5 ml/h. The quality and duration of the analgesia measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at rest and on movement, additional analgesia requirements, sedation scores, haemodynamic parameters and side effects(respiratory <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> block, toxic effects, nausea and pruritus) were recorded. Results The average VAS scores at rest and on movement were significantly lower in Group MC at two, six and 24 hours following the start of epidural infusion (P< 0. 05). The duration of the analgesic effect after finishing the epidural infusion was significantly longer in Group MC (P< 0. 05). Patients from Group MC were intubated longer. Additional analgesia consumption, sedation scoresand haemodynamic profiles were similar in all three groups. Prurituswas more frequent in morphine groups (P< 0. 05), but other sideeffects were similar in all three groups. Conclusion Under study conditions, clonidine added to morphine,not 0. 125 % bupivacaine, provided significantly better pain scoresat two, six and 24 hours following the start of epidural infusionand the longest-lasting analgesia following the discontinuationof epidural infusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{diagnostic}} entity {{of major}} depressive episode includes both simple and agitated or mixed depression. Mixed depression {{is characterized by a}} full depressive episode with several symptoms of excitatory nature. Mixed depressions worsen if treated with antidepressants. METHOD: We have reviewed the clinical charts of the 2141 patients treated at the Centro Lucio Bini of Rome from January 1999 to June 2006. These patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Research diagnostic criteria were applied for agitated <b>depression</b> with <b>motor</b> agitation and Author's diagnostic criteria for agitated <b>depression</b> without <b>motor</b> agitation. RESULTS: One thousand and twenty-six patients had a depressive episode as index episode. Three hundred and forty six (33 %) were mixed depressive states. One hundred and thirty eight (44 %) of them were spontaneous; in 173 cases, the onset of the mixed depression was associated with antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Psychic and motor agitation are considered equally important for the definition of agitated depression. Treating agitated depression with antidepressants worsens the clinical picture. The use of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), neuroleptics and anticonvulsants are recommended. The term Melancholia Agitata is proposed for agitated (mixed) depression...|$|R

METHOD: Twenty PD patients with and without depression were randomly assigned to receive trazodone (group 1) or not (group 2). They were evaluated through UPDRS and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). RESULTS: For the UPDRS the mean score of group 2 was 33. 1 ± 19. 7 and 37. 1 ± 18. 0 at the end. For the group 1, the corresponding scores were 31. 4 ± 11. 3 and 25. 9 ± 13. 7. The variations in the Mann-Whitney test were 0. 734 at the initial moment and 0. 208 at the final moment. The variation in the comparison of the initial moment with the final moment was 0. 005 providing statistical significance. For the HAM-D, the mean score went up 4 points in group 2, contrary to a 5. 5 points decrease in group 1. CONCLUSION: Data analysis shows that this agent significantly improves <b>depression,</b> but the <b>motor</b> function improved only in the depressed patients. Because of the known anti-dopaminergic property of the 5 -HT 2 c receptors, a possible approach for depression in PD could be the use of 5 -HT 2 c antagonists, similarly to the use of atypical neuroleptics in case of psychotic symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThis study examined whether muscle fatigue alters the facilitatory effect of motor imagery on corticospinal excitability. We aimed to determine if post-exercise depression of potentials evoked magnetically from the motor cortex is associated with alterations in internally generated movement plans. In experiment 1, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from two right hand and two right forearm muscles, at rest and during motor imagery of a maximal handgrip contraction, in eight neurologically normal subjects, before and after a 2 -min maximal voluntary handgrip contraction. Resting MEP amplitude was facilitated by motor imagery in three of the four muscles, but consistently only in two. Motor imagery also reduced the trial-to-trial variability of resting MEPs. Following the exercise, resting MEP amplitude was depressed reliably in only one muscle engaged in the task, although two other muscles exhibited some <b>depression.</b> <b>Motor</b> imagery MEPs were smaller after exercise, but the degree of facilitation compared to the rest MEP was unchanged. In experiment 2, TMS intensity was increased after exercise-induced MEP depression so that the MEP amplitude matched the pre-exercise baseline. The amplitude of the MEP facilitated with motor imagery was not altered by MEP depression, nor was it increased when the TMS intensity was increased. These results suggest, at least with a simple motor task, that while post-exercise depression reduces corticospinal excitability, it does not appear to significantly affect the strength of the input to the motor cortex from those areas of the brain responsible for the storage and generation of internal representations of movement.

40|$|Post-stroke fatigue is {{a common}} problem that may limit {{participation}} in everyday activities.

A convenience sample of stroke survivors (n= 20) from retirement communities in southeastern PA were {{invited to participate in the}} research. Participants were screened for <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> and cognitive recovery, and sleep quality. Fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and activity participation was measured using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale- Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (PSMS-IADL). The measures were administered in a double pre-test, double post-test format over three seven-week phases; a non-intervention period; a group-based intervention period, and a post-intervention period. Qualitative information was gathered using a self-made Intervention Satisfaction Survey. Data analysis involved measures of central tendency for the demographic information. Tabulations of the survey responses were completed to judge the effectiveness of the group-based program or its’ components from the participants’ perspectives. Results indicated a statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue post-intervention (p=. 022), which continued for seven-weeks (p=. 240). There was a strong effect size for the post-intervention reduction of fatigue (r=. 69). There was a trend toward improved participation in daily activities. Distribution across groups for presence of social support, age, sex, and level of care was found to be equivalent after one-way chi square analysis. There was no significant influence of these variables on fatigue or participation when used as grouping variables in RM-ANOVA. Participants reported feeling most confident scheduling activity to include rest periods and least confident managing sleep problems. Limitations include small sample size, demographics not being representative of the general stroke population, use of self-report measures with possible ceiling effect of PSMS-IADL, instrumentation effect given multiple administrations, and history effects as groups occurred at different time of the year. Overall, the results indicate that participation in a group-based educational program was effective in reducing post-stroke fatigue in chronic stroke...|$|E

Objetivou-se avaliar a seguranÃa da ritalinaÂ, em animais adultos, contemplando aspectos de neuro e nefrotoxicidade. Avaliou-se os efeitos do Metilfenidato utilizando modelos neurocomportamentais de avaliaÃÃo de ansiedade, depressÃo, atividade locomotora e convulsÃo, apÃs tratamento agudo em animais adultos, identificou-se os seus efeitos sobre os nÃveis de monoaminas no hipocampo e corpo estriado, investigou-se a atividade da acetilcolinesterase em hipocampo e corpo estriado (modelo colinÃrgico de convulsÃo), avaliou-se o efeito do MFD em rim isolado, em cÃlulas tubulares renais sobre a viabilidade e proliferaÃÃo da linhagem celular em estudo e avaliou-se os parÃmetros bioquÃmicos renais in vivo. O MFD aumentou todos os parÃmetros analisados nos testes do labirinto em cruz elevado, comprovando seu efeito ansiolÃtico, aumentou a atividade locomotora no teste do campo aberto, nÃo alterando o {{grooming}} e rearing, sugerindo um efeito ansiolÃtico e desinibitÃrio; No teste do rota rod, a coordenaÃÃo motora dos animais nÃo foi alterada, mostrando que os efeitos do MFD nÃo se relacionam com o bloqueio neuromuscular perifÃrico, mas sim, ocasionados centralmente; O MFD apresentou efeito antidepressivo no teste do nado forÃado, pois diminuiu o tempo de imobilidade dos animais, sugerindo uma maior investigaÃÃo nesse contexto, uma vez que o fÃrmaco nÃo Ã usado na clÃnica como antidepressivo. Verificou-se o aumento da concentraÃÃo das aminas biÃgenas estudadas, corroborando com o efeito antidepressivo observado no modelo nado forÃado. No teste da convulsÃo induzida por pilocarpina, o MFD diminuiu as latÃncias de convulsÃo e de morte, demonstrando uma atividade proconvulsivante. AlÃm disso, reduziu a atividade da AChE no corpo estriado, sugerindo um possÃvel mecanismo colinÃrgico para potencializaÃÃo das convulsÃes no modelo do P 400. O MFD reduziu o fluxo urinÃrio, o ritmo de filtraÃÃo glomerular e o percentual de transporte tubular de sÃdio (%TNa+) quando comparado com o grupo controle. Nos experimentos in vivo, com 24 e 48 horas apÃs tratamento com MFD, os parÃmetros da funÃÃo renal: urÃia, creatinina, clearence de creatinina, excreÃÃo de Na+ e K+ nÃo foram alterados. O MFD nÃo causou alteraÃÃes histolÃgicas em rins apÃs 24 e 48 h de tratamento. Nos testes com cÃlulas tubulares renais MDCK, o MFD nÃo causou reduÃÃo na viabilidade das cÃlulas epiteliais renais do tÃbulo distal. Diante dos resultados, embora o MFD pareÃa ser uma opÃÃo segura para o tratamento do TDAH, ele deve ser utilizado com cautela, uma vez que foram detectadas alteraÃÃes nos parÃmetros de funÃÃo renal, sugerindo um possÃvel efeito nefrotÃxico, devendo ser investigado em maior profundidade, a fim de avaliar a intensidade desses efeitos em longo prazo. The methylphenidate (MFD) is {{the most}} widely used psychostimulant in Brazil for the treatment of Deficit Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), very frequent neuropsychiatric disorder of childhood, children in school age and adolescence, but is being very prescribed, creating the need to study the safety of its use. The objective was to evaluate the safety of Ritalin in adult animals, covering aspects of neuro- and nephrotoxicity. We evaluated the effects of methylphenidate using neurobehavioural assessment models of anxiety, <b>depression,</b> <b>motor</b> activity and convulsions after acute treatment in adults, it was identified their effects on monoamines levels in the hippocampus and striatum, we investigated the activity of acetylcholinesterase in hippocampus and striatum (cholinergic seizure model), evaluated the effect of MFD in isolated kidney in renal tubular cells on the viability and proliferation of the cell line being studied and evaluated the kidney biochemical parameters in vivo. The MFD increased all parameters analyzed in maze tests at high cross, proving its anxiolytic effect, increased locomotor activity in the open field test, not changing the grooming and rearing, suggesting an anxiolytic effect and desinibitÃrio; In the test route rod, motor skills of the animals was not affected, indicating that the effects of the MFD is not related to the peripheral neuromuscular blockade, but rather caused centrally; The MFD showed antidepressant effect in the forced swimming test, it decreased the immobility time of animals, suggesting further investigation in this context, since the drug is not used in the clinic as an antidepressant. There was an increase in the concentration of biogenic amines studied, corroborating the antidepressant effect observed in the forced swimming model. The test of seizures induced by pilocarpine, the MFD decreased the seizure latency and death, showing a proconvulsivante activity. In addition, decreased AChE activity in the striatum, suggesting a possible mechanism for enhancement of cholinergic seizures in the P 400 model. The MFD reduced urine flow, glomerular filtration and tubular transport of sodium percentage (Tna +%) compared with the control group. In in vivo experiments, with 24 and 48 hours after treatment with MFD, the parameters of renal function: urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance, excretion of Na + and K + have not changed. The MFD did not cause histological changes in kidneys after 24 and 48 h of treatment. In tests with renal tubular cells MDCK, the MFD did not reduce the viability of renal epithelial cells of the distal tubule. From the results, although the MFD appears to be a safe choice for the treatment of ADHD, it should be used with caution, since changes were detected in the parameters of renal function, suggesting a possible nephrotoxic effect and should be investigated in more depth, to evaluate the intensity of these long-term effects...|$|E

Methods: A total sample of 95 nondemented older adults performed Geriatric Depression Scale short version, Frontal Assessment Battery, Five Digit Test, Digit Span and clinical interview. We split participants in groups stratified by age according to: young-old (60 - 69 years of age), old-old (70 - 79 years) and oldest-old (> 80 years) and compared these three groups on the sociodemographic characteristics and executive functions performance. We carried out Poisson regression with robust error variance to verify sleep complaints and depression effects on executive functions performance. Gender, age, years of formal education, use of antidepressants and of benzodiazepines were considered as confounding variables, taking into account executive functions as dependent and sleep complaints and depression as independent variables. Results: Controlling the effect of age, gender, years of formal education, use of benzodiazepines and of antidepressants {{there was a significant}} influence of <b>depression</b> in <b>motor</b> programming, inhibitory control and working memory.

But when he got behind the wheel he became the Wizard, his command uncanny, the speeds breathless. In league with engineer Don Harkness, who designed and built the Enterprise, he was pointing Australia toward a brighter future. Until somewhere along the line, things started going wrong. What really happened on that lonely beach? Clinton Walker lays bare the tragic fall from grace of Norman 'Wizard' Smith - an ordinary man lost to an extraordinary quest, and, until now, a forgotten figure. 273 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Motor {{imagery is}} a {{potential}} tool to investigate action representation, {{as it can provide}} insights into the processes of action planning and preparation. Recent studies suggest that depressed patients present specific impairment in mental rotation. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of unipolar <b>depression</b> on <b>motor</b> imagery ability. Methods: Fourteen right-handed patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for unipolar depression were compared to 14 matched healthy controls. Imagery ability was accessed by the timing correspondence between executed and imagined movements during a pointing task, involving strong spatiotemporal constraints (speed/accuracy trade-off paradigm). Results: Compared to controls, depressed patients showed marked motor slowing on both actual and imagined movements. Furthermore, we observed greater temporal discrepancies between actual and mental movements in depressed patients than in healthy controls. Lastly, depressed patients modulated, to some extent, mental movement durations according to the difficulty of the task, but this modulation was not as strong as that of healthy subjects. Conclusion:These results suggest that unipolar depression significantly affects the higher stages of action planning and point out a selective decline of motor prediction...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of low doses of haloperidol on the open-field behavior of mice. A three-phase effect of haloperidol on the motor activity of mice was observed (depression, no effect, depression). This three-phase action was clear-cut in three experimental approaches (amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and apomorphine- and bromocriptine-induced hypoactivity). A differential action of haloperidol on dopamine receptors mediating motor stimulation and <b>motor</b> <b>depression</b> was proposed. the present data indicate that considerably more attention should be paid to the novel behavioral and biochemical actions of neuroleptic drugs in the microgram dose range.

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), both {{the patient and the}} health care provider look for ways to preserve the patient’s quality of life. Many studies focus on the impact of <b>depression</b> and <b>motor</b> disability on poor life quality but neglect to examine the role of anxiety. We investigated the impact of anxiety and depression on health-related quality of life in PD, using the Parkinson’s Disease Quality of Life measure (PDQ- 39). Symptoms of anxiety, more than depression, cognitive status, or motor stage, significantly affected quality of life in 38 nondemented patients with mild-to-moderate motor disability. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that anxiety explained 29 % {{of the variance in the}} PDQ- 39 sum score, and depression explained 10 % of the variance beyond that accounted for by anxiety. The findings suggest that primary management of anxiety as well as depression may be important to optimizing the quality of life of PD patients. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{anaesthetic}} protocol, based on a premedication with atropine and azaperone (Stresnil ®) and the anesthetic induction with a 0. 5 % ketamine solution, were studied in 25 healthy adults rabbits. Each animal was premed with 0. 04 mg/kg b. w. atropine, and 1. 5 mg/kg azaperone to provide relaxation and decrease the muscle hyper-tonus produced by the dissociative anesthetic. After each drug administration, the physiologic parameter measure was registered. The ketamine induction was done with a 0. 5 % ketamine solution, and the induction {{was determined by the}} lost of both, the straight head and the righting reflex. The heart rate, respiratory rate and arterialblood pressure were determined and registered every 5 minutes, the body temperature was controlled every 15 minutes, every measurement was done until the moment of recovery of the both previously mentioned reflex. The average dose of ketamine injected to achieve the induction anesthetic state, the time it takes the administration of that ketamine dose, the resultant surgical anesthetic period in minutes, and the post anesthetic <b>motor</b> <b>depression</b> time, were also determined and recorded. The average I. V. dose induction of 0, 5 % ketamine solution was 4. 49 mg/kg of body weigh, injectedin a average time of 9. 56 seconds, providing a surgical anesthetic period of 10. 64 minutes followed by a post anesthetic <b>motor</b> <b>depression</b> period of 5. 64 minutes. Under the {{effects of the}} anesthetics drugs association conforming this protocol, almost all physiological parameters remains in the normal ranges described for the specie, only the arterial blood pressure exhibited an average value under the normal value given for rabbits in the literature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStroke {{survivors}} show {{a variety}} of physical and psychosocial problems, which can affect their reintegration into the community. This study explored the association of community reintegration with motor function and post-stroke depression (PSD). Ninety community-dwelling stroke survivors with mean age of 58. 3  ±  7. 8 years participated in this study. Participants were 56 men and 34 women attending the physiotherapy clinics of selected hospitals in southwestern Nigeria. Motor function was assessed using the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS), PSD by the Hamilton Depression Scale, and community reintegration by the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI). The mean RNLI, MAS, and PSD scores were 57. 3  ±  23. 5, 34. 9  ±  10. 9, and 9. 4  ±  4. 8, respectively. RNLI scores {{were significantly associated with}} MAS (r =  0. 584, p =  0. 001) and PSD (r = − 0. 373, p =  0. 006) scores. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, <b>depression,</b> and <b>motor</b> function were associated with RNLI scores, which accounted for 41 % of the variance. This study concluded that the higher the community reintegration, the higher the motor function, and the lower the PSD. <b>Motor</b> function and <b>depression</b> are factors that influence community reintegration and should be properly assessed and adequately treated before stroke survivors return to the community...|$|R
40|$|In the cerebellum, Delphilin is {{expressed}} selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) and is localized exclusively at parallel fiber (PF) synapses, where it interacts with glutamate receptor (GluR) d 2 {{that is essential}} for long-term <b>depression</b> (LTD), <b>motor</b> learning and cerebellar wiring. Delphilin ablation exerted {{little effect on the}} synaptic localization of GluRd 2. There were no detectable abnormalities in cerebellar histology, PC cytology and PC synapse formation in contrast to GluRd 2 mutant mice. However, LTD induction was facilitated at PF-PC synapses in Delphilin mutant mice. Intracellular Ca 2 + required for the induction of LTD appeared to be reduced in the mutant mice, while Ca 2 + influx through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and metabotropic GluR 1 -mediated slow synaptic response were similar between wild-type and mutant mice. We further showed that the gain-increase adaptation of the optokinetic response (OKR) was enhanced in the mutant mice. These findings are compatible with the idea that LTD induction at PF-PC synapses is a crucial rate-limiting step in OKR gain-increase adaptation, a simple form of motor learning. As exemplified in this study, enhancing synaptic plasticity at a specific synaptic site of a neural network is a useful approach to understanding the roles of multiple plasticity mechanisms at variou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is {{commonly}} used to assess symptoms of anxiety and <b>depression</b> in <b>motor</b> neurone disease (MND). The measure has never been specifically validated for use within this population, despite questions raised about the scale's validity. This study seeks to analyse {{the construct validity of}} the HADS in MND by fitting its data to the Rasch model. Methods The scale was administered to 298 patients with MND. Scale assessment included model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), unidimensionality, local dependency and category threshold analysis. Results Rasch analyses were carried out on the HADS total score as well as depression and anxiety subscales (HADS-T, D and A respectively). After removing one item from both of the seven item scales, it was possible to produce modified HADS-A and HADS-D scales which fit the Rasch model. An 11 -item higher-order HADS-T total scale was found to fit the Rasch model following the removal of one further item. Conclusion Our results suggest that a modified HADS-A and HADS-D are unidimensional, free of DIF and have good fit to the Rasch model in this population. As such they are suitable for use in MND clinics or research. The use of the modified HADS-T as a higher-order measure of psychological distress was supported by our data. Revised cut-off points are given for the modified HADS-A and HADS-D subscales. </p...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} into the psychological consequences of traumatic events has largely focused on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although other anxiety disorders and depression are also common {{in the aftermath of}} trauma. Little is known about differential predictors of these conditions. The present study investigated the extent to which theoretically derived cognitive variables predict PTSD, phobias and <b>depression</b> after <b>motor</b> vehicle accidents. The cognitive predictors were compared to a set of established, mainly non-cognitive predictors. In addition, we tested how disorder-specific the cognitive predictors are. Participants (n= 101) were interviewed within a year after having been injured in a motor vehicle accident. Diagnoses of PTSD, travel phobias and depression, symptom severities and predictor variables were assessed with self-report questionnaires and structured interviews. In multiple regression analyses, the sets of cognitive variables derived from disorder-specific models explained significantly greater proportions of the variance of the symptom severities than the established predictors (PTSD 76 % vs. 45 %, depression 72 % vs. 46 % and phobia 66 % vs. 40 %), and than cognitive variables derived from the models of the other disorders. In addition, the majority of individual cognitive variables showed the expected pattern of differences between diagnostic groups. The results support the hypothesis that disorder-specific sets of cognitive factors contribute to the development and maintenance of PTSD, phobias and depression following traumatic events...|$|R
