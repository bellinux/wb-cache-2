5|$|<b>During</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century, {{the penny}} {{was a small}} silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity.

In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E

5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area <b>during</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times.

Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
