5|$|U.S. Representative Chet Edwards of Waco, Texas, {{successfully}} {{introduced legislation}} to <b>earmark</b> $150 million toward {{a cure for}} neuroblastoma and other cancers. The measure {{was signed into law}} in July 2008 by U.S. President George W. Bush. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997–2009) of Bryan, daughter of one of his constituents, Walter L.

5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an <b>earmark</b> of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, {{pointing out that the}} U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010. An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.|$|E
5|$|The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge {{across the}} Arkansas River, {{originally}} leading to Choctaw Station, {{has been converted}} into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of the library's opening, Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year land lease from the state. In 2009, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million <b>earmark</b> for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010. On September 30, 2011, Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge, which opened to the public on October 2, 2011.|$|E
40|$|The <b>earmarking</b> (or setting aside) of {{revenues}} from various taxes for {{specific types of}} expenditure is a much-maligned fiscal practice.

25|$|In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana House {{delegation}} {{and ranked}} 14th among House members in requested <b>earmark</b> funding at nearly $97 million (however in over 99% of these requests, Jindal was a co-sponsor {{and not the}} primary initiator of the <b>earmark</b> legislation). $5 million of Jindal's <b>earmark</b> requests were for state defense and indigent healthcare related expenditures, another $50 million was for increasing the safety of Louisiana's waterways and levees after breaches following Hurricane Katrina, and the remainder was targeted towards coastal restoration and alternative energy research. As governor, in 2008, Jindal used his line item veto to strike $16 million in earmarks from the state budget but declined to veto $30 million in legislator-added spending. Jindal vetoed over 250 earmarks in the 2008 state budget, twice {{the total number of}} such vetoes by previous governors in the preceding 12 years.|$|E

40|$|It {{should not}} be assumed that <b>earmarked</b> donor funding {{automatically}} increases the allocation of developing-country resources towards programmes that yield the greatest health benefits. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not [...] how the funding is designed can influence this. This is true particularly in the longer term, once the <b>earmarked</b> funding has ended. Even in the short term, total funding does not necessarily increase because of fungibility (i. e. recipient governments adjust their spending to offset donor funding preferences). The author explores six problems with <b>earmarked</b> funding: the multiplicity of <b>earmarked</b> funds confuses the situation for decision-makers; <b>earmarking</b> works against {{the spirit of the}} sectorwide approach; from the national perspective, it makes sense not to double-fund activities; local ownership of an activity is often compromised; <b>earmarking</b> can lead governments to accept interventions which they cannot afford in the longer term; and <b>earmarking</b> can distort local resource allocation...|$|R

[...] <b>Earmarking</b> can also mean [...] "dedicating collections by law for a specific purpose." [...] In some cases, legislative language may direct federal agencies to spend funds for specific projects. In other cases, <b>earmarks</b> refer to directions in appropriation committee reports, which are not law. Various organizations have estimated the total number and amount of <b>earmarks.</b> An estimated 16,000 <b>earmarks</b> containing nearly $48 billion in spending were inserted into larger, often unrelated bills during 2005.

40|$|Congressional <b>earmarks</b> {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} political debate in recent years. Also known as “pork barrel spending,” <b>earmarks</b> are budgetary requests made by a single legislator that typically circumvent the traditional competitive bidding process designed to ensure the efficient use of public dollars. Utilizing annual state-level estimates of pork barrel spending, we briefly examine the factors influencing states’ receipt of <b>earmarked</b> funds from Congress. Results indicate that on average smaller states receive the largest amount of per capita <b>earmarked</b> funding, most likely as a result of their disproportionate influence in the Senate. In addition, the presence of a Republican Congressional delegation increases pork spending in the state. Finally, the tenure of a state’s senior Senator has a large effect on the state’s receipt of <b>earmarked</b> funds. Each additional year of Senate experience by a state’s senior Senator results in a $ 4. 48 increase in <b>earmarked</b> dollars per capita for that state’s residents. pork barrel spending, pork, <b>earmarks,</b> government spending...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} legislative spending in which revenues can be spent through <b>earmarks</b> or a general fund. Legislative choice is modeled as a Baron and Ferejohn style legislative bargaining game.

This drives the result that all revenue is spent by way of <b>earmarking</b> leaving no revenue in the general fund. <b>Earmarking,</b> legislative bargaining, public goods. ...|$|R
