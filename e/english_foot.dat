5|$|On the left, on {{the other}} hand, Count William Louis of Nassau {{advanced}} with the remaining Dutch cavalry but was halted by the musketry fire of the 200 men standing on the advanced ditch. Aiming to disrupt the Dutch right, Verdugo then charged ahead of Frate's Albanian company and that of Baron de Bievres. The Dutch horse, disorganized by the musketry fire, could not resist Verdugo's rush and turned back, breaking the order, in turn, of the <b>English</b> <b>foot</b> standing behind. To capitalize on this success, Verdugo ordered his foot to follow up the victory. Unaware of the Spanish success {{on the other}} side of the field, the English infantry continued pressing back the Spanish right flank until they reached the Spanish camp. When they realized what had happened, however, the Englishmen turned back in a vain attempt to escape. The Spanish centre and left were blocking the way, and thus the English attempted to save themselves fleeing across the bogged ditches, only to be killed in large numbers.|$|E

At the same time a detached number of Spanish forces led by Mendoza and Ambrosio Spinola pursued Maurice but undeterred the besiegers pressed on towards Grave.|$|E

On it was an important town of the same name to the north of Bergen op Zoom, {{on the opposite side of}} the channel of the Scheldt separating the island from the mainland of Brabant.

This was confirmed by an English spy in Spain who commented on the Spanish confusion and misfortune in the aftermath but bragged about what they would do next Spring. Plymouth and Milford Haven's defences were also improved as well as militia units trained in the art of war.

2500|$|The voet ("foot") was of {{the same}} order of {{magnitude}} as the <b>English</b> <b>foot</b> (30.48cm), but its exact size varied {{from city to city}} and from province to province.

[...] The Rijnland foot which had been in use since 1621 was most commonly used voet in the both Netherlands and in parts of Germany.

Never had the unfortunate king so fair a prospect of being restored to his inheritance of the Palatinate as at that time, and had King James, his father-in-law, had a soul answerable to the occasion, it had been effected before, but it was a strange thing to see him equipped from the English court with one lord and about forty or fifty English gentlemen in his attendance, whereas had the King of England now, as 'tis well known he might have done, furnished him with 10,000 or 12,000 <b>English</b> <b>foot,</b> nothing could have hindered him taking a full possession of his country; and yet even without that help did the King of Sweden clear almost his whole country of Imperialists, and after his death reinstal his son in the Electorate; but no thanks to us.|$|E
