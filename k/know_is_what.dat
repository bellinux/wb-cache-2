25|$|From {{the above}} angle sum formula {{we can also}} see that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If we draw an {{arbitrarily}} small triangle {{in the neighborhood of}} one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Yori and her user, Dr. Lora Baines, {{do not appear}} in the sequel, even though the film refers to Alan Bradley being married to Lora. Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about people talking about the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't tell you how warm a feeling I get from that. It just means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E
500|$|In general, [...] "I Hate December" [...] has {{a darker}} theme that is rarely heard in Christmas music. Durand {{talks about her}} fears of death, singing: [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I dream / But lately dreams have been such scary things / Of suicide and frozen ice over my pale body". Trouser Press editor Ira A. Robbins joked that with Lately, Ivy was {{attempting}} to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. In his book The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, Robbins and Vickie Gilmer summarized it as an [...] "original [...] wah-wahing" [...] song recorded in the [...] "City of Lights". On an episode of the MTV2 music program 120 Minutes, Schlesinger described the message behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] as [...] "anti-Christian". In response, host Matt Pinfield compared the lyrics and inspiration behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] to [...] "that Fear single [...] years ago" [...] (referring to that band's 1982 single [...] "Fuck Christmas").|$|E

500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ... What I need to <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> is he running for?" ...|$|E

His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E
