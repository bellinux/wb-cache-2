Althoughfossil fuels are {{the main source of}} the current energy consumption, their adverse effects on the {{environment}} are catalyzing studies of new sources of clean energy generation. Piezoelectric energy generator, harvesting electrical energy from various mechanical sources such as mechanical vibra-tion, 1 ultrasonic wave, 2 and even sound noise, 3 is one of the promising green methods of energy generation.

The paper is focused on two separate benefits, which HNB could bring an operator and user. Femtocells are <b>especially</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the freedom of installation, increased macro network capacity, femto zone rates and etc. They provide users with better service quality, including voice service and higher throughput; while operators can reduce their network deployment expenditures.

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau de Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2014, Tutor: Dr. Eliseo Ruiz SabínRecently, spin-crossover {{complexes}} {{have been}} <b>especially</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their electron transport ability amongst other useful properties. By switching its spin state this conductance can be modified, even cancelled. Thus, SCO complexes {{can be used}} in new electronic and spintronic devices, such as memories, nanoparticle electronics and single-molecule devices by changing their spin state by many external stimuli, such as temperature, pressure or light, which are truly easy controllable parameters. This work focuses on mononuclear coordination complexes taking into consideration different metallic centres (FeII, CoII, CrII, MnIII and MnII) to gather information about their conducting ability. The study has been performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods with six different exchange-correlation functionals (B 3 LYP, B 2 PLYP, TPSSh, OPBE, M 06 and ωB 97 x) in order to compare their accuracy in the estimation of the energy difference between high- and low-spin states. Hence, a universal functional for any metallic complex can be defined, as until now only FeII systems have been exhaustively studied in the spin transition field. Results obtained show that for the thirteen compounds studied, the functional that has best performed is the hybrid TPSSh. One of the FeII compounds studied, [Fe(amp) 2 Cl 2], {{has been found to be}} the best candidate to become a single-molecule device, generating a β-polarised current when a differential of potential is applied. Otherwise, the other compounds researched showed a mediocre conducting ability. Therefore, further research is required in order to obtain more potential candidates to become single-molecule devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{database}} {{community has}} devoted extensive amount {{of efforts to}} indexing and querying temporal data in the past decades. However, insufficient amount of {{attention has been paid}} to temporal ranking queries. More precisely, given any time instance t, the query asks for the top-k objects at time t with respect to some score attribute. Some generic indexing structures based on R-trees do support ranking queries on temporal data, but as they are not tailored for such queries, the performance is far from satisfactory. We present the Seb-tree, a simple indexing scheme that supports temporal ranking queries much more efficiently. The Seb-tree answers a top-k query for any time instance t in the optimal number of I/Os in expectation, namely, N k O(logB B B) I/Os, where N is the size of the data set and B is the disk block size. The index has near-linear size (for constant and reasonable kmax values, where kmax is the maximum value for the possible values of the query parameter k), can be constructed in near-linear time, and also supports insertions and deletions without affecting its query performance guarantee. Most of all, the Seb-tree is <b>especially</b> <b>appealing</b> in practice <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its simplicity as it uses the B-tree as the only building block. Extensive experiments on a number of large data sets, show that the Seb-tree is more than an order of magnitude faster than the R-tree based indexes for temporal ranking queries...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that cancer cells are loaded with excess proteins. To survive this proteotoxic crisis cancer cells rely heavily on the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome system (UPS). Valosin containing protein (VCP) or p 97 has recently emerged as a central player of UPS. Moreover, p 97 inhibitors were shown to possess potent anti-cancer properties. Owing to the essential function of p 97, it can be assumed that general p 97 inhibition will be equally toxic to surrounding normal tissues. Interestingly, p 97 employs diverse sets of cofactors to govern distinct biological pathways. Thus understanding the p 97 -cofactor interaction in specific pathways may give us the ultimate edge by allowing us to abolish those cancer specific p 97 -cofactor interactions in our fight against cancer. This thesis explains novel function of two bonafide p 97 cofactors SPRTN and FAF 1 in DNA replication. Our discovery of a new human syndrome followed by its characterisation that monogenic and biallelic mutations in SPRTN leads to premature aging and juvenile hepatocellular carcinoma, have led us to identify the critical function of SPRTN in DNA replication. Our follow up work further revealed that SPRTN is a novel protease in humans and has the essential function in covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) repair. To this end, we have found that SPRTN proteolytically removes CHK 1 from chromatin, which is evolutionary conserved and vital for replication fork progression to preserve genomic integrity. Additionally, this thesis also explains a novel mechanism through which FAF 1 downregulation in cancer cells might promote genomic instability. Our data supports a model where the p 97 - FAF 1 complex binds to ubiquitinated CDT 1 and degrades it via the proteasome after CDT 1 mediated replication initiation, to prevent re-replication and genomic instability. The notion that high replication stress in some cancers can be utilised as an Achilles heel, led to the search for novel factors involved in DNA replication owing to its high therapeutic potential. Replication factors with enzymatic activities are <b>especially</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the relative ease of targeting them by small molecule inhibitors. This thesis thus highlights the great potential of the p 97 systems in our battle against cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{postulated}} {{characteristics of}} double-negative (DNG) materials [...] i. e., materials with simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability (ε < 0, μ < 0) [...] and recent attempts to realize those characteristics with synthetic metamaterials are briefly reviewed. Investigations into the causality of signal propagation in a DNG medium are then presented. Previous {{research in this}} topic is examined, and it is verified that a DNG medium must be dispersive {{in order to be}} causal. An accurate time-domain description of propagation in a DNG medium is shown to be elusive due to the presence of dispersion, though approximate solutions and recommendations for future analytical research are provided. The results of numerical investigations into this topic are then discussed, and the anticipated combination of causal signal transmission and a negative phase shift are observed in the numerical data. Potential applications of DNG metamaterials to antenna systems are then presented. A DNG shell is observed to reduce the intrinsic reactance sensed by an infinitesimal electric dipole, thereby increasing the dipole's radiated power. Analytical expressions for the fields in the dipole [...] DNG shell system are derived, and numerical results for a variety of DNG shell configurations are discussed. The presence of a DNG shell is shown to increase the dipole's radiated power by orders of magnitude in some cases. A circuit model of the dipole [...] DNG shell system is additionally presented and used to interpret the system's physical behavior. The scattering properties of nested metamaterial shells are then analyzed. Various layering combinations of DNG, double-positive (DPS) and single-negative (SNG) shells are observed to produce resonant scattering of an incident, fundamental radial transverse-magnetic (TMᵣ) wave. Reciprocity between the metamaterial configurations that exhibit TMᵣ scattering resonances and those shown to maximize the power radiated by the infinitesimal electric dipole is demonstrated. Several additional metamaterial configurations are shown to produce both resonant TMᵣ scattering and resonant dipole radiation. A resonant configuration with one epsilon-negative (ENG) shell is <b>especially</b> <b>appealing</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its manufacturability. The effects of a DNG layer on the creeping waves scattered by a small metal sphere are also discussed as a minor yet curious offshoot to the scattering analyses...|$|E
