A new method of transformation was applied which requires no intermediate callus formation. Inoculation at the point of embryo axis attachment with A. tumefaciens causes the proliferation of multiple shoots which later develop into whole plants. The Ac element was detected in R 0 plants by PCR and Southern blot hybridization. A transformation frequency of 24 % and 10 % was obtained when PZAC 1 and PZAC 1 /R vectors were used for inoculation, respectively. The element proved to be transmitted sexually to R 1 plants. The Ac element follows a Mendelian pattern of inheritance in R 1 plants;Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of soybean mitochondrial DNA was conducted. A collection of <b>germ</b> <b>plasms</b> containing accessions of three Glycine species: max, soja, and gracilis were analyzed. The Plant Introductions and cultivars used in the RFLP screen for cytoplasmic diversity were used in the construction of isocytoplasmic lines. The cytoplasm was transferred into 2 different nuclear backgrounds of cultivars Clark 63 and Harosoy 63. Based on maize mitochondrial cloned genes and a cosmid library of Phaseolus mitochondrial genomes, the <b>germ</b> <b>plasms</b> were grouped into 6 RFLP groups;The mitochondrial-based RFLP analysis was able to detect variability within the same chloroplast RFLP groups.

The results showed the diversity within the populations, as revealed by the level of polymorphism, ranged from 29 % to 76 % while genetic divergence between populations as shown by genetic distance ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 50. In terms of genetic divergence, two genetically distinct groups of GFP, namely the Papua GFP in one group and the remaining five GFP populations in the other, were identified.

40|$|In August 2006, {{bluetongue}} (BT) {{was notified}} in The Netherlands on several animal holdings. This was {{the onset of}} a rapidly spreading BT-epidemic in north-western Europe (latitude > 51 °N) that affected cattle and sheep holdings in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg. The outbreaks were caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8, which had not been identified in the European Union before. Bluetongue virus can be introduced into a free area by movement of infected ruminants, infected midges or by infected semen and embryos. In this study, information on animal movements or transfer of ruminant <b>germ</b> <b>plasms</b> (semen and embryos) into the Area of First Infection (AFI), which occurred {{before and during the}} onset of the epidemic, were investigated in order to establish the conditions for the introduction of this virus. All inbound transfers of domestic or wild ruminants, non-susceptible mammal species and ruminant <b>germ</b> <b>plasms</b> into the AFI during the high-risk period (HRP), registered by the Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) of the EC, were obtained. Imports originating from countries with a known or suspected history of BTV-incidence of any serotype were identified. The list of countries with a reported history of BTV incidence was obtained from the OIE Handistatus II for the period from 1996 until 2004. No ruminants were imported from a Member State (MS) with a known history of BTV- 8 or from any other country with a known or suspected history of BTV incidence of any serotype. Of all non-susceptible mammal species only 233 horses were transported directly into the AFI during the HRP. No importations of semen or embryos into the AFI were registered in TRACES during the period of interest. An obvious source for the introduction of BTV- 8, such as import of infected ruminants, could not be identified and the exact origin and route of the introduction of BTV- 8 thus far remains unknown. However, the absence of legal import of ruminants from outside the EU into the AFI and the absence of BTV- 8 in southern Europe suggest that, the introduction of the BTV- 8 infection into the north-western part of Europe took place via another route. Specifically, in relation to this, the potential for Culicoides to be imported along with or independently of the import of animals, plants or other `materials¿, and the effectiveness of measures to reduce such a possibility, merit further study...|$|R
25|$|August Weismann's idea, {{set out in}} his 1892 book Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance), {{was that}} the {{hereditary}} material, which he called the <b>germ</b> <b>plasm,</b> {{and the rest of}} the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'. He argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.|$|E
25|$|Lamarck {{is usually}} remembered for {{his belief in}} the {{inheritance}} of acquired characteristics, and the use and disuse model by which organisms developed their characteristics. Lamarck incorporated this belief into his theory of evolution, along with other more common beliefs of the time, such as spontaneous generation. The inheritance of acquired characteristics (also called the theory of adaptation or soft inheritance) was rejected by August Weismann in the 1880s when he developed a theory of inheritance in which <b>germ</b> <b>plasm</b> (the sex cells, later redefined as DNA), remained separate and distinct from the soma (the rest of the body); thus nothing which happens to the soma may be passed on with the germ-plasm. This model underlies the modern understanding of inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Critics of neo-Lamarckism {{pointed out}} {{that no one had}} ever {{produced}} solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist August Weismann resulted in the <b>germ</b> <b>plasm</b> theory of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired characteristics was impossible, since the Weismann barrier would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. This effectively polarised the argument between the Darwinians and the neo-Lamarckians, as it forced people to choose whether to agree or disagree with Weismann and hence with evolution by natural selection. Despite Weismann's criticism, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection {{at the end of the}} 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E

We studied this by isolating a β-amylase cDNA and by examining signals that affect its expression. The β-amylase cDNA encoded a 55. 95 -kD polypeptide with a deduced amino acid sequence showing high similarity to other plant β-amylases. Starch concentrations, β-amylase activities, and β-amylase mRNA levels were measured in roots of alfalfa after defoliation, in suspension-cultured cells incubated in sucrose-rich or -deprived media, and in roots of cold-acclimated <b>germ</b> <b>plasms.</b> Starch levels, β-amylase activities, and β-amylase transcripts were reduced significantly in roots of defoliated plants and in sucrose-deprived cell cultures. β-Amylase transcript was high in roots of intact plants but could not be detected 2 to 8 d after defoliation. β-Amylase transcript levels increased in roots between September and October and then declined 10 -fold in November and December after shoots were killed by frost. Alfalfa roots contain greater β-amylase transcript levels compared with roots of sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Southern analysis indicated that β-amylase is present as a multigene family in alfalfa. Our results show no clear association between β-amylase activity or transcript abundance and starch hydrolysis in alfalfa roots. The great abundance of β-amylase and its unexpected patterns of gene expression and protein accumulation support our current belief that this protein serves a storage function in roots of this perennial species...|$|R

We performed a laboratory investigation to evaluate the germination percent, germination speed and days to 50 % germination (T 50) of red rice seed three groups were selected: (1) four Southeast Asian varieties/germplasms, (2) six Korean varieties/germplasms with enhanced yield and (3) four Korean varieties/germplasms which are problem in direct-sown paddy fields. The selected varieties/germplasms were incubated at four different day/night temperature settings: 15 / 10, 20 / 15, 25 / 20 and 30 / 25 °C. This study {{has been carried out}} at phytotron and glass house between 2007 through 2009 to find out the characteristics of Asian redrice <b>germ</b> <b>plasms.</b> According to results, the germination percent and germination speed of red rice seed generally increased with increasing temperature. At low temperature (20 / 15 °C), red rice seeds, selected or imported red rice from cold areas, resulted in lowest germination percent (9 %) and germination speed (12. 3), however, T 50 was the lowest (7. 2 at 15 / 10 °C) compared to all the Southeast Asia red rice varieties/germplasms. Germination characteristics of Korean red rice seeds showed similar responses to temperature conditions depending on where they came from and local temperature: southern part of Korea (Hapcheon) or northern part (Suwon). However, Yeongcheon red rice showed high germination percent (96 - 100 %) and low T 50 (9. 0 - 2. 7) which was very similar to group 2 which were already selected as cultivars/germplasms for high vigor and high yield. The critical temperature for red rice germination related characteristics was 25 / 20 °C and activity (germination speed and T 50) did not increase much at 30 / 25 °C.

It just became clear that genomes of grasses have evolved in a manner analogous to Lego blocks. Large chromosome segments have been reshuffled and stuffer pieces added between genes. Although some genomes have become very large, the genome with the fewest stuffer pieces, the rice genome, is the Rosetta Stone of all the bigger grass genomes. This means that sequencing the rice genome as anchor genome of the grasses will provide instantaneous access to the same genes in the same relative physical position in other grasses (e. g., corn and wheat), without the need to sequence each of these genomes independently. (i) The sequencing of the entire genome of rice as anchor genome for the grasses will accelerate plant gene discovery in many important crops (e. g., corn, wheat, and rice) by several orders of magnitudes and reduce research and development costs for government and industry at a faster pace.

Because of its size, rice is only 12 % of the human or the corn genome, and technology improvements by the human genome project are completely transferable, translating in another 50 % reduction of the costs.

2500|$|Karl Pearson was {{important}} in {{the founding of the}} school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, [...] "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" [...] established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that <b>germ</b> <b>plasm</b> consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelian's favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.|$|E
