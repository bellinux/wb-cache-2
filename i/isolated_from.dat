40|$|Escherichia coli <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> septicemic or healthy {{chickens}} and turkeys from Quebec were serotyped, examined genotypically by using DNA probes specific for the pil and pap fimbrial {{systems and the}} aerobactin siderophore system, and examined phenotypically for lethality in day-old chicks, hemagglutination, serum resistance, and aerobactin production. Serogroups O 78 and O 1 were most common in septicemic {{chickens and}} turkeys. pap+ <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> chickens were associated with septicemia, and pap+ <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> turkeys were associated with lethality in day-old chicks. Four of nine pap+ <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> septicemic turkeys expressed P adhesin, whereas all pap+ <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> septicemic chickens were negative for P adhesin. The pil+ genotype was associated with septicemia in chickens and with serum resistance in <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> turkeys. Mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was associated with septicemia in chickens and turkeys, although this phenotype {{was not associated with}} pil+ <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> turkeys. Serum resistance was associated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> septicemic turkeys and with lethality in <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> chickens. The aerobactin system was associated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> septicemic chickens and turkeys. Overall, results indicated that (i) genotypic examination may reveal virulence-associated traits which differ from the typically expected phenotype and/or are not readily expressed in vitro, and (ii) certain phenotypic and genotypic traits associated with E. coli causing extraintestinal disease in humans and animals are also associated with E. coli causing avian septicemia...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} Campylobacter concisus in gastrointestinal disease {{has not been}} determined definitively. This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 39 C. concisus <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> Danish patients with diarrhoea, three <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> healthy individuals and the type strain. A cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) -like effect on Vero cells was observed in 35 (90 %) <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> patients with diarrhoea, in all three <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> healthy individuals and in the type strain. Analysis of SDS-PAGE protein profiles and PCR amplification of 23 S rDNA assigned the isolates into two distinct, but discordant groups. Automated ribotyping (RiboPrinting) identified 34 distinct patterns among the 43 isolates, but cluster analysis did not separate <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> patients with diarrhoea <b>from</b> <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> healthy patients. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis with three primers identified 37 unique profiles, but requires further evaluation. The <b>isolates</b> obtained <b>from</b> healthy carriers were distinguished by cluster analysis <b>from</b> the <b>isolates</b> obtained <b>from</b> patients with diarrhoea. All the isolates were susceptible to 11 antimicrobial agents tested. Overall, there was considerable variability between the C. concisus isolates, {{but there were no}} clear phenotypic or genotypic differences between <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> patients with diarrhoea and <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> healthy carriers. Further evidence is needed to support the possible role of C. concisus as a human enteric pathogen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{explored}} {{the relationships among}} genotypes, virulence and clinical forms of Sporothrix schenckii. Genomic DNA <b>from</b> <b>isolates</b> of S. schenckii, collected from different clinical forms of sporotrichosis, was amplified by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Suspensions of different isolates of S. schenckii were inoculated into healthy BALB/c mice to compare their virulence, and the numbers and distribution of spores were determined by histological analysis. RAPD analysis indicated that the <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> different clinical forms of sporotrichosis belonged to different genotypes. The mice inoculated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> disseminated sporotrichosis showed an earlier onset of illness and more severe lesions than those inoculated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, which, in turn, showed an earlier onset of illness and more severe lesions than those inoculated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis. Healthy BALB/c mice injected with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> disseminated sporotrichosis died within 10 days, whereas <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis failed to cause death. Histologically, mice inoculated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> disseminated sporotrichosis had more spores than those inoculated with <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis. Thus, different genotypes may be associated closely with the virulence of different clinical forms of S. schenckii infection...|$|R
40|$|Enterococcus faecalis is {{a leading}} cause of infections in liver {{transplant}} patients. This study reviewed the incidence of virulence factors such as hemolysin, gelatinase, aggregation substances (asa 1 and asa 373), or the enterococcal surface protein (Esp) in <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> liver transplant patients. In total, 133 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> liver transplant patients were compared with 47 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> feces of healthy volunteers and 66 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> blood cultures. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis indicates that the <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> different clinical subgroups can be divided into genogroups with an AFLP similarity of. > 80 % and different virulence factors. Hemolysin and asa 1 might be associated with infection, as they are more frequent in <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> blood cultures and transplant patients. Esp might be associated with colonization and spread, because it is more frequent in <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> feces of healthy volunteers and transplant patients.

All isolates were susceptible to apramycin, neomycin, and gentamicin. Only a few C. jejuni isolates were resistant {{to one or}} more {{antimicrobial agents}}. Resistance to tetracycline was more common among C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> humans (11 %) than among C. jejuni <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> animals (0 to 2 %).

A greater proportion of C. coli than of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to the other antimicrobial agents tested. Isolates were in most cases either coresistant to tylosin, spiramycin, and erythromycin or susceptible to all three antibiotics. More macrolide-resistant isolates were observed among C. coli <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> swine (79 %) than among C. coli <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> broilers (18 %) and humans (14 %). Twenty-four percent of C. coli <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> pigs were resistant to enrofloxacin, whereas 29 % of C. coli <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> humans and none from broilers were resistant.
