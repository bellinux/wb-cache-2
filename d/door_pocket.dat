50|$|A {{programme}} of life-extension refurbishment commenced in 2002. This involved {{adding new}} air-conditioning units, removing the original <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> {{windows of the}} steel bodied cars, and adding front-end skirts.|$|E
50|$|The 1500 series fleet {{was built}} between 1985 and 1991. The first five 4-car sets {{delivered}} had steel bodies, while all subsequent sets had aluminium bodies with <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> windows discontinued. Sets built from 1990 onward used VVVF control.|$|E
50|$|Kaiser was {{the first}} and only car {{manufacturer}} to feature <b>pocket</b> <b>doors,</b> although not all of their cars had <b>pocket</b> <b>doors.</b> To date, no other car has utilised <b>pocket</b> <b>doors.</b> Their unique <b>pocket</b> <b>doors</b> slide tidily into the front fender, which leaves the vehicle looking a lot more aesthetically pleasing than the doors sliding outside of the bodywork.|$|R
5000|$|Target 120 L 5-speed - Same as the 120 L, plus 5-speed gearbox, front <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> {{digital clock}} and stereo radio/cassette player.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} panel gained darker features and redesigned graphics for the gauges. To create more leg {{space in the}} cabin, a protrusion from the <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> was eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Nineteen 2-car sets (R1 to R19) were {{delivered}} to Takasaki Depot between November 1988 and February 1991 {{for use on}} Ryomo Line, Agatsuma Line, Joetsu Line, and Shinetsu Line local services. The livery is all-over cream with green and pink lining. Sets from R6 onwards have no <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> windows.|$|E
5000|$|... 7 x 2-car 20 kV AC 60 Hz {{sets were}} {{converted}} from former 475 series cars with new bodies from November 1986 at JNR's Kokura and Kagoshima factories {{for use in}} Kyushu. The body design of these sets was identical to the earlier 713 series, with two pairs of sliding doors on each side. Four sets (HK201 to HK204) were converted in fiscal 1986, and three more sets (HK205 to HK207) were converted in fiscal 1987. [...] The latter batch differed in having no <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> windows.|$|E
50|$|In {{other efforts}} to help keep {{residents}} safe, mitigate liability, and protect reputations, Long Term Care and Assisted Living Facilities may use radio frequency (RFID) products to protect their residents. A resident wears a wrist, pendant, or ankle transmitter. This RFID tag can be read by receiving antenna units, which are placed usually at door or hallway locations that are deemed likely routes of egress and need monitoring. The system will then either sound an alarm or briefly lock a door when a door monitor reads a transmitter worn by a resident that is at risk for wandering. This helps prevent an elopement as staff can be notified by alarms at the <b>door,</b> <b>pocket</b> pagers, and email. A caregiver {{will be able to}} quickly find the person at risk and keep them safely inside. Smaller scale versions of this technology are also used in private residences.|$|E
5000|$|... 120 LS / 120 GLS - Both had front <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> tachometer, {{and since}} 1984: 5-speed gearbox, digital clock and stereo radio/cassette player. Only the 120 GLS could be ordered with sunroof.|$|R
25|$|November 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette GL {{with sports}} wheels with 175 x 70 SR tyres, bumper over riders, and higher {{equipment}} level including new centre console, front <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> and velour interior door panels.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2000, the Twingo {{underwent}} {{its second}} major restyling. Additions included larger 14" [...] wheels, revised door trims with larger <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> a black trunk-opener lever (instead of shiny silver) and cup holders {{in front of}} the gearstick.|$|R
5000|$|The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), 340 {{of which}} were {{produced}} from August 1987 to September 1989, is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera that, with engine and suspension modifications, was purpose built for club racing. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two unit), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid [...] "Carrera" [...] logo, all {{in order to save}} an estimated 70 kg in weight. With the exception of CSs delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the [...] "CS Club Sport" [...] decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS's did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all CS's have a [...] "SP" [...] stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK CS's were all [...] "Grand Prix White" [...] with a red [...] "Carrera CS" [...] decal {{on each side of the}} car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the stock 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper {{was sentenced}} to four {{years in prison for}} depriving {{multiple}} motorists of their civil rights, U.S. Attorney José Angel Moreno and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas E. Perez announced. Michael Anthony Higgins (March 3, 1967 - April 29, 2010), 42, formerly of the Corpus Christi area, was found guilty on January 13, 2010, by a jury’s verdict on all four counts of the indictment of willfully stealing money from motorists he stopped on the highway while working as a trooper. In addition to the four-year prison term, U.S. District Judge John D. Rainey ordered Higgins to pay $850 restitution, representing the money he took from the motorists, and will serve a one-year term of supervised release following completion of his prison term. Upon motion of the government, Judge Rainey ordered Higgins, previously released on bond, to be immediately remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Higgins was prosecuted for stopping motorists who appeared to be of Hispanic descent and stealing their money, usually in amounts of several hundred dollars. As a result of the civilian complaints, DPS, in conjunction with the Texas Rangers, initiated an undercover operation to investigate Higgins. An undercover police officer posed as a civilian of Hispanic descent with limited English language ability and was issued several pre-recorded $100 bills. While being monitored by DPS aerial surveillance, the undercover officer drove past Higgins' duty area in Kleberg County and was eventually stopped by Higgins. Upon making the traffic stop, Higgins asked the undercover officer for money in his possession and then took the money behind the passenger side door of his police cruiser. After Higgins returned bills to the officer, the officer realized that some of the money was missing. Texas Rangers and DPS officers confronted Higgins and, upon inspection of the police cruiser, found two of the pre-recorded $100 bills secreted in the passenger side <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> which was next to the area where Higgins had gone to count the money. The case was investigated by the FBI, Texas Rangers, and Officers of the Texas DPS. The case was being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruben Perez of the U.S. Attorney Office for the Southern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Jim Felte from the Civil Rights Division. Not long after being sentenced, Higgins died on April 29, 2010 at the age of 42 while incarcerated in the Coastal Bend Detention Center in Robstown, Texas. Complaining of chest pains the night before, Higgins collapsed and CPR was performed before he was transported by emergency medical services to Calallen Hospital, where he later died. He was pronounced dead at 7:32 a.m.|$|E
50|$|Edward Robinson is a {{young man}} firmly under the thumb of his fiancée, Maud, who does not wish to rush into {{marriage}} until his prospects and income improve. He is a romantic at heart who wishes he was masterful and rugged like the men he reads of in novels. Somewhat impetuous in nature, he enters a competition and wins the first prize of £500. He doesn't tell Maud of this, knowing she will insist the money is wisely invested for the future, and instead uses it to buy a small two-seater car. On Christmas Eve, on holiday from his work as a clerk, he goes for a drive into the country. Stopping off in the dark evening at the Devil's Punch Bowl, he gets out of his car to admire the view and takes a short walk. He returns to his vehicle and drives back to London but on the way, reaching into the <b>door</b> <b>pocket</b> for his muffler, he instead finds a diamond necklace. In shock, he realises that although it is the same model car as his, it is not the same car. By coincidence, he got into the wrong car after his walk and drove off. He returns to the Punch Bowl but his car has gone. Searching further, he finds a note in the car he is driving which gives instructions to meet someone at a local village at ten o'clock. He keeps the assignation and meets a beautiful woman in evening dress and cloak who thinks he is someone called Gerald. Telling her his name is Edward, she is not thrown by the mistake and in conversation reveals that 'Gerald's' brother is called Edward but she hasn't seen him since she was six years old. She gets in the car but realises quickly that Edward has only recently learnt to drive and takes the wheel herself. She tells Edward a story about her and 'Jimmy' having successfully stolen the necklace from a rich lady called Agnes Larella. She drives him to a London townhouse where the butler arranges evening dress for him and the lady drives them onto Ritson's - the nightclub of the rich and famous. He drinks cocktails and dances with the lady who he discovers is Lady Noreen Elliot, a famous society debutante and the theft of the necklace was in fact an elaboration of a treasure hunt, the rule being that the 'stolen' item must be worn in public for one hour to claim the prize. As Edward and Lady Noreen leave the nightclub, the real Gerald turns up in Edward's car and also reveals Edward not to be the one Noreen thought he was. Edward hurriedly retrieves his car and is about to drive off when Noreen begs him to 'be a sport' and give her the necklace so she can return it. He does so and receives a passionate kiss in return.|$|E
25|$|September 1979 - Revisions: {{all models}} fitted with {{flush-fitting}} headlights, restyled seats, front <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> additional fascia vents, new badging and rear fog lights. Protective side mouldings on GL models. Optional three-speed automatic transmission available on L and GL models.|$|R
50|$|Since the RS/RS America was {{intended}} as a no-frills, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a limited-slip differential, AM/FM cassette stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Conceptualised by AGMC, {{the sole}} dealers of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in Dubai, Sharjah and the Northern Emirates of the UAE, it is {{a version of}} Ghost with Brooklands Green and Desert Dune body colours, tri-colour {{interior}} leather upholstery in Crème Light, Pine Green and Hotspur Red accented by contrast stitching and seat piping; Lambswool floor mats, a starlight headliner, Bespoke picnic tables, <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> lined with tartan and cross-banded Mahogany veneers using Persimmon wood, a pine green steering wheel, personalised tread plates.|$|R
50|$|As before, the {{interior}} lighting uses only long-lasting, energy-saving LED technology. With 64 colours, the optionally extended ambience lighting offers {{a wealth of}} individual settings. It adds lighting highlights, for example, on the trim elements, the central display, the stowage facility {{at the front of}} the centre console, the handle recesses, the <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> in the front and rear footwells, on the overhead control panel, and on the tweeters when the vehicle is equipped with the Burmester® High-End 3D Surround Sound System.|$|R
5000|$|A {{choice of}} two {{transmissions}} were offered a 6-speed manual and 4-speed automatic. Front and side airbags, climate control air-conditioning and traction control {{are some of}} the features that come as standard. By activating a certain button in the cabin labelled [...] "power" [...] the automatic transmission holds the gears in longer, this gives the car more acceleration power. Storage wise the cabin offers, pockets behind the seats, <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> a large glove box and a console bin plus the larger boot.|$|R
5000|$|The MG [...] "Y" [...] Type had an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} interior furnishing and finish, {{in accordance with the}} best British traditions. The facing surfaces of all seats were leather, as were the <b>door</b> <b>pockets.</b> The rear of the front seats were made from Rexine, a form of leathercloth, which matched the leather fronts, as were the door panels themselves. A roller blind was fitted to the rear window as an anti-glare mechanism (not a privacy screen as many think).|$|R
500|$|Additional detail touches {{were added}} to the VE, such as a new four-strut hinge system for the boot to replace space intrusive, much {{maligned}} [...] "gooseneck" [...] hinges as used on previous Commodores. High-specification variants see expandable <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> and a Saab-like [...] "blackout" [...] feature which illuminates only the speedometer at night to enhance driver focus on the road. An innovative flush-fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical centre console means the lever can be easily reversed to sit {{on the opposite side of}} console for left-hand drive export markets, minimising redesign costs.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a {{car with}} doors that closed with the convincing clunk of a railway carriage, {{interiors}} trimmed with wood and leather, and an instrument panel with clear clock-faces. It had furnishings that looked like those in a doctor’s sitting room or even a consulting room, door cappings with fine inlays, and <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> with leather flaps like giant tobacco pouches. The Doctor’s Coupé {{was a car}} for strong men in tweed plus-fours who preferred things built to last." [...] - Eric Dymock, Rover: The First Ninety Years 1904-1994.|$|R

50|$|The Standards also {{introduced}} the rollsign to the New York City Subway, an innovation {{that would be}} repeated on many other rolling stock orders. Older cars had metal signs {{which had to be}} physically removed and replaced to change. Rollsigns simplified the process by allowing train crews to update the sign's display by merely turning a hand crank (which would later be replaced with an allen wrench to prevent tampering in later rolling stock). Early Standards (cars 2000-2499) had the rollsigns installed in the windows behind side <b>door</b> <b>pockets,</b> while later Standards placed them in the upper half of side windows for better visibility.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> is {{a sliding}} door that slides along its length and disappears, when open, into a {{compartment}} {{in the adjacent}} wall, or as in terms of vehicles, into the vehicle's bodywork. <b>Pocket</b> <b>doors</b> were used in some vans, including Renault Estafette and Morris J4 and train carriages such as the London Underground 1973 Stock, but rarely in cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} walls are constructed of beaverboard; the kitchen walls, now covered by paneling, are encased in sheet metal. Several rooms have pressed tin ceilings. All {{of the interior}} trim is oak, as is much of the tongue-and-groove flooring. One striking feature is a beveled glass door to the closet opposite the bathroom <b>door.</b> There are <b>pocket</b> <b>doors</b> between {{the dining room and}} the front bedroom.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1967, {{a number}} of {{additional}} changes were incorporated to accommodate stricter safety regulations and US emission laws. The safety improvements included a collapsible steering wheel and padded wheel hub, concave control knobs, elastic black rubber heater levers (instead of rigid colored translucent plastic), and softer, rounded dash top padding. Door handles, locks, and window cranks were modernized and less protruding, the <b>door</b> <b>pockets</b> were elastic, the rear-view mirror frame was chrome instead of black plastic, and the side view mirrors became more angular. Essentially, the 1967 250 SL retained the more classic [...] "chrome" [...] interior of the 230 SL, whereas the 1968 250 SL introduced the modernized [...] "safety" [...] interior of the 280 SL.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972: Introduction of the Maxi 1750 HL, {{with twin}} SU HS6 {{carburettor}} {{version of the}} 1748 cc engine, which gave a higher output of [...] at 5250 rpm.

5000|$|At {{the main}} entrance, an oak paneled door with {{original}} beveled glass opens {{into a wide}} center hallway, floored in wide oak strips, with a large oak staircase. A paneled door on the north leads to a small parlor, with large double <b>pocket</b> <b>doors</b> leading to a larger parlor and another small single <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> opening into a large mourning room. In both of these rooms the oak strips on the floor are arranged in a pattern of [...] rectangles. A double <b>pocket</b> <b>door</b> separates them. On the south wall of the parlor is a brick fireplace, built later, with original wooden mantelpiece. The windows have heavy oak trim, raised panels beneath them and a beveled-edge mirror between the two on the west wall.|$|R
