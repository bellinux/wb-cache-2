40|$|It is {{accepted}} that {{the efficiency of}} sugar cane clarification is closely linked with sugar juice composition (including suspended or insoluble impurities), the inorganic phosphate content, the liming condition and type, and the interactions between the juice components. These interactions are not well understood, particularly those between calcium, phosphate, and sucrose in sugar cane juice. Studies have been conducted on calcium oxide (CaO) /phosphate/sucrose systems in both synthetic and factory juices to provide further information on the defecation process (i. e., simple liming to effect impurity removal) and to identify an effective clarification process {{that would result in}} reduced scaling of sugar factory <b>evaporators,</b> <b>pans,</b> and centrifugals. Results have shown that a two-stage process involving the addition of lime saccharate to a set juice pH followed by the addition of sodium hydroxide to a final juice pH or a similar two-stage process where the order of addition of the alkalis is reversed prior to clarification reduces the impurity loading of the clarified juice compared to that of the clarified juice obtained by the conventional defecation process. The treatment process showed reductions in CaO (27 % to 50 %) and MgO (up to 20 %) in clarified juices with no apparent loss in juice clarity or increase in residence time of the mud particles compared to those in the conventional process. There was also a reduction in the SiO 2 content. However, the disadvantage of this process is the significant increase in the Na 2 O content...|$|R

40|$|LOW WORLD sugar {{prices are}} making it {{increasingly}} difficult for raw sugar mills to remain competitive, and many milling companies are embarking on new revenue earning opportunities. In almost all new ventures, the energy from bagasse (as steam or cogenerated electricity) or the fibre itself provides an important basis for generating the additional revenue. Integral to increasing the economic viability of such projects {{is the need to}} cost-effectively reduce the steam consumed by the factory for sugar manufacture. The Sugar Research Institute has completed a comprehensive study of numerous options to reduce the process steam consumption of factories, and to determine the financial implications of the different options. Process simulation software for <b>evaporators,</b> <b>pans</b> and heaters were integrated with a basic high pressure steam model. For each process steam efficiency option, the effects on boiler load, fuel consumption, and cogeneration output could be accurately assessed for selected steam conditions at the boiler. The outputs from the integrated process model were directly linked to the financial model. For nominated input conditions, the project determined a prioritised list of technically and economically attractive options for reducing the steam consumption of the factory. The analyses were undertaken for three scenarios which include sale of export electricity, sale of surplus steam or sale of surplus bagasse. This paper describes the development of the integrated models and the results for a base case study. The results show a quintuple station is the preferred evaporator configuration for circumstances where the steam on cane is reduced from current levels of approximately 50 % on cane to about 40 %. To reduce the steam consumption below this level, a sextuple arrangement is preferred. A quadruple set shows inferior results for all steam on cane values. Options for steam on cane to below 30 % were found to be technically feasible for cane factories, but these configurations {{are not likely to be}} economically justified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Traditional salt {{farming in}} Goa, India has been practised {{for the past}} 1, 500 [*]years by a few communities. Goa’s {{riverine}} estuaries, easy access to sea water and favourable climatic conditions makes salt production attractive during summer. Salt produced through this natural evaporation process also {{played an important role}} in the economy of Goa even during the Portuguese rule as salt was the chief export commodity. In the past there were 36 villages involved in salt production, which is now reduced to 9. Low income, lack of skilled labour, competition from industrially produced salt, losses incurred on the yearly damage of embankments are the major reasons responsible for the reduction in the number of salt pans. Salt pans (Mithagar or Mithache agor) form a part of the reclaimed waterlogged khazan lands, which are also utilised for aquaculture, pisciculture and agriculture. Salt pans in Goa experience three phases namely, the ceased phase during monsoon period of June to October, preparatory phase from December to January, and salt harvesting phase, from February to June. After the monsoons, the salt pans are prepared manually for salt production. During high tide, an influx of sea water occurs, which enters the reservoir pans through sluice gates. The sea water after 1 – 2 [*]days on attaining a salinity of approximately 5 ºBé, is released into the <b>evaporator</b> <b>pans</b> and kept till it attains a salinity of 23 - 25 ºBé. The brine is then released to crystallizer pans, where the salt crystallises out 25 - 27 ºBé and is then harvested. Salt pans form a unique ecosystem where succession of different organisms with varying environmental conditions occurs. Organisms ranging from bacteria, archaea to fungi, algae, etc., are known to colonise salt pans and may influence the quality of salt produced. The aim of this review is to describe salt farming in Goa’s history, importance of salt production as a community activity, traditional method of salt production and the biota associated with salt pans. </p...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and condensation of steam within the steam belt and the steam chest surrounding the calandria tubes of vacuum <b>pans</b> and <b>evaporators</b> were investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modelling techniques. The flow of steam in <b>evaporators</b> and vacuum <b>pans</b> is an aspect that is not usually given much attention but it can influence the productivity of these vessels. The latent heat of the steam provides the heat to the juice or massecuite which induces the formation of vapour bubbles and drives the circulation of the fluid within the vessel. Strong and uniform circulation of the massecuite in vacuum pans increases the production capacity and improves {{the quality of the}} sugar produced. Non-uniform heating by the steam {{on the outside of the}} calandria tubes can contribute to uneven and inconsistent {{heat transfer}} to the juice or massecuite within the vessel. As a consequence under these circumstances the installed heating surface is not effectively utilised. Inconsistent heating can affect the performance of vacuum pans since it influences the circulation of massecuite and the crystallisation rate of sugar. The CFD modelling investigation into the steam side operation of the calandria of vacuum <b>pans</b> and <b>evaporators</b> was preliminary in nature but has shown promising results. The results of the CFD simulations were compared against measured data to determine the applicability of the CFD model. The condensation physics of the CFD model currently has limitations, yet despite these, the CFD model has identified some deficiencies in the flow of steam within the calandria. The investigations into different geometries for steam flow into <b>evaporators</b> and vacuum <b>pans</b> and the results of CFD simulations are detailed and discussed. Some of the proposed modifications resulted in predicted improvements to the distribution of steam within the calandria...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{process of}} {{evaporation}} {{from the lake}} sur-face {{is one of the}} main mechanisms in the energy and water budgets of the lake hydrologic cycle, and an essential component of the water balance especially for inland lakes. In this study, using routine meteorological data as input, a one-layer potential evaporation model was employed to simulate evaporation and energy fluxes over Lake Yam-drok Yumco, the largest high-elevation inland lake in the mountain area of the Tibet-Himalaya in China. Then, the calculation results were compared with the measured val-ues from a big <b>pan</b> <b>evaporator</b> of 20 m 2 near the lake. The results show that the average annual input radiation flux R; is 128. 2 W m- 2, the lake storage heat flux G is 19. 4 W m- 2, the sensible heat flux H is 20. 4 W m- 2 and the latent heat flux lE is 107. 8 W m- 2. The R; and G exhibit similar seasonal variations. The lE reaches a maximum in October, lagging nearly 4 months behind the R; and the G, which indicates the large heat capacity of the lake. The simulated annual evaporation ranges from 1, 113. 2 to 1, 429. 1 mm and its mean value is 1, 252. 5 mm during 1961 – 2005. The simulated annual evaporation is in good agreement with the measured value, and the measured average lake temperature is as expected when compared with the measured lake surface temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} coefficients of free water surface evaporation were investigated. Comparisons were made between numerous evaporation tanks (pans) and a 20 m(2) evaporation tank. Based on 6 years of evaporation data collected at Nansihu Lake Evaporation Station in Shandong Province, China, the following {{results have been}} obtained. First, {{conversion coefficients}} varied according to the evaporator type. The average yearly conversion coefficient was only 0. 60 for phi 20 <b>evaporator</b> (an evaporation <b>pan</b> with a diameter of 20 cm), whereas it was about 1. 07 for the E 601 's pan, whose rim was about 7. 5 cm above ground. Second, the conversion coefficient changes within a year had the same pattern among the evaporators evaluated. The monthly conversion coefficients had the minimum values in March or April, then increased with time, and reached their maximum values in August or September. After September, the conversion coefficients varied in different directions with time. Third, the conversion coefficients changed from year to year, but their variations between maximum and minimum values were between 0. 06 and 0. 16. Fourth, the installation modes, structures, and composition of the evaporators affected the evaporation amount. Fifth, the conversion coefficients at Nansihu and Yucheng stations for the same evaporator did not show a distinct difference. The E 601 evaporator has almost the same conversion coefficients at six of seven stations spanning almost 20 degrees in latitude from northern to southern China. Sixth, the yearly evaporation from a 100 m(2) evaporation tank was almost {{the same as that}} from the 20 m(2) evaporation tanks; however, the differences still existed in any given month.

30|$|In {{the year}} of 2014 – 15 {{sugarcane}} has been planted in 5.03 million hectares area by India (ISMA 2015). Indian sugar consumption is forecast to rise to 27 million metric tons in 2014 – 15, because of continued strong domestic demand (Aradhey 2015). Sugar industry has {{a significant impact on}} country’s economic development. The industries have also major contribution in increasing the water pollution (Saranraj and Stella 2014). Sugar industry wastewaters are produced mainly by cleaning operations. Washing of milling house floor, various division of boiling house like <b>evaporators,</b> clarifiers, vacuum <b>pans,</b> centrifugation, etc., generates huge volume of wastewater. Also, wash water used for filter cloth of rotary vacuum filter and periodical cleaning of lime water and SO 2 producing house becomes a part of wastewater (Kushwaha 2013). The elemental pollutant present in the sugar industry effluents are phosphates, nitrogen in the form of nitrates, various volatile solids, high TDS and suspended solids, various organic pollutants with high COD level (Tripathi et al. 2014). In proper treatment of wastewater bring unpleasant odors, effect on flora, fauna and human health (Sahu and Chaudhari 2015). Although all the industries function under the strict guidelines of the Pollution Control Agencies of the country, the environmental pollution situation is far from satisfactory especially in poor and developing countries. Different norms and guidelines are given for all the industries depending upon their pollution creating aspects (Gupta and Garg 2014). Most of the major industries have treatment facilities for industrial effluents. The treatment efficiency depends upon process and technique adopted according to pollution level (Yadav et al. 2014). Some methods have been already introduced to treat the waste water by using the metals, salts and oxide or combinations of iron, aluminium copper, etc. (Shivayogimath and Jahagirdar 2013). Among them iron is cheap, easily available and mostly used in water and wastewater treatment (Genther and Beede 2013; Upadhyay and Mistry 2012) in coagulation process (Farajnezhad and Gharbani 2012), electrocoagulation process (Ulucan et al. 2014) and in thermal treatment as catalyst (Verma et al. 2011). In the literature electrocoagulation and thermolysis is more popular among environmentalists to treat the different industrial wastewater like pulp and paper waste water (Mahesh et al. 2006), textile waste water (Essadki et al. 2008), drugs waste water (Deshpande and Satyanarayan 2011), petroleum industry (Verma et al. 2011), etc. The main aim of research work is to examine the performance of iron metal and salt for the treatment of sugar industry wastewater water treatment. The studies focus on effects of initial pH, massloading and working temperature on removal efficiency. Generated sludge has been analyzed with settling, filtration FTIR and scanning electron micrograph.|$|R
