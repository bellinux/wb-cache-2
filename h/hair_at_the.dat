That same year, Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert ended its 2001 City Center {{season with a}} production of Hair starring Luther Creek, Idina Menzel and Tom Plotkin, and featuring Hair composer Galt MacDermot on stage playing the keyboards. An Actors' Fund benefit of the show was performed for onenight at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 2004. The Tribe included Shoshana Bean, Raul Esparza, Jim J.

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E

5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
25|$|Laura Webb, 46, {{worked at}} the salon and was doing her mother's <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the incident; her mother, Hattie Stretz, 73, was shot and {{critically}} injured.|$|E
25|$|On the scalp, {{the hair}} is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost.|$|E

25|$|Classic male-pattern {{hair loss}} begins above the temples and vertex (calvaria) of the scalp. As it progresses, a rim of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sides and {{rear of the}} head remains. This has been {{referred}} to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. The Hamilton-Norwood scale has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males.|$|E
25|$|At {{one end of}} the Great Ball Court is the North Temple, {{also known}} as the Temple of the Bearded Man (Templo del Hombre Barbado).

50|$|The {{inflorescence}} bears dense {{clusters of}} tubular pink flowers each about a centimeter long. The {{mouth of the}} flower has hairs along the floor and a tuft of <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tip of the staminode.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} 2-5 cm tall, and caespitose. The flower stems are glabrous. The leaves have stellate {{hairs on the}} surface and simple <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> margins. The flowers are pure white, and many flowers on each stem.|$|R
25|$|Immediate {{preparation}} for a mikveh includes a bath or shower wherein {{every part of the}} body (including the ears and underneath the nails) is thoroughly washed; plus other routine hygiene practices which include trimming fingernails and toenails, brushing and flossing the teeth, and combing the <b>hair.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> mikvah itself, a female attendant is present to make certain that the woman immerses herself fully, including her hairs. Though that is the attendant's foremost duty, she may also help by checking a woman's back or answer questions regarding proper ritual protocol.|$|E
25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect cattle: S. bovifelis, S. bovihominis (S. hominis) S. cruzi (S. bovicanis) and S. hirsuta. S. cruzi is {{the only}} species known to be pathogenic in cattle. A number of clinical syndromes {{have been reported in}} connection with this parasite: eosinophilic myositis; abortions, stillbirths and deaths in pregnant cows; two cases of necrotic encephalitis in heifers have also been reported. Typical clinical signs of acute bovine sarcocystosis are: anorexia, pyrexia (42C or more), anemia, cachexia, enlarged palpable lymph nodes, excessive salivation and loss of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tip of the tail.|$|E
25|$|In September her costume {{became a}} focal point for angles as Saeed became a more regular in-ring performer. On September 4's Impact! ODB pinned her and then chased her backstage, coming out later with the burqa. Kong hit ODB {{in the back of the}} head while Saeed ran to reclaim her attire, her face masked by her <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Later that month Roxxi used a burqa to {{disguise}} herself as Saeed while Kong was facing newcomer Mercedes Steele. After the match Roxxi removed her disguise and attacked Kong with a steel chair, while Saeed appeared at the top of the entrance ramp bound in ropes (implying that she had been abducted by Roxxi prior to the match). Kong took revenge, pinning Roxxi in a tag effort also involving Saeed and Wilde, respectively, but Roxxi would make a return pin on Saeed in a singles match weeks later.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 100 mm. Adult males have blue-green forewings and white hindwings. They {{have a set}} of brown <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the wings that emit a pheromone. Females have brownish-green forewings and yellow hindwings.|$|R

50|$|The Ningbing false antechinus {{is similar}} to the fat-tailed false antechinus (Pseudantechinus macdonnellensis) but the females have four and not six teats. It also has a longer tail, with long <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base and the {{remainder}} slightly scaly in appearance.|$|R
25|$|The body of 28-year-old Lisa Nichols, {{who also}} used the last name of Jarvis, was found on September 16, 1984 along Interstate 40 near West Memphis, Arkansas. She was a {{resident}} of West Virginia and authorities {{were not able to}} come into contact with family members for some time, indicating she was estranged from them, resulting in her remaining unidentified for nearly a year. Her body was not identified until June 1985, nine months after she was strangled and left wearing only a sweater. Nichols is believed {{to be a part of}} the Redhead Murders, as she was found along a highway and had strawberry-blond <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of her demise. Her remains were identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to hitchhike.|$|E
25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> temples being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from behind the ears to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may be a point on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the cheek bone towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere on the cheek and one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E
500|$|Michael Butler {{produced}} <b>Hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> MET Theatre in Los Angeles from September 14 through December 30, 2007.

500|$|For threenights in September 2007, Joe's Pub and the Public Theater {{presented}} a 40th anniversary production of <b>Hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Delacorte Theater in Central Park. [...] This concert version, directed by Diane Paulus, featured Jonathan Groff as Claude and Galt MacDermot on stage on the keyboards. [...] The cast also included Karen Olivo as Sheila and Will Swenson as Berger. [...] Actors {{from the original}} Broadway production joined the cast on stage during the encore of [...] "Let the Sun Shine In." [...] Demand for the show was overwhelming, as long lines and overnight waits for tickets far exceeded that for other Delacorte productions such as Mother Courage and Her Children starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{reported}} that the work was simply a display of one's love for their country and an expression of joy at Singapore's success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be [...] "treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon". When interviewed by The New Paper, he said [...] "I know as a citizen {{that we are not}} allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist." [...] He also complained about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a national flag made of <b>hair</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Lee felt the use of hair to create the nation's flag meant that the flag was in the wrong colours, and was distasteful.|$|E

Caren Lyn Manuel played Sheila, and Christopher J. Hanke replaced Groff as Claude on August 17. Reviews were generally positive, with Ben Brantley of The New York Times writing that [...] "this production establishes the show {{as more than a}} vivacious period piece. Hair, it seems, has deeper roots than anyone remembered". [...] Time magazine wrote: [...] "Hair... has been reinvigorated and reclaimed {{as one of the great}} milestones in musical-theatre history. ... Today Hair seems, if anything, more daring than ever." ...|$|E
50|$|Sabino {{patterning}} {{usually is}} expressed with high white legs markings with white sometimes extending onto the belly, face, and chin; sabinos often lack <b>the</b> white <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{base of the}} tail that characterize rabicano.
