2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate groove wall, each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel and the outer wall carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic <b>disk</b> <b>recording,</b> on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. During playback, the movement of a single stylus tracking the groove is sensed independently, e.g., by two coils, each mounted diagonally opposite the relevant groove wall.|$|E

50|$|As {{hard disk}} {{capacities}} and computer CPU speeds increased {{at the end}} of the 1990s, hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> became more popular. As of early 2005 hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> takes two forms. One is the use of standard desktop or laptop computers, with adapters for encoding audio into two or many tracks of digital audio. These adapters can either be in-the-box soundcards or external devices, either connecting to in-box interface cards or connecting to the computer via USB or Firewire cables. The other common form of hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> uses a dedicated recorder which contains analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as one or two removable hard drives for data storage. Such recorders, packing 24 tracks in a few units of rack space, are actually single-purpose computers, which can in turn be connected to standard computers for editing.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic {{recording}} media: VHS tapes {{contain a}} reel of magnetic tape. The information {{that makes up}} the video and sound is encoded on the magnetic coating on the tape.
