Previous reports {{were concerned with}} the addition of 15 wt% EXT, or less, on the physical characteristics of the blend and on the development of optical texture following carbonization. Two additional blends of ECTP and EXT were prepared at the 30 and 50 wt% EXT content using a procedure already described. The characteristics of the blends are presented. The density for these blended materials is not much different than the density for the blends reported earlier. The softening point temperature for the 30 wt% EXT increased to over 200 C while the softening point temperature for the 50 wt% EXT blend was too high to be determined by the Mettler method. Coke yields approximately follow the law of mixtures. The optical texture of the <b>green</b> <b>cokes</b> for the 30 and 50 wt% EXT blends is shown. Though the optical texture of the <b>green</b> <b>cokes</b> was not significantly affected where the level of EXT is 15 wt% or less, larger proportions of EXT exert a marked reduction in anisotropy. The co-processing of coal with petroleum residues or other heavy hydrocarbons at elevated temperature and pressure has received considerable attention in the research community as a means to upgrade simultaneously coal and byproducts. Heavy hydrocarbons can function as sources of hydrogen, as well as performing as a medium for dissolution and dispersion of coal fragments. However, the focus of much of the prior research has been on developing fuels, distillable liquids, or synthetic crudes. Comparatively little effort has been deliberately directed toward the production of heavier, non-distillable materials which could perform as binder and extender pitches, impregnants, or feedstocks for cokes and other carbons...|$|R

An increase in the catalyst content of the coke shows a substantial detrimental affect on the overall anisotropy of the carbon microstructure. The catalyst (with a particle size distribution between 0. 5 µm and 78 µm) was found to present a physical barrier around which the anisotropic flow domains formed. At higher catalyst concentrations the catalyst dominates the carbon microstructure; however, there is still evidence of flow patterns albeit with a shorter range. XRD powder data and Raman spectroscopy provide evidence of multiphase graphitisation in both the calcined coke and pre-graphite. The crystal development of the calcined coke is dominated by catalytic graphitisation and that of the pre-graphite showed a greater dependence on thermal graphitisation.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} mesophase from different pitches under carbonisation conditions was investigated. Members of the pyrolysis series were prepared from four pitches. A temperature range between 380 and 500 °C was used to follow mesophase development for each pitch. As-received pitches and their <b>green</b> <b>cokes</b> were characterised by thermomechanical analysis (glass transition temperature and softening point temperature), elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry or differential thermogravimetry, and optical microscopy (mesophase content). Additional data about the evolution of different volatile products and about possible chemical reactions occurring during thermal decomposition were obtained from thermogravimetric mass spectrometric analysis. The effect of heating rate on the behaviour and carbon yield was also studied. The {{results showed that the}} two anthracene oil pitches do not develop mesophase, whereas the medium-temperature and high-temperature pitches do. However, their textures are completely different. The medium-temperature pitch shows an improvement in texture from the mosaic to the coarse domain at 500 °C, whereas the high-temperature pitch shows flow domains. It was further shown that the process of preparing mesophase, i. e. the heat-treatment process, increases the aromaticity and carbon yield. Thermogravimetric mass spectrometric analysis showed that the dominant reaction for all the pitches is the condensation reaction, which is accompanied by the evolution of H 2 and CO. The heating rate affects the behaviour of the pyrolysing pitches in that a lower heating rate lowers the carbon yield.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{rates of}} petroleum coke, char, and residual oil were measured in molten sodium phosphate. Both oxygen and steam {{were used as}} oxidants, {{and a variety of}} reactor configurations were studied. Reactors consisted of fused ceramic parts sealed into a reactor configuration using castable refractory. The reaction rate of carbon particles in a bubbling molten phosphate slurry was found to depend upon the rate of particle-bubble contacting. Upon contact, direct conversion of carbon particles with the gas phase occurs due to the large carbon-molten sodium phosphate contact angle (136 °). The potential flow solution for flow around a bubble where particles are assumed to follow the streamlines gave a consistent picture of bubble-particle contacting. The reactivity of the carbon in the bulk liquid was found to be negligible due to the low solubility of oxygen in the melt. Gas phase (no salt) results were generated to establish base cases and to examine treatment effects on the reactivity of green sponge and <b>green</b> needle <b>cokes.</b> The reactivities of both were favorably affected by toluene extraction and adversely affected by calcination to 1300 K. Extraction decreased the agglomerating nature of the sponge coke. Both extracts were largely aromatic with the needle coke extract being more so. Molten sodium phosphate was found to catalyze the gasification of petroleum coke by steam and by oxygen. Such catalytic effects are limited due to the large carbon-salt contact angle and may be obscured in slurry reactors by the rate of particle-bubble contacting being slow. The steam reforming of residual oil revealed that the carbonized product in the molten salt phase closely resembled sponge petroleum coke (as produced by delayed coking). Cold model experiments employing water and polymeric beads revealed that dilute slurries of small, non-wetting particles decreased the rise velocity of single bubbles and increased the rate of bubble coalescence in swarms.

40|$|In recent years, {{aluminum}} beverage bottles having screw tops {{with opening}} diameters of 28 and 38 mm have been {{launched in the}} Japanese market {{in keeping with the}} modern-day drinking habits of consumers. Although Japanese consumers are familiar with such bottles, a majority of them feel that the 28 mm opening is too small and the 38 mm opening is too large. Therefore, we felt the need to develop a method for evaluating consumer feelings when they drink a beverage directly from the bottle opening. For this purpose, we propose an evaluation function of drinking ease that calculates the optimum opening diameter of the bottle. From results of our previous study, we know that there exists an ideal volume of beverage flowing into the mouth, at which consumers feel most comfortable while drinking directly from bottles. Therefore, we define the evaluation function of drinking ease in terms of the difference between the actual volume of fluid in the mouth and the expected ideal volume. If this difference is small, consumers probably feel comfortable while drinking the beverage. We consider a design variable, i. e., the opening diameter, and two state variables, i. e., the volume of beverage remaining in the bottle and the height of consumers, and construct the response surface of the evaluation function by using radial basis function networks. In addition, for investigating the influence of beverage type on the evaluation function, we select green tea and a carbonated beverage (Coke) as test beverages. Results of optimization of the proposed function show that when the opening diameters are 35. 4 mm and 34. 4 mm in the case of <b>green</b> tea and <b>Coke,</b> respectively, the actual volume of fluid in the mouth is closest to the ideal volume and the participants feel most comfortable. These results are in agreement with results of our previous study that an opening diameter of 33 mm is optimum for young Japanese adults.

Calcining {{is the process of}} heating green petroleum coke in a kiln to remove excess moisture, extract all remaining hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline structure of the coke into a denser, electrically conductive product. The final product, calcined coke, is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of raw coke, or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke. Though calcined coke has shown low hazard potential in human populations due to low volatile content, there remains some public health concern regarding the emissions from these facilities.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale delayed coking process {{was used to}} produce petrol precursors, diesel precursors, methane rich gas, green and calcined coke from five previously untested South African heavy petroleum residues. The ash content of the heavy petroleum residues {{was found to be}} detrimental to the microstructure of the <b>green</b> <b>coke</b> and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the calcined coke. The sulphur content of the calcined cokes produced was found to be in-line with typical global anode grade cokes. De-ashing of the feedstock would be necessary to produce anode grade fillers for the aluminium industry. The local production of anode grade coke would serve to reduce imports and supply the aluminium smelters on the east coast of South Africa. The heavy petroleum residues (also known as heavy fuel oil) are currently used as bunker fuel in the shipping industry and are responsible for substantial air pollution. Delayed coking of these residues could extend the production of petrol and diesel per barrel of imported crude oil and reduce the effect on South Africa’s balance of payments deficit and impact the environment in a beneficial manner with respect to carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions. The research also evaluated the replacement of heavy fuel oil with marine diesel produced by delayed coking of the former. Marine diesel was found to emit less sulphur oxides and have a higher energy density per unit of carbon dioxide emitted. While seawater scrubbing of the heavy fuel oil would be more cost effective in reducing the sulphur oxide emissions, it would not contribute to carbon dioxide reductions.

40|$|This {{research}} study determines {{the potential to}} increase substantially the anisotropy of a coke from an aliphatic Waxy Oil produced by Sasol Synfuels at Secunda, South Africa. Experimental modifications included filtration, distillation and thermal treatment, followed by distillation {{with the aim of}} producing a carbonised product similar to needle coke. The substantial concentration of an iron oxide catalyst (up to 2 %) in Waxy Oil is increased by an order of magnitude upon carbonisation and calcination due to low coke yield and reactivity factors. The catalyst also promotes oxidative polymerisation of the residue, acts as a barrier to mesophase formation and promotes multi-phase graphitisation. Filtration of Waxy Oil using a 0. 5 ìm sintered metal filter reduces the ash content to 0. 006 % and increases the anisotropy of the carbonised product to 54 % flow domains compared with 22 % for the carbonised product of virgin Waxy Oil. Thermal treatment followed by distillation of Waxy Oil reduces the effect of organic reactivity promoters (mainly multi-alkylated aliphatics/aromatics and oxygenates), while increasing the concentration of thermally stable (C 18 to C 30) normal alkanes to 85 % compared with 38 % in the filtered Waxy Oil. Compared with the filtered Waxy Oil, thermally stabilised Waxy Oil reduces the amount of the pre-carbonisation residue (from 98. 7 to 43. 0 %), while “static” carbonisation thereof increases the <b>green</b> <b>coke</b> yield (from 19. 8 to 36. 3 %) and increases the anisotropicity (from 54 to 100 % flow domains). The carbonisation mechanism of filtered and thermally treated Waxy Oil involves initial cracking of high molecular weight normal alkanes (C 18 to C 30), thus concentrating the molecular weight of normal alkanes (C 18 to C 22). This is followed by a slow cyclisation step involving both self condensation and cyclo addition reactions to form two- to six-ring cyclo-alkanes or hydro-aromatics. The hydro-aromatics are dehydrogenated rapidly to form methyl and di-methyl three- to six-ring substituted aromatics. Further thermal degradation dealkylates these molecules to form stable four- to six-ring “pre-mesogens”. The mesospheres are nucleated from the isotropic matrix and grow to more than 0. 050 mm in diameter, with a volume of 2. 61 x 10 - 3 mm 3. Subsequent coalescence of the mesospheres produces mesospheres with diameters of over 0. 200 mm and volumes of 41. 82 x 10 - 3 mm 3. The resultant microstructure of the solid carbon is composed of flow domains more than 400 ìm in length. Although needle cokes have historically been produced from aromatic residues, this research is the first to show that a coke with a similar microstructure can be produced from a totally aliphatic residue. The research thus provides potential {{for the development of a}} needle coke from a totally unique Waxy Oil residue with negligible sulphur (< 0. 008 %) and nitrogen (< 0. 09 %) contents.

40|$|Pitches {{are used}} {{on a large scale}} in the {{manufacture}} of carbon anodes for the production of primary aluminium. The role of the pitch is to act as a binder between the petroleum coke grains. The structure of the carbonized pitch binder (pitch coke) has an important impact on the overall performance of the anode. Even though the binder pitch is the minor constituent in an anode, it is impossible to make a good quality anode without a good quality binder pitch. Pitch is an extremely complex mixture of numerous, essentially aromatic and heterocyclic compounds derived from pyrolysis of organic material or tar distillation. Upon heat treatment pitches form cokes in relatively high yields. Physical and chemical properties of the anode such as mechanical strength, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and resistance towards oxidation by air and CO 2 are dependent on the structure of the aggregate material as well as the carbonized binder pitch. The properties of the pitch coke is in turn mainly dependent on the chemical characteristics of the parent pitch. Coal-tar pitch is the preferred choice of binder material in anode manufacture today. However, the availability of high quality coal-tar is in decline and at least partial replacement by alternative binder sources will become increasingly important in the future. Due to environmental regulations, petroleum pitches are interesting as they generally have lower PAH emissions than coal-tar pitches during baking. Blends of coal-tar pitches and petroleum pitches are in use today on an industrial scale. The aluminium industry must be prepared to meet the challenges involved in adapting binder pitches from new sources which may be of inferior quality to the pitches available on the market today. An increased understanding of the processes involved in the transformation of a pitch into a coke and the link between raw material composition and properties and the final artifact is thus highly relevant. Traditionally, the suitability of a binder pitch for use in anodes, has been defined from parameters like softening point, insolubility in toluene (TI) and quinoline (QI), coke yield, H/C atomic ratio, ash content and density. Although these parameters, which are mostly empirical in nature, give an indication of the pitch quality, more information on the chemical characteristics and carbonization behavior of pitches is certainly valuable. The present work aims to describe and explain the link between “classical” pitch properties, hydrogen transfer properties, information derived from NMR spectroscopy and the structure of the carbonized binder pitch. Coal-tar and petroleum pitches pass through a fluid stage during carbonization. In the early stages of carbonization, free radicals are formed due to thermal rupture of C-C and C-H bonds in reactive components. Polymerization occurs mainly via a free radical mechanism leading to molecular size enlargement (aromatic growth) and the formation of oligomeric systems (mesogens). If the intermolecular reactivity of the pitch constituents is too high, extensive cross-linking and a rapid transformation of pitch molecules through polymerization will occur at a relatively low temperature. In this case, either mesophase will not be formed or the growth and coalescence of mesophase will take place under low fluidity/high viscosity conditions leading to a premature solidification of the pyrolysis system. An isotropic coke or a pitch coke of small optical domains will then be formed. On the other hand, if the pitch has a low thermal reactivity, aromatic growth is constrained and the mesogens will have sufficient mobility to stack parallel to each other and establish a liquid crystal system (mesophase). The growth and coalescence of mesophase take place at a higher temperature where the viscosity of the pyrolysis system is at a low level. Eventually, the system will solidify and an anisotropic coke of large well-developed optical domains is formed. In particular, the presence of alkyl side chains and oxygenated functional groups are considered to lead to an increased thermal reactivity. If free radicals formed by thermal rupture of bonds in reactive pitch species can be stabilized by hydrogen transfer from within the system, extensive cross-linking at a too early stage is prevented. The initiation, growth and coalescence of mesophase are facilitated and consequently a coke of large well-developed optical domains is formed. Hydroaromatic rings and naphthenic rings in hydroaromatic species are considered to be principal hydrogen donor groups. Oxygen acceptor sites are believed to deplete the supply of donatable hydrogen and leave radicals free to recombine. The thermal reactivity of a pitch is thus dependent on both the amount of reactive species and the ability of the pitch to stabilize free radicals by hydrogen transfer. In the present work, the subject of study was five coal-tar pitches and four petroleum pitches. In addition, a QI-free coal-tar pitch supplied by GrafTech International was studied. The pitches were characterized by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, hydrogen transfer properties, elemental analysis and the release of volatiles during carbonization. In addition, the pitches were characterized by more “traditional” pitch parameters like insolubility in quinoline (QI), insolubility in toluene (TI), softening point and coking value. The structure of the carbonized pitches was examined by optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The hydrogen transfer properties of the pitches were evaluated from their ability to donate hydrogen to an acceptor compound, anthracene, or abstract hydrogen from a donor compound, 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin). A mixture of pitch and anthracene or tetralin was heat treated in sealed glass tubes filled with argon gas at 400 ºC. Two different heat treatment procedures were tested. In the first, the sample was kept at 400 ºC for 8 hours while in the second, the sample was heated at a rate of 5 ºC/min to 400 ºC with no soaking time. The major hydrogenated products from the reaction between anthracene and pitch were 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene (DHA) and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroanthracene (THA). After the reaction, the semi-coke residue was dissolved in carbon disulphide and analyzed by gas chromatography. The hydrogen donor ability (HDa) was calculated from the amounts of DHA and THA formed and expressed as milligrams of hydrogen transferred to anthracene per gram of pitch. For the hydrogen donor ability test, the less severe heat treatment (5 ºC/min to 400 ºC, no soaking time) was found to be the most appropriate. The reaction between tetralin and pitch gave one major dehydrogenated product, naphthalene. The hydrogen acceptor ability (HAa) was calculated from the ratio of naphthalene to tetralin as determined by gas chromatography and expressed as milligrams of hydrogen transferred per gram of pitch. For the acceptor ability test, the heat treatment at 400 ºC with 8 hours soaking time was found to be the most appropriate. The release of volatiles during carbonization was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The amount of volatiles released between 300 and 500 ºC (VM 300 - 500) relative to the total amount of volatiles released at 1000 ºC was selected as a parameter reflecting the thermal behavior of pitches during the critical stages of carbonization. Carbonization of pitches was performed under inert gas pressure (15 bar) and the green cokes obtained at 550 ºC were studied by optical microscopy. Computerized image analysis was performed to quantify the optical texture. The output parameters from the image analysis were the mosaic index, which {{is a measure of the}} optical domain size, and the fiber index, which is a measure of the parallel alignment of optical domains. The green cokes were further heat treated to 1150 ºC and the microstructure of the resulting calcined pitch cokes was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The carbon disulphide soluble part of the pitches was investigated by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Results from elemental analysis of the pitches were used in conjunction with the results obtained from the NMR spectroscopy. The main objective of the NMR analysis was to identify and quantify structures in the pitch which are considered either to increase or decrease the thermal reactivity. The coal-tar pitches were as expected found to be more aromatic than the pitches of petroleum origin. A relationship was found between the aromaticity of the pitches and the H/C atomic ratio as determined from elemental analysis. Elemental analysis is a rapid and convenient method to estimate the aromaticity of pitches. Due to a more hydroaromatic structure, the petroleum pitches were in general found to have a higher estimated concentration of donatable hydrogen which will suppress intermolecular reactivity. However, the petroleum pitches also had a high concentration of alkyl side chains which are generally believed to give increased thermal reactivity. Carbon connected to oxygen could not be distinguished in the NMR spectra. Pitch constituents containing heteroatoms are generally concentrated in the heavier pitch fractions which may not be soluble in carbon disulphide. This could be an explanation for the failure in the detection of aromatic carbon connected to heteroatoms. However,the oxygen content was determined by elemental analysis. The pitches could be distinguished due to their ability to donate hydrogen to anthracene or abstract hydrogen from tetralin. The hydrogen donor ability was not found to correlate with the concentration of donatable hydrogen (NMR) which might have been expected. A likely explanation for this apparent inconsistency is that potential donatable hydrogen in reactive pitches will be preferentially consumed by free radicals and oxygenated acceptor sites instead of being transferred to anthracene. A correlation between the hydrogen donor (HDa) and acceptor ability (HAa) was not found. This indicates that the two parameters represent two separate properties where both are linked to the thermal reactivity of the pitch. The ratio between the hydrogen donor and acceptor ability, HDa/HAa, was used as a parameter reflecting the thermal reactivity of pitches. Pitches which exhibit a high HDa/HAa ratio (low thermal reactivity) are expected to form an anisotropic coke of large optical domains. On the other hand, pitches with a relatively low HDa/HAa ratio are expected to have a high thermal reactivity and form a more isotropic (small optical domains) coke. Despite the higher concentration of donatable hydrogen, the petroleum pitches were not generally considered to have a lower thermal reactivity than the coal-tar pitches expressed by the HDa/HAa ratio. The processes taking place during thermal treatment of pitches are reflected in the release of volatiles. A correlation was observed between the HDa/HAa ratio and the relative amount of volatiles released between 300 and 500 ºC (VM 300 - 500). Thermally reactive pitches exhibiting a low HDa/HAa ratio will have a high activity at low temperatures and release low boiling point molecules and fragmentation species. If on the other hand the pitch has a low thermal reactivity, fragmentation species will be stabilized by hydrogen transfer and retained in the pyrolysis system. The resulting thermally stable molecules of relatively low molecular weight may then act as solvating vehicles maintaining a low viscosity in the system and may also be important as hydrogen shuttling agents. When the system has reached a critical stage for mesophase growth and coalescence, these smaller thermally stable molecules (non-mesogens) are eventually released at higher temperatures. The petroleum pitches developed cokes of relatively large optical domains (coarse mosaic). A correlation was observed between the HDa/HAa ratio and the mosaic index (size of optical texture) for the petroleum pitches. As expected, a high thermal reactivity (low HDa/HAa ratio) resulted in a pitch coke of small optical domains (high mosaic index). The HDa/HAa ratio was, however, not successful in predicting the size of optical texture in the cokes obtained from the coal-tar pitches. This was mainly due to the influence of QI material on the pitch coke structure. It is recognized that particulate matter (primary QI material) hinders the growth and coalescence of mesophase. This was found for the coal-tar pitches. Scanning electron (SEM) and polarized light microscopy images taken at a high magnification revealed how the QI particles were arranged and clustered around smaller anisotropic domains. The detrimental effect of QI material on the development of anisotropic texture in the resulting coke was demonstrated by comparing the structure of the coke obtained from a QI-free coal-tar pitch and a coal-tar pitch containing QI. The QI-free pitch developed a coke of large optical domains whereas the coke obtained from the pitch containing QI material had mainly a fine mosaic texture (small optical domains). However, some large anisotropic domains were present in between the QI clusters. It is also not to be excluded that the QI fraction not only acts physically by obstructing the growth and coalescence of mesophase but may also be chemically active. Findings indicate that the oxygen is concentrated in the QI fraction. Solid QI particles with oxygenated functional groups or heteroatomic structures containing oxygen, which due to their large size are insoluble in quinoline, may act as acceptor sites for hydrogen thus increasing the thermal reactivity. The average coherent stacks of the calcined (1150 ºC) pitch cokes was found to consist of between 7 and 8 graphene layers (Lc divided by d 002). The average crystallite size (Lc) was fairly similar for all the calcined pitch cokes but significant differences were found. The coal-tar pitches generally developed cokes of slightly higher average crystallite sizes than the pitches of petroleum origin. The microstructure of the coal-tar pitch cokes is probably influenced by the amount and nature of the QI fraction. For the petroleum pitches there was a tendency that a high average crystallite size was connected to a more well-developed structure (larger domains) at the <b>green</b> <b>coke</b> stage. The evaluation of hydrogen donor and acceptor abilities provides a rapid and relatively simple method to differentiate pitches which can be linked to the development of structure during carbonization. These properties thus reflect the thermal reactivity of pitches and can be connected to the release of volatiles during pyrolysis. However, for coal-tar pitches the QI content was found to be the most influential factor on the development of optical texture and must be considered in addition to the hydrogen transfer properties. Considerations on thermal reactivity from NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis were found to generally support the results from the hydrogen donor and acceptor ability tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
