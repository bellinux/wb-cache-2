500|$|Some of {{the staff}} were tired of the delays—Duke Nukem Forever was the only 3D game many had worked on, giving them little {{to put on a}} resume, and as much of 3D Realms' payment hinged on {{profit-sharing}} after release, the continual delays meant <b>deferred</b> <b>income.</b> By August 2006, between 7–10 employees had left since 2005, a majority of the Duke Nukem Forever team (which in recent months had shrunk to around 18 staff). While Shacknews speculated that the departures would lead to further delays, 3D Realms denied the claims, stating that the employees had left over a number of months and that the game was still moving ahead. Creative director Raphael van Lierop, hired in 2007, played through the completed content and realized that there was more finished than he expected. Lierop told Broussard that he felt they could push the game and [...] "blow everyone out of the water", but Broussard responded that the game was still two years away from completion.|$|E

5000|$|The Internal Revenue Service {{followed}} {{the holding of}} this case with Revenue Ruling 83-106 which held that an accrual method casino is required to include in income all gambling revenue originating from extensions of credit in {{the year in which}} the gambling obligations arise. This is important because it makes clear that a right to income can be fixed for purposes of the [...] "all events" [...] test of accrual method taxpayers without there being a legally enforceable right to the income.

50|$|Residency {{systems may}} provide that {{residents}} {{are not subject}} to tax on income outside the jurisdiction until that income is remitted to the jurisdiction. Taxpayers in such systems have significant incentives to shift income outside its borders. Depending on the rules of the system, the shifting may occur by changing the location of activities generating income or by shifting income to separate enterprises owned by the taxpayer. Most residency systems have avoided rules which permit <b>deferring</b> <b>income</b> from outside its borders without shifting it to a subsidiary enterprise due to the potential for manipulation of such rules. Where owners of an enterprise are taxed separately from the enterprise, portable income may be shifted from a taxpayer to a subsidiary enterprise to accomplish deferral or elimination of tax. Such systems tend to have rules to limit such deferral through controlled foreign corporations. Several different approaches have been used by countries for their anti-deferral rules.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The study finds {{pervasive}} earnings {{management by}} {{firms in the}} downward direction during the 1990 - 1991 recession. Mean discretionary accruals estimated from the Jones model (1991) were negative and significant in Q 4 1990, when the recession was at its most severe stage, and the lowest of the 19 quarters examined. More interestingly, {{the general direction of}} earnings management appears to be highly predictable. Mean discretionary accruals are mostly negative in quarters of very strong or very weak real GDP growth, and mostly positive in other quarters. Regression fitting a quadratic function to the relationship of mean discretionary accruals with real GDP growth confirms that the relationship has the shape of an inverted U. Given that the “true” corporate earnings (before manipulation) and real economic growth are likely to be highly correlated, the result is consistent with the hypothesis that managers <b>defer</b> <b>income</b> in periods of very weak earnings (when they have no chance of receiving bonuses linked to earnings) and periods of strong earnings (when the bonus cap has already been reached) to future periods and manipulate earnings upward in other periods. The finding that mean discretionary accruals were negative during the 1990 - 1991 recession is als...|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} book value is, relatively, {{the easiest and}} the least {{time-consuming}} method of enterprise assets’ valuation. However, the reliability of valuation by means of this method is questionable. The source of this doubt {{can be attributed to}} the problem of equivocal qualification of some liabilities to equities or to outside capital. <b>Deferred</b> <b>incomes</b> and charges are a particular example of the said liabilities. One of the reasons of showing deferred charges on the assets side and provisions on the liabilities side is the existence of a transitory difference in the income tax. The author of the paper raises the question if this difference influences the value of net assets, and if so, whether it depends on the way it is included in the formula of determining this value? It has been proved that the influence of the allocation for the transitory difference in the income tax on the value of net assets depends on the method of their classification when determining this value. It has also been proved that, at the point of calculating the value of net assets, there exists a problem of classifying some liabilities as equities or as outside capital and that it is needed that each and every part of a balance included in this calculation be dealt with individually...|$|R
40|$|The “Net Present Value {{after tax}} ” of a {{portfolio}} {{at a given}} time is the relevant variable to measure performance of financial strategies. Prior to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) a variety of transactions with derivatives could be used to <b>defer</b> <b>income</b> and to accelerate loss. ERTA has led to significant restrictions to use straddles for tax motivated purposes. Additionally wash sale and constructive sale rules, which interact with the straddle rule, prevent the investor to use derivatives to reduce tax payments. In this thesis we develop a synthesizing technique using derivative instruments to circumvent these problems. These hedging positions created are uncorrelated to the original position — they do not comprise a straddle — although their composition is economically offsetting. With this technique it is possible to pass wash sale, constructive sale and the straddle rules. We will illustrate this in two case studies. First, we consider a company, which uses derivatives for hedging purposes. Second, we use an enhanced version applied to an individual who wants to increase his after tax income significantly. We illustrate the strategies using the Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, the risk is measured by Value at Risk method (VaR). Although we mainly focus to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the USA, we want to mention that the strategy works in other countries in a similar way. We will indicate the differences, when they are due. Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|Borehole radar is a short-range, {{high-resolution}} geophysical {{technique that}} can be used to delineate the position of the Merensky platinum reef in underground mines situated in the Western Bushveld Complex. In this study, borehole radar is used in reflection mode from four boreholes drilled sub-parallel to the expected position of the Merensky Reef within an underground mining block bounded by two cross-cuts and a haulage. This study relates the stratigraphic column at Amandelbult Section to borehole radar reflectivity. The radar illumination line coordinates produced along the Merensky Reef surface are used to construct a three-dimensional surface of the reef within the defined mining block. The geophysical interpretation presented here shows how a slump in the Merensky Reef, called a pothole, is imaged using borehole radar. This study analyses the increase in geological confidence related to the improved delineation of the elevation of the Merensky Reef. The financial impact of using borehole radar to delineate this pothole is analysed at the various mining steps, namely: orebody definition, mine planning, mine development, ore extraction and ore processing. The information gained by conducting borehole radar is compared with the information acquired using only standard geological drilling. This study concludes that the application of borehole radar significantly increases the confidence in the geological model prior to mining. Conducting borehole radar prior to mining improves mine planning and development, ensures that less waste is mined, facilitates the effective deployment of labour crews, prevents waste being sent to the processing plant and avoids <b>deferring</b> <b>income</b> until a later date. Recommendations are made on how to plan for and include borehole radar in the mining process. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Geologyunrestricte...|$|R
5000|$|Accelerated {{depreciation}} {{refers to}} any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or tax purposes, depreciates a fixed asset {{in such a way that}} the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset’s life. For financial accounting purposes, accelerated depreciation is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation expense will more accurately represent how much of an asset’s usefulness is being used up each year. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation provides a way of <b>deferring</b> corporate <b>income</b> taxes by reducing taxable income in current years, in exchange for increased taxable income in future years. This is a valuable tax incentive that encourages businesses to purchase new assets.|$|R
