5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the <b>inductance.</b> The unit of <b>inductance</b> is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the <b>inductance</b> that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual <b>inductance.</b> These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

Norton designed the filter in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of mechanical quantities to electrical quantities to realise the filter using mechanical components.

In addition, the variations of the winding <b>inductances,</b> which are associated with the position of the rotor, can provide essential information for the sensorless drive of a permanent magnet machine. This paper presents the analysis of nonlinear <b>inductances</b> of a newly developed short-stroke permanent magnet tubular linear motor. The winding <b>inductances</b> including self and mutual <b>inductances</b> are computed through an accurate method based on nonlinear finite element solution. In order to have a good understanding of the effects of both structural and magnetic saliencies, the <b>inductances</b> under different positions of moving armature as well as different saturation conditions are analysed and some interesting information is observed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Regarding the {{importance}} of short circuit and inrush current simulations in the split-winding transformer, a novel nonlinear equivalent circuit is introduced in this paper for nonlinear simulation of this transformer. The equivalent circuit is extended using the nonlinear <b>inductances.</b> Employing a numerical method, leakage and magnetizing <b>inductances</b> in the split-winding transformer are extracted and the nonlinear model <b>inductances</b> are estimated using these <b>inductances.</b> The introduced model is validated and using this nonlinear model, inrush and short-circuit currents are calculated. It has been seen that the introduced model is valid and suitable for simulations of the split-winding transformer due to various loading conditions. Finally, the effects of nonlinearity of the model <b>inductances</b> {{are discussed in the}} following...|$|R
5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was <b>inductance</b> present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some <b>inductance</b> on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E

This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E

The specific duality of positive linear electrical circuits composed of resistances, <b>inductances,</b> capacitances and source voltages is established. 1) The linear electrical circuits are positive {{if and only if}} the common branches between meshes with resistances and <b>inductances</b> and meshes with resistances and capacitances contain only source voltages; 2) In linear electrical circuits the interchanges of the <b>inductances</b> by the capacitances and the capacitances by <b>inductances</b> do not change the asymptotic {{stability of the}} electrical circuits.

In particular {{they are used}} in combinations, such as LC, to mean, for instance, a network consisting only of inductors and capacitors.

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of <b>inductance,</b> elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the <b>inductance.</b> Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of phase <b>inductances</b> to the changes in rotor position and armature current in Flux-Switching PM machines (FSPM). FSPMs exhibit combined advantages of both Switched Reluctance Machines (SRM) and Double Salient PM machines (DSPM). Energy conversion in a FSPM {{is based on the}} change of phase <b>inductances,</b> which depends not only on phase current but also on the presence of PMs. To obtain more insight, phase <b>inductances</b> are calculated as functions of both position and current in a 3 -phase 12 / 10 FSPM. Using Finite Element Method (FEM), static (absolute) and incremental (dynamic) <b>inductances</b> are compared for nonlinear operation of the FSPM. A unique behaviour of dq-axes <b>inductances</b> in FSPM is observed, which requires a review of their definitions due to their crucial importance for control systems.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} systematic matrices operation derived from Kirchhoff s Node Law with {{the base of a}} simple two-coil inductor model to deduce leakage <b>inductances</b> of windings seen from the schematic point of view. This method provides a platform in calculating leakage <b>inductances</b> of complex transformer structures. Its robustness covers different kinds of concentric winding structures where by getting accurate values of mutual <b>inductances</b> between all combinations of winding elements in a pair-wise sense, accurate leakage <b>inductances</b> can be deduced through the matrices operation without any computational simulations. In essence, such operation reduces lots of difficult magnetic problems within a transformer into determination of mutual and self <b>inductances</b> of winding elements through a simple two-coil inductor model.

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as <b>inductance</b> and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter <b>inductance</b> to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} <b>inductance</b> to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In the {{previous}} works, based on winding function theory, {{the calculation of}} reluctance machine <b>inductances</b> is carried out using numerical integration or inexact analytical equations based on approximated Fourier series expansions of the inverse air gap function. In this paper, development in Fourier series of the inverse air gap function has not been used, but a closed form analytical equation is developed for <b>inductances</b> calculation. This leads to a very precise computation of the <b>inductances</b> of the faulted machine and more accurate results.

5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the <b>inductance</b> of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
