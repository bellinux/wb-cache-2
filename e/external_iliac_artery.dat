Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.|$|E
60|$|October 31.--My weak lungs, {{combined}} with the exciting episodes of the voyage, have shaken my nervous system {{so much that the}} most trivial incident affects me. I can hardly believe that I am the same man who tied the <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>artery,</b> an operation requiring the nicest precision, under a heavy rifle fire at Antietam. I am as nervous as a child. I was lying half dozing last night about four bells in the middle watch trying in vain to drop into a refreshing sleep. There was no light inside my cabin, but a single ray of moonlight streamed in through the port hole, throwing a silvery flickering circle upon the door. As I lay I kept my drowsy eyes upon this circle, and was conscious that it was gradually becoming less well-defined as my senses left me, when I was suddenly recalled to full wakefulness by the appearance of a small dark object in the very centre of the luminous disc. I lay quietly and breathlessly watching it. Gradually it grew larger and plainer, and then I perceived that it was a human hand which had been cautiously inserted through the chink of the half-closed door--a hand which, as I observed with a thrill of horror, was not provided with fingers. The door swung cautiously backwards, and Goring's head followed his hand. It appeared in the centre of the moonlight, and was framed as it were in a ghastly uncertain halo, against which his features showed out plainly. It seemed to me that I had never seen such an utterly fiendish and merciless expression upon a human face. His eyes were dilated and glaring, his lips drawn back so as to show his white fangs, and his straight black hair appeared to bristle over his low forehead like the hood of a cobra. The sudden and noiseless apparition had such an effect upon me that I sprang up in bed trembling in every limb, and held out my hand towards my revolver. I was heartily ashamed of my hastiness when he explained the object of his intrusion, as he immediately did in the most courteous language. He had been suffering from toothache, poor fellow! and had come in to beg some laudanum, knowing that I possessed a medicine chest. As to a sinister expression he is never a beauty, and what with my state of nervous tension and the effect of the shifting moonlight it was easy to conjure up something horrible. I gave him twenty drops, and he went off again with many expressions of gratitude. I can hardly say how much this trivial incident affected me. I have felt unstrung all day.|$|E

30|$|Patients {{with simple}} pubic rami {{fractures}} {{can be divided}} into two main groups: young people subject to high-energy trauma and elderly people who sustain osteoporotic fractures after minor falls. Cases associated with lifethreatening arterial injury mostly relate to the high-energy group. We report the case of a 70 -year-old woman in whom a low-energy fall caused a stable pubic rami fracture injury associated with angiographyproven multiple hemorrhage from branches of both the internal and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> which necessitated embolization of the bleeding vessels. As far as we are aware, angiography-proven bleeding from branches of the internal and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> in a low-energy, stable pubic rami fracture has not been reported before.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CVD risks {{associated}} with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and aortic calcification (AC) are well known, but less is known about other calcified arteries. We aimed to assess the associations of arterial calcification in the breast, splenic, and internal and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> with CVD risk factors and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a case-cohort study nested in a cohort of 5196 individuals who self-referred or were referred by a health care provider for whole body computed tomography (CT), including a random subcohort (n = 395) and total and CVD mortality cases (n = 298 and n = 90), who died during a median follow-up of 9. 4 years. Arterial calcification in the breast, splenic, and internal and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> on CT was scored using a simple visual score. AC and CAC were previously measured using the Agatston technique. Logistic regression models were made to study associations of CVD risk factors with calcification in the different vascular beds. Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for CVD risk factors, and calcification in other vascular beds, were used to study associations with mortality. RESULTS: In the subcohort, the mean age was 56. 6 years (SD 11. 1) and 41. 3 % were female. The prevalence of calcification on CT, was 11. 6 % in the splenic, 47. 9 % in the internal iliac and 9. 5 % in the <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries,</b> while 3. 7 % of women had breast artery calcification (BAC). Calcification in the splenic and <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> was associated with calcification in the abdominal aorta but differentially associated with other CVD risk factors in logistic regression models. The prevalence of BAC was too low to fit these multivariable models. Calcification of the <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> {{was significantly associated with}} both all-cause and CVD mortality, but no longer significant when adjusted for CVD risk factors. Breast artery calcification was associated with both all-cause and CVD mortality independent of CVD risk factors and AAC and CAC (all-cause HR 5. 67 [95 % CI 1. 50 - 21. 41]). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors associated with calcification, and the association of calcification with risk of mortality differ across vascular beds, possibly reflecting different pathophysiology...|$|R

It passes down along the brim of the pelvis and gives off two large branches - the [...] "inferior epigastric artery" [...] and a [...] "deep circumflex artery."

40|$|Introduction: Congenital atresia of {{the common}} and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> is a rare {{vascular}} anomaly that {{may be associated with}} congenital renal or genitourinary malformations. In ESRD patients, its presence may pose potential problems during renal transplantation. Case presentation: We report a rare case of kidney transplantation in a patient with VACTERL syndrome who was found to have absent right common and <b>external</b> <b>iliac</b> <b>arteries</b> during pre-operative imaging. Vascular supply to the right lower limb is derived from an anomalous branch from the left internal <b>iliac</b> <b>artery</b> which takes on a convoluted course across the pelvis. Kidney transplantation was performed successfully with implantation performed on the left side. Discussion: Isolated cases of congenital <b>iliac</b> <b>artery</b> atresia have been described in association with urological abnormalities but no clear association has yet been established. However, we feel that it may be useful to perform routine angiographic evaluation for ESRD patients with congenital genitourinary abnormalities being planned for kidney transplantation. While most cases of congenital <b>iliac</b> <b>artery</b> anomalies are symptomatic with claudication, some remain asymptomatic with normal physical examination findings. There is some evidence in literature suggesting the usefulness of routine pre-operative CT in a selective group of patients. Conclusion: Kidney transplantation in such cases is safe and we recommend routine pre-operative imaging of patients known to have congenital genitourniary abnormalities. The kidney should be implanted heterotopically to the contralateral side of the vascular anomaly and care must be taken to preserve vascular supply to the lower limbs...|$|R
