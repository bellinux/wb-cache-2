40|$|Long-term phenological {{development}} of forest {{trees and shrubs}} is an important indicator {{of changes in the}} onset of specific phenological phase at different sites in relation to meteorological conditions. Correlation analysis and linear multiple regression were used to establish relationship between phenological phases for Fagus sylvatica and Aesculus hippocastanum and mean monthly air temperatures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Kočevje locality in the period 1961 - 1990. Correlation coefficients between the onset of phenological phases with air temperature of the previous 2 - 3 months were relatively high. <b>For</b> Fagus sylvatica, <b>the</b> highest variability was explained with phenological model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beginning of leaf colouring (58 %) with first independent variable mean monthly temperature <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of February, April and May and as second independent variable mean monthly temperature <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of July, August and September. <b>For</b> Aesculus hippocastanum, <b>the</b> highest variability was explained with phenological model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beginning of flowering (65 %) with first independent variable mean monthly temperature <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of April and May and as second independent variable mean monthly temperature <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> of January, February and March.
