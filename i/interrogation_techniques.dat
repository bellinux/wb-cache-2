5|$|After {{the death}} of bin Laden, some {{officials}} from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced <b>interrogation</b> <b>techniques</b> they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier.|$|E
5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced <b>interrogation</b> <b>techniques</b> attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E

5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended <b>interrogation</b> <b>techniques,</b> since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Mora actively argued {{with a large}} number of the most senior lawyers and officials of the military and the Defense Department that the <b>interrogation</b> <b>techniques</b> that had been approved were unlawful. On January 15, 2003, he received word from William Haynes, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, that Rumsfeld would be suspending the authority for the extraordinary <b>interrogation</b> <b>techniques</b> later that day.

An error of only ± 2. 2 με is achieved over a temperature range from 15 to 50 °C, indicating that this strain <b>interrogation</b> <b>technique</b> is temperature insensitive.
