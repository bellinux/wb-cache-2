A single zone thermodynamic model, coupled to a kinetic mechanism, is developed to predict the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> of Primary Reference Fuels (PRFs) in an HCCI engine. The model, consisting of 120 chemical reactions and 58 species, is validated against the experimental data from a single cylinder engine for various operating conditions. The model is able to predict the effects of different charge parameters on the HCCI <b>ignition</b> <b>timing.</b> This model is used to perform a sensitivity analysis of HCCI <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> to the variations of engine charge properties {{in order to examine}} the relative importance of different charge properties for control applications. The sensitivity analysis is done for these main charge variables: initial temperature, initial pressure, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) rate, equivalence ratio, and octane number. The simulation results show that the sensitivity of HCCI <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> is dependant on the crank angle position of the Start of Combustion (SOC).

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{the effect of the}} <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> on the output {{parameters}} of a spark-ignition engine. The main assessed parameters include the output parameters of the engine (engine power and torque), cylinder pressure variation, heat generation and burn rate. However, the article also discusses the effect of the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> on the temperature of exhaust gases, the indicated mean effective pressure, the combustion duration, combustion stability, etc. All measurements were performed in an engine test room in the Department of Technology and Automobile Transport at Mendel University in Brno, on a four-cylinder AUDI engine with a maximum power of 110 kW, as indicated by the manufacturer. To control and change the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> of the engine, a fully programmable Magneti Marelli control unit was used. The experimental measurements were performed on 8 different <b>ignition</b> <b>timings,</b> from 18 °CA to 32 °CA BTDC at wide throttle open and a constant engine speed (2500 rpm), with a stoichiometric mixture fraction. The measurement results showed that as the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> increases, the engine power and torque also increase. The increase in these parameters is a reflection of higher pressure in the cylinder, the maximum value of which is achieved at a higher <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> near top dead centre in thepower stroke. In these conditions we can expect higher engine efficiency. It was also found that the combustion is more stable with a higher value of <b>ignition</b> <b>timing.</b> No significant difference was found in the combustion duration...|$|R

50|$|Setting {{the correct}} <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> {{is crucial in}} the {{performance}} of an engine. Sparks occurring too soon or too late in the engine cycle are often responsible for excessive vibrations and even engine damage. The <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> affects many variables including engine longevity, fuel economy, and engine power. Modern engines that are controlled in real time by an engine control unit use a computer to control the timing throughout the engine's RPM and load range. Older engines that use mechanical spark distributors rely on inertia (by using rotating weights and springs) and manifold vacuum in order to set the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> throughout the engine's RPM and load range.|$|R

30|$|The above figure {{shows that}} Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) tends to {{increase}} with <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> advance between 21 and 41 ° BTDC. It {{is expected that}} IMEP should increase with timing angle advance to a point, and then drop off. Best performance will be achieved when the greatest portion of the combustion takes place near top dead center. If the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> is not advanced enough, the piston will already be moving down when much of the combustion takes place. In this case we lose the ability to expand {{this portion of the}} gas through the full range, decreasing performance. If the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> is too advanced, too much of the gas will burn while the piston is still rising. The work that must be done to compress this gas will decrease the net work produced. These competing effects cause there to be a maximum in the IMEP as a function of <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> advance.|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) has {{potential}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of Spark Ignition (SI) or Compression Ignition (CI) engines particularly at part load near the partial burn/misfire limit. Two challenges of HCCI combustion are: maintaining constant <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> despite no direct mechanism to start combustion, and to expand the part load region of HCCI near the misfire limit. To accomplish these goals {{it is critical to}} have accurate online and offline estimates of <b>ignition</b> <b>timing.</b> For offline operating condition <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> calculation, a new method is proposed which combines the Coefficient of Variation of Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (COVImep) and percentage of cycles with less than 90 percent heat release of previous cycle. Particularly near the partial burn/misfire limit, this method is more reliable than just COVImep. For online <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> estimates, a new method in which the ratio of the peak of main stage and cool flame stage of heat release curve (HTR to HTRLTR Peak Ratio) is used for each cycle. Using this method, normal and partial burn engine cycles can be determined in realtime for fuels exhibiting a cool flame. The two methods are tested on 115 HCCI experimental operating points, in which 300 cycles of cylinder pressure data are collected, and are found to be more reliable than existing methods in the literature. With a more reliable partial burn <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> criteria, this information could be used in future studies in a feedback control to stabilize <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> in these regions and thus extend the useful operating range of HCCI. 2...|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the necessity of <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> correction when the regular gasoline vehicle is being adapted for the use of E 85 fuel. Tests were conducted in the Alternative Fuels Research Laboratory of Latvia University of Agriculture in December 2013. The engine was fuelled with the ethanol-gasoline blend E 85 or the commercial gasoline A 95. The engine was tested within a vehicle in a chassis dynamometer in steady state conditions, which resemble driving at 50 kmh- 1 and 90 kmh- 1.

The findings of the experiments suggest that higher thermal efficiency and therefore improved fuel economy {{can be obtained from}} SI engines running on LPG as opposed to gasoline. The cycle-by-cycle variation of IMEP with LPG combustion can be reduced by advancing the idle <b>ignition</b> <b>timing.</b> The results of the study at wide open throttle opening conditions indicate that there is an increase in the brake thermal efficiency with LPG use in the engine at higher operating speeds when compared to gasoline at the factory set idle <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> of 5 o bTDC.
