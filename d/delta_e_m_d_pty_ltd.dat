40|$|Photon {{transmission}} technique {{was used to}} monitor the evolution of transparency during film formation from poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) latex particles. The latex films were prepared below the glass transition temperature (T-g) of PVAc. These films were annealed at elevated temperatures in various time intervals above the T-g of PVAc. It is observed that transmitted photon intensity (I-tr) from these films increased as the annealing temperature is increased. It is seen from I (tr) curves {{that there are two}} film formation stages. These successive stages are named void closure (viscous flow) and interdiffusion. The activation energies for viscous flow (Delta H) and backbone motion (<b>Delta</b> <b>E</b> (b)) were obtained by using well-defined models. The averaged values of the backbone (<b>Delta</b> <b>E</b> (b)) and the viscous flow activation energies (Delta H) were found to be 188. 6 and 5. 6 kcal/mol, respectively.

40|$|We {{report that}} the SOS {{response}} is induced in Escherichia coli by infection with mutant filamentous phage that are defective in initiation of the complementary (minus) -strand synthesis. One such mutant, R 377, which lacks the entire region of the minus-strand origin, failed to synthesize any detectable amount of primer RNA for minus-strand synthesis. In addition, the rate of conversion of parental single-stranded DNA of the mutant to the double-stranded replicative form in infected cells was extremely slow. Upon infection, R 377 induced the SOS response in the cell, whereas the wild-type phage did not. The SOS induction was monitored by (i) induction of beta-galactosidase in a strain carrying a dinD::lacZ fusion and (ii) increased levels of RecA protein. In addition, cells infected with R 377 formed filaments. Another deletion mutant of the minus-strand origin, <b>M</b> 13 <b>delta</b> <b>E</b> 101 (<b>M.</b> H. Kim, J. C. Hines, and D. S. Ray, Proc.
