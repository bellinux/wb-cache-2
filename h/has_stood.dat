Cast in bronze, the Balzac Monument <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> since 1939 nearby the intersection of Boulevard Raspail and Boulevard Montparnasse at Place Pablo-Picasso. Rodin featured Balzac in several of his smaller sculptures as well.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a source of employment {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international passenger station it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the Channel Tunnel (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.|$|E

5|$|James II's statue <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> {{in several}} {{locations}} {{since it was}} first erected. It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall's Pebble Court, where it was installed on New Year's Day, 1686. It was situated behind the Banqueting House and faced the river, a position which attracted much satirical comment after James' flight from London during the Glorious Revolution of 1688; {{it was said that}} the statue's location indicated his method of escape.|$|E
5|$|The mosque was {{originally}} a small prayer house built by Umar the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, but was rebuilt and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished {{by his son}} al-Walid in 705 CE. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in 754. His successor al-Mahdi rebuilt it again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir built another mosque which <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> to the present day.|$|E
5|$|This {{philosophy}} of approaching {{the art of}} acting <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting {{for much of the}} 20th century to this day. Mikhail Chekhov considered Ivanov a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, {{or in any other}} sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Allied Breweries {{sold its}} 35 per cent {{stake in the}} company, leaving Whitbread 25 per cent and the Boddington family 10 per cent, with the {{remainder}} of company shares held by small shareholders in the Manchester area. That year Guinness Draught stout and Heineken lager were introduced into the tied estate. During the 1970s the company operated within a 70-mile radius of Manchester, and growth was driven by the increasing popularity of its main product, Boddingtons Bitter. The Observer commented in 1974 that Boddingtons cheap pricing and distinctive flavour afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981 the same newspaper commented, what <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive flavour of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical {{town hall}} built in 1841, {{eight years before}} Oldham {{received}} its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from {{the steps of the}} town hall when he was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been actioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} central murti (image) of Vithoba at Pandharpur, and various textual references to it, have inspired theories relating to Vithoba worship. Sand concludes, from a version of Pundalik's legend in the Skanda Purana (see Legend below), that two distinct murtis must have existed at Pandharpur—one each of tirtha and kshetra type. The earlier one was a tirtha murti, an image purposely sited near a holy body of water (tirtha), in this case facing west, on the Bhima riverbed, near the Pundalik shrine. The later murti, according to Sand, was a kshetra murti, located at a place of holy power (kshetra), in this case facing east, on the hill where the current temple <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> since about 1189. Thus, Sand proposes that the worship of Vithoba may predate the temple itself.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{regarded}} as Canada's greatest soccer player of all time, {{and as one}} of the greatest ever women soccer players, Sinclair is a fast, well-rounded, physically strong, and intelligent forward, known for her ball skills, athleticism, and technique. An accurate finisher, and a highly prolific goalscorer, she is a versatile and hard-working player, who is capable of playing both as a striker, and also as an advanced playmaker in midfield, due to her passing accuracy, ability to read the game, link-up with other midfielders, and create chances for teammates. Sinclair is also capable of scoring from free-kicks and penalties. In addition to her footballing abilities, she <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> out for her leadership and defensive work-rate throughout her career.|$|E
5|$|After being {{disgusted with}} the state of the Square and {{learning}} that a councillor <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa (Lucy Benjamin), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although, Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub. Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.|$|E
5|$|The Grade I listed Christchurch Castle is of Norman {{origin and}} was {{originally}} of a motte and bailey construction. The castle once dominated the town but now lies in ruins {{and only a}} couple of the keep walls remain. A castle <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> in Christchurch since approximately 924 AD when Edward the Elder fortified the town with a wooden fort on a motte. After the Norman conquest in 1066 the castle's defences were strengthened with a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade. The wooden fort was replaced; at first with another wooden structure and then a stone keep which was constructed in the 12th century. Within the curtain wall of the castle stands the Constable's House, a Grade I listed Norman dwelling. Much of the building's stonework remains, including a rare example of a Norman chimney (one of only five in the country) and the privy which extends out across the mill stream. The castle was slighted by the Parliamentary army during the English Civil War to prevent the stronghold from falling into Royalist hands.|$|E

5|$|Upon Lee's {{return from}} the army, Whitney gives the {{relationship}} another chance. She struggles {{with the prospect of}} making their romance sexual, but eventually agrees to when he talks about his feelings for her. Ryan's young daughter Lily Branning (Aine Garvey) comes to live in Walford when her mother Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) is sent to prison, and Whitney babysits her. She puts a photo of herself and Lily online and is shocked when Ryan contacts her under the alias of 'Simon Parker'. After speaking with Johnny and Lee, she decides to reply. Stacey is granted her appeal and freed but Whitney worries it will ruin her relationship with Lily. Whitney tells Lily about Ryan saying she could possibly meet him. When Stacey finds out, she argues with Whitney and says she will not be seeing Lily again. Whitney then messages Ryan saying she needs to see him urgently. Whitney then arranges to meet Ryan at the park. Stacey and Lily visit the park whilst Whitney is waiting for Ryan. Stacey apologises to Whitney and she accepts. Whitney thinks Ryan <b>has</b> <b>stood</b> her up, so leaves with Stacey and Lily. Ryan turns up late and hides on seeing Stacey, and remains unseen as a result.|$|E
