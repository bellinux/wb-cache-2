30|$|In this review, recent {{progress}} toward the integration of CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> into OSCs was summarized. The review focused on two OSC layers: the photoactive layer and the charge transport layer. For the photoactive layer, CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> act as electron acceptors in combination with electron-donating polymers. The addition of CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> with ideal BHJ structure and energy level tuning of CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> are key factors for enhancing the performance of OSCs. For the charge transport layer, CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> have excellent potential to enhance the performance of conventional OSCs due to their high conductivity. In particular, the air-stable nature of <b>graphenes</b> makes them attractive for replacing PEDOT:PSS in OSC transport layers to improve long-term device stability.|$|R
30|$|Multi-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs) and <b>graphenes</b> {{have been}} taken for novel reinforcements due to their unique structure and performance. However, MWCNTs or <b>graphenes</b> reinforced copper matrix composites could not catch up with ideal value due to reinforcement dispersion in metal matrix, wettability to metal matrix, and composite material interface. Taking advantage of the superior properties of one-dimensional MWCNTs and two-dimensional <b>graphenes,</b> complementary performance and structure are constructed to create a high contact area between MWCNTs and <b>graphenes</b> to the Cu matrix. Mechanical alloying, hot pressing, and hot isostatic pressing techniques are used to fabricate Cu matrix self-lubricating nanocomposites. Effects of MWCNTs and <b>graphenes</b> on mechanical properties and microstructures of Cu/Ti 3 SiC 2 /C nanocomposites are studied. The fracture and strengthening mechanisms of Cu/Ti 3 SiC 2 /C nanocomposites are explored {{on the basis of}} structure and composition of Cu/Ti 3 SiC 2 /C nanocomposites with formation and function of interface.|$|R
40|$|In this {{proceedings}} {{paper we}} report on a calculation of <b>graphene's</b> Landau levels in a magnetic field. Our calculations {{are based on a}} self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation for <b>graphene's</b> massless-Dirac continuum model. We find that because of <b>graphene's</b> chiral band structure interactions not only shift Landau-level energies, as in a non-relativistic electron gas, but also alter Landau level wavefunctions. We comment on the subtle continuum model regularization procedure necessary to correctly maintain the lattice-model's particle hole symmetry properties...|$|R
5|$|As of 2009, <b>graphene</b> {{appears to}} be the strongest {{material}} ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes.

5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{thermal conductivity}} of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for <b>graphene,</b> and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for <b>graphene</b> nanoribbons. Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic. The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|We have {{employed}} first-principle calculations to study transformation of <b>graphene’s</b> electronic structure under functionalization by covalent bonds with di erent atomic and molecular groups - epoxies, amines, PFPA.

We also discuss the influence of charge exchange between the functionalizing molecule and <b>graphene’s</b> conjugated electrons on electron transport properties...|$|R
30|$|Integration of CNTs or <b>graphenes</b> in OSC photoactive layers {{typically}} {{involves the}} dispersion of CNTs or <b>graphenes</b> in electron-donating polymers. In these OSC designs, CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> act as electron acceptors {{and replace the}} conventional electron acceptors such as 6, 6 -phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or 6, 6 -phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM). In OSCs, photons are absorbed in the photoactive layer and generate excitons (bound electron–hole pairs). These excitons diffuse into the photoactive layer with an exciton diffusion length of 5 – 20  nm [16], and dissociation of excitons occurs at the donor/acceptor interface. Then, separated holes and electrons are transported to the charge transport layer or electrodes via the electron donor or acceptor phase, respectively [17 – 20]. CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> can also provide exciton dissociation sites and charge pathways in the photoactive layer, and the higher conductivities and mobilities of CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> are greater than those characteristic of conventional electron acceptors.|$|R

25|$|Alternatively, {{carbon-based}} compounds like <b>graphene</b> {{have also}} been proposed. First identified in the nineteenth century, an easy method of producing <b>graphene</b> was not available until 2004. Being a particular form of carbon, <b>graphene</b> typically exists in its stable form of graphite, a widely used material in many applications – the lead in a mechanical pencil being an example. When a single monolayer of carbon atoms is extracted from nonconductive bulk graphite, electrical properties are observed contributing to semiconductor behavior, making it a viable substitute for silicon. More research {{will need to be}} performed, however, on sub 50nm <b>graphene</b> layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.|$|E

They speculated that by rolling <b>graphene</b> layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of <b>graphene</b> hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).|$|E

30|$|Integration {{of carbon}} nanomaterials, such as carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) and <b>graphenes,</b> is a promising way {{to overcome the}} limitations of conventional organic materials. CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> exhibit greater mobility and conductivity [5 – 11] than conducting polymers and can, thus, provide highly conductive pathways for carrier transport. The interface between carbon nanomaterials and polymers can generate spatial separation of the charges from the photoexcited carriers in the photoactive layer [12, 13]. Furthermore, semiconducting single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) exhibit a small energy bandgap and a broad absorption band that is expanded into the near-infrared range [14, 15]. As charge transport materials, optically transparent and highly conductive CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> can act as effective charge collection materials without preventing photon absorption in the photoactive layer. For these reasons, CNTs and <b>graphenes</b> would likely be excellent candidates for enhancing the performance of OSCs.|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of multilayer <b>graphenes</b> depends strongly {{on the number}} of layers as well as the stacking order.

We find both that the zero-magnetic-field transport and the quantum Hall effect at high magnetic fields are distinctly different from the monolayer and bilayer <b>graphenes,</b> and that they show electron-hole asymmetries that are strongly suggestive of a semimetallic band overlap. When the ABA trilayers are subjected to an electric field perpendicular to the sheet, Landau-level splittings due to a lifting of the valley degeneracy are clearly observed...|$|R
