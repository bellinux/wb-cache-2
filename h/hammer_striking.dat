5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodes piano {{features}} a keyboard {{with a similar}} layout to a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The touch and action of the keyboard {{is designed to be}} as close to a piano as possible. Pressing a key results in a <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger [...] "tone bar". The whole [...] "tone generator assembly" [...] acts as a tuning fork, the tone bar reinforcing and extending the vibrations of the tine. A pickup sits opposite the tine, picking up its vibrations and inducing an electric current in a similar manner to an electric guitar. The basic mechanical act of hitting tines does not need an external power supply, and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.|$|E

50|$|The {{blacksmith}} lapwing or {{blacksmith plover}} (Vanellus armatus) occurs commonly from Kenya through central Tanzania to southern and southwestern Africa.

50|$|A variant on the Marxophone idea is the marxoguitar or guitar-marxophone, {{created by}} Ranjit Bhatnagar. In 2010 {{he made a}} six-hammer device that could be {{attached}} to an electric guitar at the bridge, creating a Marxophone-like repeated <b>hammer</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{planishing}} hammers {{are generally}} {{in contact with}} the outside surface of the piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) planishing <b>hammers</b> <b>strike</b> hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
50|$|Another type, the single-stroke bell, has no {{interrupting}} contacts. The <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> the gong once {{each time}} the circuit is closed. These are used to signal brief notifications, such as a shop door opening for a customer, rather than continuous warnings.|$|R

50|$|Sodium chlorite, {{like many}} {{oxidizing}} agents, {{should be protected}} from inadvertent contamination by organic materials to avoid {{the formation of an}} explosive mixture. The chemical is highly stable in pure form and does not explode on percussive impact (unless organic contaminants are present, e.g. a greasy <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> the chemical on an anvil) and will also ignite if combined with a strong reducing agent.|$|E
50|$|The male {{has one of}} {{the loudest}} calls of any bird - a sharp sound like that of a <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> an anvil or a bell, emitted by the male while it perches on a high branch in order to attract a mate. The sound is so loud, that it can be heard up to a mile away and can {{apparently}} cause damage to human hearing if heard from close range.|$|E
50|$|The Dulcitone has {{a similar}} sound to the {{glockenspiel}} since its sound is made by <b>hammers</b> <b>striking</b> tuning forks. The dulcitone uses soft hammers which damp the forks, compared to the hard hammers of the glockenspiel, creating a more gentle sound.|$|R

Hence comes the name [...] "Etchmiadzin", which translates literally to [...] "the place" [...] where Miatsin descended.|$|E

40|$|This study delves {{into the}} history of the presentations and transformations of John Massey’s As the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Strikes</b> (A Partial Illustration) (1982) and Douglas Gordon’s Play Dead; Real Time (2003). John Massey’s As the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Strikes</b> (A Partial Illustration) was {{initially}} presented as three synchronised 16 mm film projections. Its presentation format was migrated twice and from a film installation it became a video installation. Douglas Gordon’s Play Dead; Real Time was first exhibited as a three-channel video installation (two screens and one monitor). In some recent exhibitions, depending on the space allowed and the configuration of the room, the artist has chosen to add a second monitor, meaning that the work temporarily became a four-channel video installation. In this paper, I explore how the re-exhibitions of these two artworks have challenged their authenticity...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} designs for {{automatic}} center punches {{have been developed}} since the late 19th century as improvements over punches requiring {{the use of a}} striking tool. The earliest types were not fully automatic, using a captive weight lifted by the user or a spring and weight drawn by the user to provide the striking impulse. A number of patents have been issued for these designs, and they continue to be referenced in patents into the 21st century. There are also a number of examples of hammer and punch combinations intended for one-handed use, but being modeled upon a conventional <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> a separate punch tool.|$|E
5000|$|Another form uses {{either a}} bevel-edged anvil or setting block {{so that the}} saw blade rests on a flat portion of the anvil and the tooth held over the bevel, to be struck until bent to the desired angle (Fig. A). Its use is {{described}} by the following:"...lay the block, Fig. A, in some convenient flat place and hold the tooth of saw so that the point projects over the beveled surface fully one-quarter of an inch. Give two or three strokes with a light <b>hammer,</b> <b>striking</b> the tooth always about one-quarter of an inch from the point. Regulate the set {{by the use of}} set gauge..." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{bare-throated bellbird}} (Procnias nudicollis) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Cotingidae. It is found in moist {{subtropical}} and tropical forests in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The male has white plumage and bristly bluish-black bare skin around its eye, beak and throat. The female is more drab, being olive-brown above with streaked yellow underparts. The male {{has one of the}} loudest bird calls known, producing a metallic sound similar to a <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> an anvil. This bird feeds on fruit and plays a part in dispersing the seeds of forest trees. It is considered a vulnerable species because of loss of its forest habitat and collection for the pet bird trade.|$|E
