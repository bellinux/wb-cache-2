5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward to Jordan, {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton. From Weedsport to Jordan, NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and <b>followed</b> that road to Jordan, where NY31 turned north and <b>followed</b> modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 <b>followed</b> Downer Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it <b>followed</b> a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and <b>followed</b> it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E

The British Army dispatched troops to Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, which was <b>followed</b> by the Anglo-Irish War in January 1919 and the Third Anglo-Afghan War in May 1919. The Third Afghan War was <b>followed</b> by the 1920 conflict between British forces and Somaliland dervishes. Those not involved in fighting or occupation duties were demobilised. The demobilisation of 4,000,000 men that <b>followed</b> {{the end of the}} war had, within a year, reduced the British Army to 800,000 men; by November 1920, two years after the signing of the Armistice, this figure had fallen to 370,000 men.|$|E

5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, <b>followed</b> by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were <b>followed</b> by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, <b>followed</b> by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, <b>followed</b> by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were <b>followed</b> by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
