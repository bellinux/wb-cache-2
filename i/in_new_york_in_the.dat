In 1932 Rossen directed John Wexley's Steel, about labor agitation, and Richard Maibaum's The Tree, about a lynching. A year later Rossen directed Birthright, in which Maibaum attacked Nazism, which had just triumphed in Germany with the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler in 1933.|$|E

5|$|I Vampiri was {{released}} in Italy on 5 April 1957 in San Remo. It grossed a total of 125.3 million Italian lire on its initial theatrical run.

5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Alex {{is able to}} prove her innocence {{with the help of}} her friends. She discovers that the {{suspected}} bomber is former FBI analyst-trainee Elias Harper, who planted the bomb on the instructions of a terrorist mastermind. Having cleared her name at a congressional hearing, Parrish is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> operations section, she works to uncover the mastermind behind the bombings, as the 2016 Presidential election nears. The supervising training agent Liam O'Connor is eventually revealed to be the responsible individual and is shot and killed by Parrish and Booth.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the second day, June 23, the Committee on Permanent Organization {{announced}} the roster of officers, including the permanent president, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky. Before the delegates could formally elect Stevenson, they heard the report on the Committee on Credentials. Two rival factions of Massachusetts Democrats had agreed to compromise, both being admitted as a united delegation. A similar dispute in New York was not resolved so easily: Tammany Hall and Tilden's Irving Hall had sent rival delegations as well, and neither was willing to compromise. The Committee had voted to consider the Irving Hall Democrats to have been regularly elected; Tammany was consequently excluded. Debate followed, in which some delegates urged compromise, with the idea that a united delegation would help unite the party <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming general election. The argument was unpersuasive, as the delegates endorsed the Committee's decision by a vote of 457 to 205½; Tammany was banished. Stevenson was then installed as permanent chairman and, as the Committee on Resolutions had not finished writing the platform, the delegates moved on to nominations.|$|E
5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also worked {{with a number of}} musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E

5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently {{cited as a}} seminal album in the field. The no wave movement that developed <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, is often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also has}} a widespread distribution in North America. In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec. In the United States, it is most common in the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascade Mountains, where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months. Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, and consequently, much literature published since then has reported the species {{to be present in}} the eastern United States. Gaston Guzman later examined Peck's herbarium specimen, and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on Psilocybe, concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as Panaeolina foenisecii. P.semilanceata is much less common in South America, where it has been recorded in Chile. It is also known in Australia (where it may be an introduced species) and New Zealand, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands. In 2000, it was reported from Golaghat, in the Indian state of Assam.|$|E
