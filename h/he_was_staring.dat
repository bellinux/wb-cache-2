2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the space between the}} upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E

60|$|We {{know why}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at Alice, {{but of course}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> too gallant a gentleman to tell. Besides his astonishment has dazed him.|$|R
60|$|The silvery figure {{among the}} green leaves seems to linger as if hypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> {{at the man}} below.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> still <b>staring</b> at {{the plastic}} bag when the room outside vanished.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} him, {{surprised}} at the question. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at the English shore.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> moodily at the {{elevator}} boy {{and did not}} seem to hear.|$|E
60|$|De Marmont {{this time}} {{had nothing to}} say. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> moodily and silently before him.|$|E
60|$|Hodder wondered. Presently {{he found}} himself before a {{photograph}} on the wall beyond, at which <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> unconsciously.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of Major Horace Bell. From the chest up. In his 60 's or 70 <b>'s,</b> <b>he</b> has a bushy white handlebar moustache and white fluffy hair that sticks up {{on the top of}} his head. He's wearing a dark jacket over a dark vest and a white shirt with a high collar. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> intently turned to his right.;...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Philip Burr had no words. His cigar {{had dropped}} {{on to the}} carpet. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> simply <b>staring.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ann swung round, {{and gazed}} at her uncle in concern. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> blankly at the paper.|$|E
60|$|Rutherford did not reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> thoughtfully at the floor. He did {{not seem}} to have heard.|$|E
60|$|Runyon made no reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} ahead, in a dazed, bewildered way, and now Mildred’s {{eyes followed}} his.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Nick had risen, and <b>he,</b> too, <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at her. How {{he managed to}} appear so well dressed was a puzzle to me.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> {{through her}} {{rather than at}} her, so it had seemed to Joan. Suddenly their eyes met, and he broke into a smile.|$|R
60|$|Rowland had fancied that Roderick {{had no more}} surprises for him; but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now <b>staring</b> at him, wide-eyed.|$|R
60|$|Ortheris did not reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{across the}} valley, with {{the smile of}} the artist who looks on the {{completed}} work.|$|E
60|$|The captain did not answer. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} before him, {{as if he}} {{saw something}} invisible in eyes forever closed in death.|$|E
60|$|Billy said nothing. With steady eyes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{into the}} fire, {{and she knew}} he was turning {{something}} over in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] {{said the}} woodpecker. [...] "Do {{you see a}} man sitting by the fire looking at us? <b>He</b> has <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> at us that way all the evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah but it was," [...] {{he gently}} insisted. And he stared before him now as <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> {{for so many}} weeks. [...] "I was to have known myself." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} it as it receded. Then <b>he</b> seemed to <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> at distant things.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> past my shoulder, and on {{the instant}} I was aware of a voice--not the aëronaut's--speaking behind me, and, as it were, out of the clouds-- ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the captain}} paid no heed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> wild-eyed into vacancy and {{rumpling}} his grey hair until it stood at all angles. His face reflected varying emotions.|$|E
60|$|This man's {{eyes were}} still gleaming, and under their curiously deep tan his bearded cheeks were pale. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} {{in front of him}} with an unseeing gaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR CHARLES, After {{my speech}} to-night, embodying my most {{unalterable}} convictions [KATHERINE {{turns and looks}} up at him, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> straight before him, and with a little movement of despair she goes on writing] I have no alternative but to place the resignation of my Under-Secretaryship in your hands. My view, my faith in this matter may be wrong--but I am surely right to keep the flag of my faith flying. I imagine I need not enlarge on the reasons----" ...|$|R
60|$|He put the {{elevation}} down. He took the plan {{from her hands}} and seemed to study it. But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really <b>staring</b> blankly at the whole situation.|$|R
60|$|Turning to Big Otter, I {{found that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} <b>staring</b> {{at me with}} an expression of such awful solemnity that I was partially roused with a feeling of alarm.|$|R
60|$|The {{big blue}} eyes of Basil Grant were {{standing}} {{out of his}} head and he was paying no attention to me. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{over the side of the}} tram.|$|E
60|$|The captain did not speak. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> fascinated at {{the thing}} on the table. Mrs. Pickett turned to Mr. Snyder. Her eyes, as they met his, held him entranced.|$|E
6000|$|Father Brown did not answer. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring,</b> with a knot in his forehead, at the landscape; and he {{suddenly}} pointed at it. [...] "What's that house over there?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which? where? Oh, if I {{could only}} get one!" [...] said Charley, looking up eagerly at the {{screaming}} birds, at which <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> so long, in their varying and crossing flight, that his sight had become hopelessly unsteady.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't I be in this?" [...] {{the third}} man, young Lord Felixstowe, suggested, leaning forward and {{dropping}} the eyeglass through which <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> at Jacob. [...] "Seems to me I am {{as likely to}} land the fish as any of you." ...|$|R
60|$|Ingleby did {{not look}} at her. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{apparently}} <b>staring</b> at the forest, which loomed through the whirling haze a faint blur of vanishing trees, and he flung the answer over his shoulder.|$|R
