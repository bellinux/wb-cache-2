5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was planned {{in a matter}} of hours following a meeting between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, during which Holbrooke urged Tuđman to seize Prijedor and threaten to capture Banja Luka from the VRS, short of actually seizing the city, as he believed such a development would force Bosnian Serb leaders to the negotiating table. Inadequate planning and preparation, combined with flawed military intelligence on the defending force and disregard for the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> of the Una and Sava rivers, led to a high number of casualties and little success. The offensive was called off one day after it was launched and the bridgeheads were evacuated. The HV ultimately blamed Major General Vinko Vrbanac for its failure. Vrbanac had authorized the offensive instead of deferring to the Chief of the General Staff General Zvonimir Červenko.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 6, Foote's seven Union gunboats arrived at Fort Henry and {{established}} their position around 12:30p.m. They soon opened fire at 1,700 yards, beginning an exchange of gunfire with Fort Henry that continued for over an hour. After Tilghman rejected an initial call to surrender, the fleet continued to bombard the fort. This was its first engagement using newly designed and hastily constructed ironclads. Foote deployed the four ironclad gunboats in a line abreast, followed by the three timberclads, {{under the command of}} Seth Ledyard Phelps, which were held back for long-range, but less effective fire against the fort. The <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> of the river and the low elevation of Fort Henry's guns allowed Foote's fleet to escape serious destruction. The Confederate fire was able to hit the ironclads only where their armor was strongest. During the bombardment, all four of the Union ironclads were repeatedly hit by Confederate fire. The USS Essex was seriously damaged when a 32-pound shot from Fort Henry penetrated the ironclad, hitting the middle boiler and sending scalding steam through half the ship. Thirty-two crewmen were killed or wounded, including commander William D. Porter. The ship was out of action {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E
30|$|Assessing the {{probability}} of very low or <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> {{is an important issue}} in the management of hydroelectric dams. In the case of the Akosombo dam, very low and <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> result in load shedding of electrical power and flooding in communities downstream respectively. In this paper, we use extreme value theory to estimate {{the probability}} and return period of very low <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> that can result in load shedding or a complete shutdown of the dam’s operations. In addition, we assess the probability and return period of <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> near the height of the dam and beyond.|$|R

500|$|August 23, 1999– Hurricane Bret makes {{landfall}} as a Category3 hurricane on Padre Island, {{becoming the}} first major hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Alicia in 1983. As it approaches landfall, large swells cause minor beach erosion along the coast. Along with rainfall from Bret, beaches in Matagorda County are closed due to the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Further inland, heavy rainfall occurs across South Texas, reaching [...] in Sarita. At {{the height of the}} storm, power outages cut electricity to an estimated 64,000 customers. Due to the small size of Bret and its landfall in a relatively unpopulated region of the Texas coast, damages from Bret total just $15million, but it causes four deaths, all of which are attributed to a semi-trailer truck jackknifing in Laredo.|$|E

500|$|Further {{east in the}} Carolinas, {{five people}} were killed in the Piedmont region due to floods caused by the passing storm. Torrential {{rainfall}} in the area resulted in disruption of power, communications, and traffic. Precipitation in those two states peaked at 9in (230mm) in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, the heavy rainfall forced the issuance of flood warnings on the rising Santee River and its tributaries. The Broad and Congaree Rivers in South Carolina later set <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> records {{due in part to the}} saturated soils caused by the storm. The storm reached Virginia by August12, resulting in additional flooding. A weather station in Richmond, Virginia recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg). There, the James and Rivanna Rivers exceeded their respective flood stages, washing out peripheral crops. Offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, over 100 people were rescued after rough waves swept them away. Moderate gales associated with the storm were reported as far north as New York.|$|E

The Royal Portbury Dock is located on the southern side of the mouth of the river. The deepwater dock was constructed between 1972 and 1977, and is now a major port for the import of motor vehicles. The Royal Portbury Dock has the largest entrance lock into any UK port, accommodating vessels up to [...] beam, [...] length and [...] draft. The Avonmouth Docks are {{on the north side of}} the river and are one of the UK's major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. The first dock at Avonmouth, Avonmouth Old Dock, was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884. In 1907, a much larger dock, the Royal Edward Dock, was opened. The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company. Currently, pilotage is provided by Bristol Pilots LLP who supply authorised pilots for the River Avon and Bristol City docks, as well as the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel. They are based at Avonmouth docks in Bristol.|$|E

The island suffered extensive flooding in 1731, 1736, 1791, 1881 and 1897, and substantial loss of life in the North Sea Flood of 1953. , the flood defences consist of a concrete seawall, flood sirens and an internal surface storm water drainage system.|$|E

Although Glen Canyon was able to meet its required minimum release until 2014, the water level in Lake Mead has steadily declined. The decreasing water level is due to the loss of the surplus water that once made up for the annual overdraft.|$|E
