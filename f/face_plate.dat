5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their temporary partnership they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.|$|E
500|$|Beatty's battlecruisers led the British fleet in its attack, casting {{south into}} the North Sea {{to find the}} enemy during the {{afternoon}} of 31 May 1916. At 14:15, scouting cruisers spotted the German vanguard and Beatty closed to attack the enemy with his main force. Given time to prepare, Hipper was ready for Beatty with his battlecruisers in line to face Beatty's approaching ships with their full broadsides. Hipper was also encouraged by the main German battleship fleet under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, which was steaming northwards close behind him. At 15:45 Beatty came within range of the German fleet and the vanguards engaged one another with their opening fusillades. As the two squadrons closed, the Germans found the range better and faster than the British, who were silhouetted against the sun. As a result, German shells pounded the British ships while the German ships remained untouched for the first 10minutes of the engagement. During {{this stage of the}} battle Lion was hit by nine shells from [...] One shell at 16:00 struck the right upper corner of the left hand gun port at the junction of the <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> and the roof, and punched a piece of the 9-inch <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> into the turret before detonating, blowing off the armoured roof of the turret and starting a fire, which a damage control party working from outside the turret fought to put out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Retrofitting {{by plating}} {{structures}} {{has been found}} to be very efficient. However, tests have shown that externally bonded longitudinal plates are prone to premature debonding. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of published research has also shown that there can be large discrepancies between debonding mathematical models and tests. To overcome this problem and to allow structural engineers to adhesively bond plates with safety and efficiently, a structural engineering approach is suggested whereby many of the debonding mechanisms can be prevented by judicious detailing; this approach can be applied to tension <b>face</b> <b>plates,</b> compression <b>face</b> <b>plates,</b> side plates, U-sectioned plates, and angle-sectioned plates. Four continuous reinforced concrete beams have been retrofitted with adhesively bonded longitudinal plates and tested in order to illustrate this design approach, to directly compare the performance of longitudinal side plates with longitudinal tension <b>face</b> <b>plates,</b> to compare FRP plating with steel plating, and in particular to illustrate the effect of debonding on the sectional ductility of longitudinally plated continuous RC beams.

The British ships were {{still in the process of}} making their turn as only the two leading ships, Lion and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire.

Lion, as the leading British ship, engaged , her opposite number in the German formation. Lützows fire was very accurate, and Lion was hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. By 3:54 the range was down to , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3:57. Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later, but Lützow returned the favour at 4:00 when one of her 305mm shells hit 'Q' turret at a range of [...] The shell penetrated the joint between the nine-inch turret <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> and the 3.5-inch roof and detonated over the center of the left-hand gun. It blew the front roof plate and the center <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> off the turret, killed or wounded everyone in the turret, and started a fire that smouldered, despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burned violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded if it had not already been flooded. Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the mortally wounded turret commander, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded.|$|E

500|$|Welders wear {{protective}} clothing, including {{light and}} thin leather gloves and protective long sleeve shirts with high collars, to avoid exposure to strong ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the absence}} of smoke in GTAW, the electric arc light is not covered by fumes and particulate matter as in stick welding or shielded metal arc welding, and thus is a great deal brighter, subjecting operators to strong ultraviolet light. The welding arc has a different range and strength of UV light wavelengths from sunlight, but the welder is very close to the source and the light intensity is very strong. Potential arc light damage includes accidental flashes to the eye or arc eye and skin damage similar to strong sunburn. [...] Operators wear opaque helmets with dark eye lenses and full head and neck coverage to prevent this exposure to UV light.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{performed}} in search of structures providing better blast protection and to understand the various effects influencing the structural performance. This thesis reports on {{an investigation into the}} behaviour of circular sandwich panels with aluminium honeycomb cores subjected to air blast loading. It focuses on the effect of varying core thickness, plate thickness and panel configuration. In this study, aluminium honeycomb core is sandwiched between mild steel <b>face</b> <b>plates.</b> Quasi-static tensile and compression experiments are performed to characterise the <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> and the honeycombs. Four sandwich panel configurations are proposed and subjected to blast loading. The impulse is generated by detonating plastic explosives at a constant stand-off distance and measured using a ballistic pendulum. The impulse is varied by using different charge masses. It is observed that the panels experience front plate deflection and tearing; honeycomb core crushing and densification; and back plate deflection and tearing. The deformations of the <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> and the cores increased with increasing impulse. Increasing the core thickness delayed the onset of core densification and decreased back plate deflection; and increasing the plate thickness also decreased back plate deflection. The use of an extra sandwich layer helps to provide better structural support but has the penalty of extra mass...|$|R
