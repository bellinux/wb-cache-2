However the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) was not happy about its alliance with the ALF <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology,</b> the ALF’s apparently lavish expenditure of the regional budget, its undisguised favor towards the Aussa area for economic development, and the intrigues of the various members of the Alimirah family with regional players. (Sarah Vaughan notes that [...] "at the outbreak of the Ethio-Eritrean conflict it was reported that one of the sultan’s sons favoured the Eritreans, and another the Ethiopians.") Yet the EPRDF did not want to align with the ANLM <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its association with the hated Derg, so it fostered the creation of a third political organization, the Afar People's Democratic Organization (APDO), which won control of the Afar Region and 3 of the Regions 8 seats in the House of Peoples' Representatives from the ALF in the 1995 general elections.|$|R

By conducting an ideology analysis by examining the language used in the two speeches, and connect that to the metaphors of morality in George Lakoff’s (2002) theory of the Nation-as-Family, the essay will show examples of how the two presidential candidates establish themselves as bearers and protectors of their party’s ideological base and how this can be related to the view on moral in American politics. The Republican Party connects <b>to</b> <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology</b> and the Democratic Party to liberal ideology. The Nation-as-Family theory involves looking at the relationship between the government and its citizens as that between parents and their children. Connected <b>to</b> <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology</b> is the Strict Father who proclaims authority, obedience and character and connected to liberal ideology is the Nurturant Parent who proclaims nurturing, empathy and equal distribution of opportunities. Connected to Strict Father and Nurturant Parent there exists a number of metaphors of morality that helps organize the language being used. Although notions of the ‘wrong’ moralities appear in the ‘wrong’ speeches, the results from the analysis clearly indicates that the Nation-as-Family theory is highly valid in displaying the connections between political speeches and the ideological bases to which the speakers adhere...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to find out}} if Alliansen has lost their Bourgeoisie {{collective}} identity. The comprehensive questions of this essay are: Does liberalism or conservatism dominate the manifesto of Alliansen from 2006 - 2010 compared to the manifesto 2014 - 2018 ? Have Alliansen changed their ideological views to the centre of the political spectrum in their manifesto from 2006 - 2010 compared to the manifesto 2014 - 2018 ?   The method used in this essay is a qualitative dimensional study. The results of the essay show that conservatism dominates both manifestos of Alliansen and show that the ideological view of Alliansen has not changed. Alliansens view of human beings in their manifesto from 2006 - 2010 is pessimistic and so is Alliansens manifesto from 2014 - 2018 and therefore closer <b>to</b> the <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology</b> than the ideology of liberalism. Alliansens view of society is collectivistic in both the manifesto 2006 - 2010 and the manifesto 2014 - 2018 and therefore also closer <b>to</b> the <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology</b> than the ideology of liberalism...|$|R
40|$|Lilli Suburg (1841 - 1923) is {{an author}} in Estonian {{literary}} and cultural history who is not well researched, though her literary output is sufficiently large and her manuscript heritage many-sided, casting light on the little known aspects of her work and activity. Suburg was active in very different fields: she {{is known as a}} writer, journalist, feminist and educator. Her literary work is diverse and prolific; she wrote short stories, children’s stories, journalistic texts as well as philosophical essays. In Suburg’s work the autobiographical element plays a significant role, so that we can say that throughout her whole life she wrote her own autobiography, albeit using different forms. In this article, I example specifically the autobiography written by Lilli Suburg (1841 - 1923) entitled Minu saatusega võitluskäik (My Fight is my Destiny) (1914), with the aim of introducing the text to the modern reader and analysing its content and peculiarities. As the text was published almost a hundred years ago, it deserves to be read anew and given a fresh interpretation from a modern point of view. The text certainly adds some new aspects to understanding Lilli Suburg’s life and activity; in the article I will analyse how Suburg looks at herself and her life and the reasons why she chose to write an autobiography with a feminist emphasis. The autobiography was published in the magazine Naiste Töö ja Elu (Women’s Work and Life) in 1914 and to date it is the first and only feminist autobiography in Estonia. As Suburg had been a contributor to the magazine since its foundation in 1911, it provided a forum where she was able to share her feminist ideas and worldview with the readers. The magazine’s readers were understanding and supportive of feminist ideas, and the magazine’s focus was on women’s issues and women’s interests, the contributors being the leading women of the time. In her autobiography Suburg gives an overview of her life, justifies the choices in her life and how and why she began to fight for women’s rights. Suburg positioned herself as a fighter and argued that it was the facts of her life that shaped her destiny. Suburg used this opportunity of life writing to reveal “the truth” about her life and activity: by creating a textual space for her point of view and her “truth” she wanted to dispel misunderstanding and to overcome a pejorative attitude that she encountered during her lifetime. This is why the text {{can be seen as the}} discourse of “truth”, which should give legitimacy to Suburg’s worldview. The autobiography is structured chronologically and covers Suburg’s life from her birth to her old age. The text is framed by direct addresses to the reader in the first person plural “we” form, through which the author identifies herself with the woman reader, thus lessening the distance between herself and the reader. Suburg emphasises the details in her growth, which shaped her feminist worldview, and by doing so critiques the prevalent gender roles. Suburg presents herself as a lone fighter in the public space at the end of the 19 th century; as a public figure she had no female co-fighters. At the same time she confesses that her position as a fighter for women’s rights was something that she could not give up; although her efforts were fruitless she did not find a way she could retreat. This revelation shows the uniqueness of Suburg’s position: as the only woman in the public sphere in the late 19 th century Estonia, this fighter and feminist could not rely on anyone, not even on the support of women, because the impact of women in public life was insignificant <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>conservative</b> gender <b>ideology</b> and laws and customs that restricted women’s rights. By acting in the public sphere Suburg took over a man’s position; she assumed the role that belonged to men in her time. This made her position particularly vulnerable, but Suburg’s pride and fighting nature did not allow her to surrender and retreat. The autobiography is feminist because of the author’s position, which emphasizes the idea of finding one’s own way. Although many of the episodes described in this text can be found in other autobiographical writings by Suburg, the autobiography offers novel information about her. In Suburg’s view Minu saatusega võitluskäik is a kind of discourse of “truth”, which means that Suburg saw this autobiography as a discourse of “truth telling”. The biographical facts were arguments with which Suburg justified her choices; they served to emphasize the rightfulness of her past life and ideas. Life experience as the criterion for truth pervades the entire autobiography and forms its ideological and narrative backbone. Given this meaning, the autobiography has significance and a wider resonance, and earns the reader’s trust. The role of the reader is to believe Suburg’s narrative such as it is and follow Suburg’s arguments and empathize with her quest for truth. What remains is Suburg’s conviction that her destiny shaped her and that is why she is who she is. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|Frank applies {{his thesis}} {{to answer the}} {{question}} of why these social <b>conservatives</b> continue <b>to</b> vote for Republicans, even though they are voting against their best interests. He argues that politicians and pundits stir the [...] "Cons" [...] to action by evoking certain issues, such as abortion, immigration, and taxation. By portraying themselves as champions of the conservatives on these issues, the politicians can get [...] "Cons" [...] to vote them into office. However, once in office, these politicians turn their attention to more mundane economic issues, such as business tax reduction or deregulation. Frank's thesis goes thus:In order to explain to the [...] "Cons" [...] why no progress gets made on these issues, politicians and pundits point their fingers to a [...] "liberal elite," [...] a straw man representing everything that conservatism is not. When reasons are given, they eschew economic reasons in favor of accusing this elite of simply hating America, or having a desire to harm [...] "average" [...] Americans. This theme of victimization by these [...] "elites" [...] is pervasive in conservative literature, despite the fact that at the time conservatives controlled all three branches of government, were being served by an extensive media devoted only <b>to</b> <b>conservative</b> <b>ideology,</b> and had won 6 of the previous 9 presidential elections.|$|R
