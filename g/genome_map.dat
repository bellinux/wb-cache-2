25|$|The {{human genome}} is the genome of Homo sapiens, which is stored on 23 {{chromosome}} pairs. Whereas a genome sequence lists {{the order of}} every DNA base in a genome, a <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> identifies the landmarks. A <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. While working at the National Institute of Health, Craig Venter discovered a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and began {{to use it to}} identify human brain genes. The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags. Through his scientific research of bringing the world one step closer to personalized medicine, Craig Venter was listed on Time Magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.|$|E
25|$|In animal mitochondria, each DNA strand is {{transcribed}} continuously {{and produces}} a polycistronic RNA molecule. Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the human mitochondrial <b>genome</b> <b>map).</b> During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes.

40|$|After its {{emergence}} in 2003, a livestock-associated (LA-) MRSA clade (CC 398) {{has caused}} an impressive {{increase in the}} number of isolates submitted for the Dutch national MRSA surveillance and now comprises 40 % of all isolates. The currently used molecular typing techniques have limited discriminatory power for this MRSA clade, which hampers studies on the origin and transmission routes. Recently, a new molecular analysis technique named whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> was introduced. This method creates high-resolution, ordered whole <b>genome</b> restriction <b>maps</b> that may have potential for strain typing. In this study, we assessed and validated the capability of whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> to differentiate LA-MRSA isolates. Multiple validation experiments showed that whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> produced highly reproducible results. Assessment of the technique on two well-documented MRSA outbreaks showed that whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> was able to confirm one outbreak, but revealed major differences between the maps of a second, indicating that not all isolates belonged to this outbreak. Whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> of LA-MRSA isolates that were epidemiologically unlinked provided a much higher discriminatory power than spa-typing or MLVA. In contrast, maps created from LA-MRSA isolates obtained during a proven LA-MRSA outbreak were nearly indistinguishable showing that transmission of LA-MRSA can be detected by whole <b>genome</b> <b>mapping.</b> Finally, whole <b>genome</b> <b>maps</b> of LA-MRSA isolates originating from two unrelated veterinarians and thei...|$|R

Therefore, they used SAGE data from three moments of the cell cycle (log phase, S phase-arrested and G2/M-phase arrested cells).

25|$|For human {{mitochondrial}} DNA (and {{probably for}} that of metazoans in general), 100–10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per somatic cell (egg and sperm cells are exceptions). In mammals, each double-stranded circular mtDNA molecule consists of 15,000–17,000 base pairs. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content, with a guanine-rich strand {{referred to as the}} heavy strand (or H-strand) and a cytosine-rich strand referred to as the light strand (or L-strand). The heavy strand encodes 28 genes, and the light strand encodes 9 genes for a total of 37 genes. Of the 37 genes, 13 are for proteins (polypeptides), 22 are for transfer RNA (tRNA) and two are for the small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The human mitogenome contains overlapping genes (ATP8 and ATP6 as well as ND4L and ND4: see the human mitochondrial <b>genome</b> <b>map),</b> a feature that is rare in animal genomes. The 37-gene pattern is also seen among most metazoans, although in some cases {{one or more of these}} genes is absent and the mtDNA size range is greater.|$|E
2500|$|Versteeg et al. (2003) tried, with {{a better}} human <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> and better SAGE taqs, to {{determine}} the characteristics of RIDGEs more specific. Overlapping genes were treated as one gene, and genes without introns were rejected as pseudogenes. They determined that RIDGEs are very gene dense, have a high gene expression, short introns, high SINE repeat density and low LINE repeat density. Clusters containing genes with very low transcription levels had characteristics that were the opposite of RIDGEs, therefore those clusters were called antiridges. LINE repeats are junk DNA which contains a cleavage site of endonuclease (TTTTA). Their scarcity in RIDGEs {{can be explained by}} the fact that natural selection favors the scarcity of LINE repeats in ORFs because their endonuclease sites can cause deleterious mutation to the genes. Why SINE repeats are abundant is not yet understood.|$|E

Simple sequence repeat markers were genotyped onto an existing wide-cross whole-genome radiation hybrid panel for <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> of the Gossypium barbadense line ? 3 - 79 ?. A new mapping panel was created for <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> of the G. hirsutum line ?TM- 1 ?. Carthagene software was compared to RHMAP and found to be superior in most regards. A total of 92 simple sequence repeat markers were genotyped onto the mapping panel for G. barbadense. Data from 64 of the 92 markers were deemed robust and combined with pre-existing data to develop an expanded framework map, which provides partial coverage of 7 chromosomes and three unidentified linkage groups. A new mapping population was created to allow mapping of the G. hirsutum genome. The population was developed by treatment of TM- 1 pollen with 8 krad of radiation, which was used to make more than 1000 controlled cross-pollinations. From these, 979 bolls were harvested and seeds were planted until a population of 115 viable plants was obtained. Of these, 92 were selected at random for inclusion in the <b>mapping</b> panel. Carthagene <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> software was evaluated and compared to the previously utilized RHMAP.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2016. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisor: Kevin Dorfman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 224 pages. Recent developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques {{have opened the}} door for low-cost, high-throughput sequencing of genomes. However, these developments have also exposed the inability of NGS to track large scale genomic information, which are extremely important to understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype. <b>Genome</b> <b>mapping</b> offers a reliable way to obtain information about large-scale structural variations in a given genome. A promising variant of <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> involves confining single DNA molecules in nanochannels whose cross-sectional dimensions are approximately 50 nm. Despite the development and commercialization of nanochannel-based <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> technology, the polymer physics of DNA in confinement is only beginning to be understood. Apart from its biological relevance, DNA is also used as a model polymer in experiments by polymer physicists. Indeed, the seminal experiments by Reisner et al. (2005) of DNA confined in nanochannels of different widths revealed discrepancies with the classical theories of Odijk and de Gennes for polymer confinement. Picking up from the conclusions of the dissertation of Tree (2014), this dissertation addresses a number of key outstanding problems in the area of nanoconfined DNA. Adopting a Monte Carlo chain growth technique known as the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method, we examine the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of DNA and other semiflexible polymers in nanochannel confinement. We begin by analyzing the dependence of molecular weight on various thermodynamic properties of confined semiflexible polymers. This allows us to point out the finite size effects that can occur when using low molecular weight DNA in experiments. We then analyze the statistics of backfolding and hairpin formation in the context of existing theories and discuss how our results can be used to engineer better conditions for <b>genome</b> <b>mapping.</b> Finally, we elucidate the diffusion behavior of confined semiflexible polymers by comparing and contrasting our results for asymptotically long chains with other similar studies in the literature. We expect our findings to be not only beneficial to the design of better <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> devices, but also to the fundamental understanding of semiflexible polymers in confinement...|$|R

50|$|BacMap is a freely {{available}} web-accessible database containing fully annotated, fully zoomable {{and fully}} searchable chromosome maps {{from more than}} 2500 prokaryotic (archaebacterial and eubacterial) species. BacMap was originally developed in 2005 to address the challenges of viewing and navigating through the growing numbers of bacterial genomes that were being generated through large-scale sequencing efforts. Since it was first introduced, the number of bacterial genomes in BacMap has grown by more than 15X. Essentially BacMap functions as an on-line visual atlas of microbial genomes. All of the genome annotations in BacMap were generated through the BASys genome annotation system. BASys is a widely used microbial annotation infrastructure that performs comprehensive bionformatic analyses on raw (or labeled) bacterial genome sequence data. All of the genome (chromosome) maps in BacMap were constructed using the program known as CGView. CGView is a popular visualization program for generating interactive, web-compatible circular chromosome maps (Fig. 1). Each chromosome map in BacMap is extensively hyperlinked and each chromosome image can be interactively navigated, expanded and rotated using navigation buttons or hyperlinks. All identified genes in a BacMap chromosome map are colored according to coding directions and when sufficiently zoomed-in, gene labels are visible. Each gene label on a BacMap <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> is also hyperlinked to a 'gene card' (Fig. 2). The gene cards provide detailed information about the corresponding DNA and protein sequences. Each <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> in BacMap is searchable via BLAST and a gene name/synonym search.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{interest}} in metagenomics and large-scale bacterial genome analysis, BacMap was extensively updated in 2012. With the latest update, all of BacMap’s bacterial <b>genome</b> <b>maps</b> now have separate prophage <b>genome</b> <b>maps</b> as well as separate tRNA and rRNA maps. Each bacterial chromosome entry in BacMap now contains graphs and tables {{on a variety of}} gene and protein statistics. All of the bacterial species listed in BacMap now have bacterial 'biography' cards, with corresponding information on the microbe’s taxonomy, phenotypic traits, other descriptions and electron microscopy or other high-resolution images of the microbe itself. BacMap also has a number of updated data browsing and text searching tools that allow filtering, sorting and more facile display of the chromosome maps and their contents.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, both <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> and {{sequencing}} methods have advanced significantly to provide a foundation for scientists to understand genome structures and functions in many species. Generally speaking, <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> relies on <b>genome</b> sequencing to provide basic materials, such as DNA probes and markers for their localizations, thus constructing the maps. On the other hand, genome sequencing often requires a high-resolution map as a skeleton for whole genome assembly. However, both <b>genome</b> <b>mapping</b> and sequencing have never come together in one pipeline. After reviewing mapping and next-generation sequencing methods, {{we would like to}} share our thoughts with the genome community on how to combine the HAPPY mapping technique with the new-generation sequencing, thus integrating two systems into one pipeline, called HAPPY pipeline. The pipeline starts with preparation of a HAPPY panel, followed by multiple displacement amplification for producing a relatively large quantity of DNA. Instead of conventional marker genotyping, the amplified panel DNA samples are subject to new-generation sequencing with barcode method, which allows us to determine the presence/absence of a sequence contig as a traditional marker in the HAPPY panel. Statistical analysis will then be performed to infer how close or how far away from each other these contigs are within a genome and order the whole genome sequence assembly as well. We believe that such a universal approach will {{play an important role in}} <b>genome</b> sequencing, <b>mapping,</b> and assembly of many species; thus advancing genome science and its applications in biomedicine and agriculture. </p...|$|R
