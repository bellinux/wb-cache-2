40|$|The model {{developed}} {{in this paper}} explains the last-resort borrowing, deposit rate and portfolio decisions of dealers in the official short-term money market. Equations based on the model have been estimated from monthly data and they provide a very good explanation of the variables which {{are the subject of}} the study. They indicate that the last-resort rate has a significant influence on the rates paid on deposits with the dealers. Some equations explaining the supply of funds to the dealers have also been estimated. An important implication of these equations is that trading banks hold these deposits as a liquidity reserve against drawings <b>on</b> <b>overdraft</b> accounts. The policy implications of the results are discussed in the final section of the paper. Keywords...|$|R

The emergence of non-performing loans including bad credit, basically does not occur suddenly, but through a process. Bad credit can be caused either by the creditors (banks) and debtors. If bad credit happens because the debtor does not carry out his achievements as contained in the credit agreement, then before execution collateral, the debtor must first be declared in default, which is done through a court decision. For the creditor must sue the <b>debtor</b> <b>on</b> the basis of default. But before suing the debtor, the creditor must first subpoena the contents so that the debtor fulfill his achievements.

40|$|The Federal Reserve System imposes {{caps and}} charges fees on the {{negative}} intraday balances in banks' reserve accounts. i. e., <b>on</b> daylight <b>overdrafts.</b> Our empirical results suggest that caps alone did little to reduce daylight overdrafts in the aggregate. By contrast, the 1994 imposition of fees reduced the average daily maximum <b>overdraft</b> <b>on</b> the Fedwire system by about $ 93 billion and the average aggregate overdraft {{at any time during}} the day by about $ 43 billion. We also found statistical evidence that higher beginning-of-day reserve balances, lower aggregate dollar values of securities-related transfers over Fedwire, and lower shares of banks' assets funded with federal funds and repurchase agreements reduced daylight overdrafts.

40|$|The {{answer is}} yes. By using {{a unique and}} large data set <b>on</b> <b>overdraft</b> {{contracts}} between banks and microfirms and self-employed individuals, we find robust evidence that women in Italy pay more for overdraft facilities than men. We could not find any evidence that women are riskier then men. The male/female differential remains even after controlling for {{a large number of}} characteristics of the type of business, the borrower and the market structure of the credit market. The result is not driven by lack of credit history, nor by women using a different type of bank than men, since the same bank charges different rates to male and female borrowers. Social capital does play a role: high levels of trust loosen credit conditions by lowering interest rates, but this benefit is not evenly distributed, as women benefit from increased social capital less than men...|$|R
