5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E

Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) Commentators interpret the wu as a female shaman and the wang as a male cripple.|$|R

Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius trivialis is a European {{species that}} is similar in {{appearance}} to L.argillaceifolius, and they are often confused for each other. L.trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich boreal and subalpine forests. Variety megacarpus may be confused with L.pallescens, a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown.|$|E
