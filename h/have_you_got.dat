5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

500|$|A {{southern}} rock album, Move is {{also influenced}} by gospel music. As opposed to the modern rock bent and introspective lyrics of Revelation, lead vocalist Mac Powell felt {{the end result of}} Move was a [...] "down-home, American grassroots record with a lot more gospel elements than [...] ever had before". Although some songs are set from the perspective of someone outside the Christian church, Powell felt the record's lyrics were a call to put faith into action. [...] "Lift Up Your Face", a southern rock song, displays influences from [...] gospel and blues music. Gospel group The Blind Boys of Alabama provide backing vocals in the song, while the lyrics offer a message of encouragement. [...] "Make Your Move", which depicts evangelism {{from the perspective of a}} non-believer, has a grunge-influenced half time chorus. [...] "Children of God" [...] incorporates a children's choir into what is an otherwise rock arrangement. [...] "Surrender" [...] is led by a dobro and has an acoustic rock sound, eventually building up to a climax of guitars and strings. [...] "Follow Me There" [...] has heavy gospel influence combined with a [...] "rootsy rock" [...] sound. [...] "Gone", which features vocals from Bear Rinehart of Needtobreathe, has an acoustic rock sound. [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> to Lose", a ballad, offers the plea: [...] "Sin and shame, guilt and pain, pride and your conceit / Here and now lay them down at the Savior's feet". [...] "I'll Be Your Miracle" [...] has a country rock sound and features instrumentation from banjo and pedal steel guitar. [...] "Sound of Your Voice", a worship song, features vocals from guest vocalist Kerrie Roberts. [...] "Don't Give Up Hope" [...] has [...] "Allman Brothers-style interplay" [...] between the slide guitar and piano instruments.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed to Australia and the United States in March and April 1973, Anderson pitched his idea to Howe, a {{prolific}} songwriter and arranger {{in the group}} who {{took an interest in}} the concept. In their spare time between performances on the tour, the two proceeded to hold [...] "candlelight writing sessions" [...] in their hotel rooms, sharing musical ideas and motifs that suited the album's themes. Howe recalled: [...] "Jon would say to me, 'What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> that's a bit like that...?' so I'd play him something and he'd go: 'that's great. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> anything else?' and I'd play him another tune". One riff that Howe played for Anderson was rejected at first, but it was later incorporated into [...] "The Ancient" [...] as by then, the two sought for a different theme that would suit the track. In one marathon session in Savannah, Georgia, Anderson and Howe completed the outline of the vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation in six hours that ended at 7:00 a.m; by which time, the album took shape {{in the form of a}} double concept album of four side-long tracks. Anderson described the night as [...] "magical" [...] that [...] "left both of us exhilarated for days". When the album was announced to the rest of the group, Howe recalled an agreement to a double album, but one with just four tracks was met with some resistance. [...] "But Jon and I did manage to sell the idea ... sometimes [...] really had to spur the guys on".|$|E

2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson's account, [...] "I remember, when we finished 'Highlands'—there are two other versions of that, the one that made the record is the rundown, literally, {{you can hear the}} beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked. But, anyway, after we finished it, one of the managers came out, and he said, [...] "Well, Bob, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a short version of that song?" [...] And Dylan looked at him and said: 'That was the short version.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prescott {{had success}} in {{focusing}} {{attention on the}} role of car usage in the bigger environmental picture and the need for effective public transport alternatives if car volume is to be reduced. The subsequent debate on road pricing evolved from his policy. A contrast was highlighted between Prescott's transport brief and an incident, in 1999, when an official chauffeur-driven car was used to transport Prescott and his wife [...] from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference, where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public transport. Prescott explained, [...] "Because of the security reasons for one thing and second, my wife doesn't like to have her hair blown about. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> another silly question?" [...] Prescott has been fined for speeding on four occasions.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got,</b> man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
