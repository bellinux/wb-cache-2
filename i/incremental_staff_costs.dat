40|$|Background: This study {{identified}} {{per patient}} resource use and <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> at a cystic fibrosis (CF) outpatient unit {{from the health}} care provider's perspective. Methods: Personnel cost data were prospectively collected for all CF outpatients (n = 126) under routine conditions at the Charit 9 Medical School Berlin in Germany over a six month study period. Patients were grouped according to age, sex and two severity categories. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was performed to determine the impact of various independent variables on personnel costs. Results: The mean <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> were 8 ̆ 0142. 3 per patient over six months of outpatient service. Services provided by physicians were the biggest contributor to <b>staff</b> <b>costs.</b> Patient age correlated significantly and negatively with mean total costs per patient. Conclusions: Age of patient is a significant determinant of <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> for CF outpatient care. For a cost-covering remuneration of outpatient treatment it seems plausible to create separate reimbursement rates {{for two or three}} age groups and to consider additional costs due to tasks carried out by physicians without direct patient contact. The relatively low <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> identified by our study reflect a staffing level not sufficient for specialist CF outpatient care...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of the simulation study is to compare different staff mix scenarios and evaluate them against the performance measures. As stated in the objective, {{the goal of the}} staffing model is to determine the right staff mix that is cost effective, productive, and improves quality of care. <b>Staffing</b> <b>cost</b> and <b>staff</b> utilization levels are used as performance measures to compare the different staff mix scenarios. Considering <b>staffing</b> <b>cost</b> is important because <b>staffing</b> <b>cost</b> directly affects financial performance and sustainability. The staff utilization level also affects the quality of care. As reported in Rose et al. (2012), adequate staff and staff support improves the performance of ACCs.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} new feature {{on the business}} scene {{is the development of}} call centres, whereby a pool of staff is used to answer incoming calls from customers. This project develops a model that enables staffing levels to be determined to meet specified quality targets on customer wait times. Unlike most previous work, this new model explicitly considers call arrival rates that vary during the day, and exploits linkage between periods to keep <b>staffing</b> <b>costs</b> to a minimum. 1 Introduction Many companies now employ a call centre, whereby a pool of staff is used to answer incoming calls from customers. By far, the largest component of cost in call centre operation is <b>staffing</b> <b>cost.</b> Therefore, it is highly desirable to keep staffing levels to a minimum throughout the day. Of course, the objective of minimizing <b>staffing</b> <b>costs</b> is subject to the constraint that customer service remain at a reasonable level throughout the day.

40|$|Potential {{benefits}} to reducing turnover times are both quantitative (e. g., complete more cases and reduce <b>staffing</b> <b>costs)</b> and qualitative (e. g., improve professional satisfaction). Analyses {{have shown the}} quantitative arguments to be unsound except for reducing <b>staffing</b> <b>costs.</b> We describe a methodology by which each surgical suite can use its own numbers to calculate its individual potential reduction in <b>staffing</b> <b>costs</b> from reducing its turnover times. Calculations estimate optimal allocated operating room (OR) time (based on maximizing OR efficiency) before and after reducing the maximum and average turnover times. At four academic tertiary hospitals, reductions in average turnover times of 3 to 9 min would result in 0. 8 % to 1. 8 % When surgeons evaluated the performance of an academic anesthesiology department, they rated turnover times {{as the most important}} quality attribute with below average performance (1). Because neither revenue nor direct patient benefit is provided during clean up and set up times, reducing turnover times would seem to benefit both physicians and hospitals. Analyses have studied the impact of reducing turnover times on increases in caseload (2, 3) and on direc...|$|R
40|$|This study applied panel {{analysis}} {{to determine the}} factors influencing interest margins in Nigeria using bank-specific, sector-specific and macroeconomic data ranging from 2010 :Q 1 to 2014 :Q 2. Based on the Hausman test, a fixed effect model in a generalized form (GLS) was estimated. The result shows that credit risk, growth in loans and advances, <b>staff</b> operating <b>cost,</b> GDP growth, inflation rate and money supply growth are significant determinants of interest margins in Nigeria. Consistent with previous studies, <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> exerts highest impact on interest margins followed by fixed effects term. Further analysis of the banks' fixed effects reveals that seven banks control about 64 %, which raises a policy concern for banks' supervisors. The result also reveals that banks usually transfer their <b>staff</b> operating <b>costs</b> to customers by either imposing exorbitant lending rates or low deposit rates or both. This study recommends the formulation of strategies for reducing growing banks <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> {{in the area of}} levels of compensation, employee turnover, redundancy, automation processes and outsourcing of non-critical tasks should be given due attention to ensure efficiency and competitive margin that could spur growth in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} 2000 - 2004 central banks {{sustained}} a generalized reduction in their staff, which was accompanied, in most cases, with {{significant increases in}} <b>staff</b> <b>costs.</b> This could obey to an enhanced interest of central banks in focusing on their core functions. In fact, central banks have changed the ways they perform their operative functions (e. g. currency operations, payment systems operation, printing notes, etc.) through different strategies aimed at gathering the participation of third parties. These strategies differ according to the relationship that central banks have with the financial sector and the government, {{as well as to}} their historical tradition and modernization trend. To explain the effect of these changes on the staff, we estimated a short-term labor demand function for 66 central banks using a panel data model with random effects. Results indicate that central banks’ labor demand is strongly determined by the country’s population, economic development level and changes in operative functions, as well as by <b>staff</b> <b>costs.</b> In addition, we found a low employment-wage elasticity suggesting the presence of a flexible budgetary constrain in central banks.

50|$|Optimal {{allocation}} of OR {{time should be}} based on historical use by a particular service (i.e., unit of OR allocation such as surgeon, group, department, or specialty) and then using computer software to minimize the amount of underutilized time and the more expensive overutilized time. Under-utilized hours reflect how early the room finishes. In the example above, if staff were scheduled to work from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm and instead the room finished at 11 am, then there would be 4 hours of underutilized time. The excess <b>staffing</b> <b>cost</b> would be 50% (4 hours/8 hours). On the other hand, if 9 hours of cases are performed in an OR with staff scheduled to work 8 hours then the excess <b>staffing</b> <b>cost</b> is 25%. Over-utilized hours are the hours that ORs run longer than the regularly scheduled OR hours, or 1 hr in this example. 1hr/8hr=12.5% which is then multiplied by the additional cost of staying late, which often is assumed to be a factor of two (related to monetary overtime <b>cost</b> paid to <b>staff,</b> as well as recruitment and retention costs related to unhappy staff because they have to stay late unpredictably).OR suites can reasonably aim to achieve a <b>staffing</b> <b>cost</b> that is within 10% of optimal (i.e., workload is perfectly matched to staffing).|$|R
