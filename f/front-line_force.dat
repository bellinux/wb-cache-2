50|$|During World War II, the {{offensive}} air {{forces of the}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) came to be classified as strategic or tactical.

50|$|In the Battle of Afyonkarahisar-Eskişehir, the Greeks {{managed to}} defeat the Turkish {{resistance}} and occupied the two cities, but {{were not able to}} achieve their aim of cutting off their retreat. The Turkish forces managed to retreat and regroup beyond the Sakarya River. In the aftermath of the victory, the Army of Asia Minor's high command was divided as to the course to follow: in a staff council on 13 July, the deputy chief of staff, Col. Ptolemaios Sarigiannis, advocated an immediate advance to exploit the Turks' disorganization, while the head of the supply bureau, Col. G. Spyridonos, warned that the Greek army risked outrunning its supply lines. Despite their misgivings, Papoulas and the Army's chief of staff, Col. Konstantinos Pallis, sided with Sarigiannis, and the decision to resume the offensive was confirmed at a war council under the chairmanship of King Constantine three days later. Frantic efforts were made to repair railway lines and secure the supply routes through the territories conquered, while a few replacements of senior officers also took place, most notably Prince Andrew's assumption of command of the II Corps. At the start of operations, on 1 August 1921, the Army of Asia Minor comprised: I Corps (A. Kontoulis), with the 1st, 2nd and 12th Divisions; II Corps (Prince Andrew), with the 5th, 13th and 9th Divisions; III Corps (G. Polymenakos), with the 3rd, 7th and 10th Divisions, plus the cavalry brigade; and the southern group of divisions (N. Trikoupis), covering the southern flank of the Greek front with the 4th and 11th divisions. The Army's <b>front-line</b> <b>force</b> comprised ca. 80,000 troops.|$|E

However, the Bulls had a larger <b>front-line,</b> <b>forcing</b> Schellhase to play out of natural position as a guard.|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} of the report's recommendations significantly reduced {{the role of the}} reserve army, thoroughly subordinating it to the regular army. The recommended training requirements were never properly implemented, making it practically impossible for the reserve forces to meet regular-force standards, and there were also challenges with equipment and morale. All this took place in an environment where powerful voices, such as that of Field Marshal Montgomery, were deprecating the importance of augmenting mobilization ability (as opposed to maintaining stronger <b>front-line</b> <b>forces).</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 1941, Middle East Forces sent {{troops to}} assist the Greek Army against a {{probable}} German invasion. The bulk of the <b>front-line</b> <b>forces</b> were Australian, New Zealand and Polish troops, but they were supported by British armour {{and a number of}} RE works and transportation units including newly arrived 580th AT Company. The RE units were tasked with repairing and improving the rudimentary road and rail network of the Greek mainland on which the force depended, while simultaneously preparing demolitions to delay the enemy advance.|$|R

[...] Rhodesia's <b>front-line</b> <b>forces</b> never contained more than 25,000 troops, eight tanks (Polish made T-55s) and nine old Hawker Hunter jets. Those forces could still launch raids on enemy bases, but Rhodesia faced diplomatic isolation, economic collapse and military defeat.|$|R
5|$|Operation Brevity was {{a limited}} {{offensive}} conducted in mid-May 1941, during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, Brevity {{was intended to}} be a rapid blow against weak Axis <b>front-line</b> <b>forces</b> in the Sollum–Capuzzo–Bardia area of the border between Egypt and Libya. Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day.|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Rhodesia's <b>front-line</b> <b>forces</b> {{contained}} about 25,000 regular troops and police – {{backed up by}} relatively strong army and police reserves. Its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mine-protected armoured personnel carriers, complemented by eight tanks (Polish built T-55LD tanks), delivered {{in the last year}} of the war. The Rhodesian Air Force operated an assortment of both Canberra light bombers, Hawker Hunter fighter bombers, older de Havilland Vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated, but still potent, helicopter arm. These forces, including highly trained special operations units, were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country, as in Operation Dingo in 1977 and other similar operations.|$|R
5|$|The first broods {{were formed}} by the Overmind, with the {{direction}} of each brood being delegated to a cerebrate. A brood was engineered for a specific function, which impacted its numerical strength and the diversity of its strains. The Terrans gave the Great War broods reporting names based on beasts found in Earth mythology. The Command Wing broods were responsible for defending the Overmind and searching for new species for assimilation. These broods did not engage in front-line combat unless necessary. The Command Wing included the Tiamat Brood, Baelrog Brood, and Fenris Brood. The Attack Wing broods were the Swarm's <b>front-line</b> <b>forces,</b> meant to conquer and occupy worlds.

2500|$|Operation Brevity [...] was {{a limited}} British offensive, planned as a rapid blow against the weak Axis <b>front-line</b> <b>forces</b> around Sollum, Fort Capuzzo and Bardia on the Egyptian–Libyan frontier. The British had {{received}} an Ultra intercept {{of the report}} compiled by Paulus, which dwelt on the exhaustion and the dire supply situation facing the Axis at Tobruk and the frontier, which encouraged a premature attempt to inflict losses on the Axis frontier garrisons and to capture jumping-off places for a later attack towards Tobruk. The garrison of Tobruk, [...] to the west, had resisted Axis attacks and its Australian and British troops could still endanger the Axis supply line from Tripoli, which led Rommel to give priority to the siege, leaving the front line thinly held.

50|$|As {{the size}} and weight of night-fighting {{equipment}} remained considerable in comparison to airframe size and engine power, the day fighter remained a part of <b>front-line</b> air <b>forces</b> into the 1960s. In the immediate post-war era, designs like the North American F-86 Sabre, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and Hawker Hunter typified the day-fighter role.

50|$|At 08:30 on November 28, {{with massive}} {{artillery}} support, Japanese troops again attempted an assault {{up the sides}} of both Akasakayama and 203 Meter Hill. Over a thousand 500 lb shells from the 11 in howitzers were fired in a single day to support this attack. The Japanese reached as far as the Russian line of barbed wire entanglements by daybreak and held their ground throughout the following day, November 29, while their artillery kept the defenders busy by a continuous bombardment. Nonetheless, the Japanese forces suffered serious losses, as the Russian defenders were well positioned to use hand grenades and machine guns against the tightly packed mass of Japanese soldiers. On November 30, a small party of Japanese succeeded in planting the Japanese flag at the summit of the hill, but by the morning of December 1, the Russians had successfully counterattacked. Still retaining the authority to replace Nogi if necessary, Kodama assumed temporary command of the Japanese <b>front-line</b> <b>forces,</b> but officially maintained the despondent Nogi in nominal command.|$|R
