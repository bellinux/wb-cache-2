40|$|Chlamydophila psittaci {{is one of}} {{the most}} important, {{zoonotic}} pathogen of birds causing chlamydiosis. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of infection by Cp. psittaci and to determine the genotype in birds at potential risk of exposure to this pathogen. In total four species of wild birds (50 native and 40 migratory quails, 30 <b>doves</b> and 25 <b>tree</b> sparrows) and four species of pet birds, (20 Budgerigars, 10 cockatiels, 3 finches, 5 love birds) were examined for the presense of Chlamydophila psittaci using impression smears stained with Giemsa stain, smears from yolk sacs were stained with Gimenez stain and PCR. The results were (80 %- 100 %), (85 %- 100 %) and (80 %- 100 %) in pet birds followed by wild birds (64 %- 85 %), (76 %- 95 %) and (80 %- 90 %), respectivelly The pathogencity of three isolates by intratracheal route with 106 TCID/ml in 15 days old chickens and quails was done and showed that the more pathogenic strain for chickens and quails was the pet birds strain. The observed clinical signs were respiratory signs, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea, While the pathological changes were congestion in liver, lung, spleen, and pericarditis while mild clinical and pathological changes were observed post infection by tree sparrows and migratory quails isolates. The partial ompA gene sequence of isolated Cp. psittaci strain was placed in genotype A of Cp. psittaci which had the highest identity (91. 9 - 94 %) with previously similar described strains of genotype A. Pet and wild birds were the major reservoir for Cp. psittaci which shed in their excreta and expose human and native birds to high zoonotic risk...|$|R

Ankang has a total of 430 kinds of wild animals, of which 34 were classified as national protective rare animals. Ankang is rich in Chinese herbal medicines, with more than 1290 kinds of species. The output of cocoon, Codonopsis pilosula, tea, raw Chinese lacquer, musk tops Shaanxi and the output of raw Chinese lacquer {{is well known in}} China. The development of Chinese herbal medicines mainly on Gynostemma pentaphylla, saponin and puerarin has formed industrial groups with certain size. Ankang's tea has a long production history, which is one of seven major tea-planted areas in China. There are 9 counties or districts produce tea, among which Ziyang, Liping, Hanbin, Langao, Han Yin and Shiquan are the main tea-producing areas. In 2006, the tea garden covered an area of 34.52 million mu in Ankang, with a total output of 4735 tons. Ankang is also the largest silkworm and silk production base in Shaanxi, even in the northwest of China whose cocoon output accounts for more than 80% of Shaanxi Province. Ankang is an important base for forest and animal husbandry. The grassland covers an area of 3,130,000 mu and the theoretical animal number of the grasslands is 3,120,000. The forest area is 1,993 mu and the forest coverage of Ankang is 56.5%. The stumpage has reached 55,540,000 cubic meters, accounting for 20.6% of Shaanxi's.|$|E
5000|$|After {{six months}} at Veitch's Coombe Woods Nursery, Wilson {{travelled}} west towards China, stopping {{for five days}} at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts, where he carried a letter of introduction to Charles Sprague Sargent and studied techniques for shipping seeds and plants without damage. He continued across the U.S. by train, and sailed from San Francisco, reaching Hong Kong on 3 June 1899. Sargent had suggested he head straight to Simao to talk to Augustine Henry, who had seen a unique <b>dove</b> <b>tree</b> twelve years previously. Though the tree had been recently cut down when Wilson reached it, he rediscovered the specimens noticed by Père David 600 km away in Yichang, Hubei. Wilson collected {{for two years in}} Hubei Province, reaching isolated mountain valleys with an intrepid spirit that has made him legendary, before returning to England in April 1902 with seed of 305 species, and 35 Wardian cases of bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers, many of which Veitch introduced into Western commerce, as well as dried herbarium specimens, representing some 906 plant species. On his first return Wilson married Helen Ganderton, of Edgbaston, but within six months Veitch sent him out again, this time with the yellow Chinese poppy, Meconopsis integrifolia as his objective. In 1903 Wilson discovered the Regal lily in western Sichuan along the Min River. He revisited the site in 1908 and collected more bulbs, but most of these rotted while en route back to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. In 1910 he again returned to the Min valley, but this time his leg was crushed during an avalanche of boulders as he was carried along the trail in his sedan chair. After setting his leg with the tripod of his camera, he was carried back to civilization on a three-day forced march. Thereafter he walked with what he called his [...] "lily limp". It was this third shipment of bulbs that successfully introduced the Regal Lily into cultivation in the United States.|$|E

40|$|In the {{surroundings}} of Prague, {{as well as}} in many other parts of Europe the population numbers of synanthropic species were reduced in recent years. These changes in abundance are attributed to the change of use of agricultural landscapes, the loss of small poultry farms and mainly a change in the character of the construction. The aim of this thesis was to ascertain the abundance of selected species of synanthropic birds and compared their numbers with the data obtained in 2012. In this study were also evaluated differences in the abundance of these species in the localities of old construction area and new construction area. There were selected 3 main leaders, house sparrow (Passer domesticus), tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) from all monitored species for the statistical processing of the results. Census was carried out in a total of 40 squares, 20 of which was located in an old construction area and 20 {{in the construction of the}} new. All of the site lies in an area with a high degree of suburbanization in the central region an in around of Prague. The study area covered an area of 200 x 200 meters and were visited a total of twice during the nesting period in the spring of 2015. The results show the preferences of the old buildings for the house sparrow and the eurasian collared <b>dove.</b> <b>Tree</b> sparrow was more numerous in the localities, characterizing the new housing development. For eurasion collared dove was observed increasing trend in abundance, while in both species of sparrows was recorded its decline.
