Local and general reactions following the vaccination were observed in the successive three to four days, and serum antibody responses for various influenza viruses were examined before and {{two weeks after the}} vaccination. Results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) Certain local and general reactions due to the vaccine were observed in both groups. Feverishness was a relatively prominent symptom in the infants. Headache, chilliness and slight local reactions were more marked in the adult groups than in the infants, but these reactions were generally mild and none of the subjects showed anaphylactic symptoms as a results of the vaccine. 2) The antibody responses to PR 8 and <b>FM</b> 1 <b>viruses</b> by the vaccination were outstandingly remarkable, whereas the response to the newly isolated influenza virus strain was less remarkable. The response to Lee virus was hardly noticeable in spite of the Lee antigen which should be present in sufficient quantity in the vaccine. 3) It was clearly recognized that the antibody response following the influenza vaccination was influenced not only by the potencies of the used vaccine, but also by the age of individuals, and antibody levels of the subjects before vaccination, as well as the strain of the virus antigen contained in the vaccine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe role of {{pre-existing}} immunity for {{influenza vaccine}} responses {{is of great}} importance for public health, and thus has been studied in various contexts, yet the impact of differential priming on vaccine responses {{in the midst of}} antigenic drift remains to be elucidated. To address this with antigenically related viruses, mice were first primed by either infection or immunization with A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) virus, then immunized with whole-inactivated A/Fort Monmouth/ 1 / 47 (<b>FM</b> 1) <b>virus.</b> The ensuing vaccine responses and the protective efficacy of FM 1 were superior in PR 8 infection-primed mice compared to PR 8 immunization-primed or unprimed mice. Increased FM 1 -specific Ab responses of PR 8 infection-primed mice also broadened cross-reactivity against contemporary as well as antigenically more drifted strains. Further, prior infection heightened the protective efficacy of antigenically distant strains, such as A/Brisbane/ 59 / 2006 infection followed by immunization with split pandemic H 1 N 1 vaccine (A/California/ 07 / 2009). Therefore, influenza infection is a significant priming event that intensifies future vaccine responses against drift strains...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{reproducible}} and scalable {{chemical method}} for fabrication of smooth graphene nanogrids {{has been reported}} which addresses the challenges of graphene nanoribbons (GNR). These nanogrids {{have been found to}} be capable of attomolar detection of biomolecules in field effect transistor (FET) mode. However, for detection of sub-femtomolar concentrations of target molecule in complex mixtures with reasonable accuracy, it is not sufficient to only explore the steady state sensitivities, but is also necessary to investigate the flicker noise which dominates at frequencies below 100 kHz. This low frequency noise is dependent on the exposure time of the graphene layer in the buffer solution and concentration of charged impurities at the surface. In this paper, the functionalization strategy of graphene nanogrids has been optimized with respect to concentration and incubation time of the cross linker for an enhancement in signal to noise ratio (SNR). It has been interestingly observed that as the sensitivity and noise power change at different rates with the functionalization parameters, SNR does not vary monotonically but is maximum corresponding to a particular parameter. The optimized parameter has improved the SNR by 50 % which has enabled a detection of 0. 05 <b>fM</b> Hep-B <b>virus</b> molecules with a sensitivity of around 30 % and a standard deviation within 3 %. Further, the SNR enhancement has resulted in improvement of quantification accuracy by five times and selectivity by two orders of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} <b>virus</b> (<b>FM</b> {{infection of}} domestic cats represents a valuable system {{through which to}} investigate criteria for antilentiviral vaccines in a natural host species. Here, we examined whether vaccination with a strain of FIV attenuated {{as a result of}} prolonged growth in vitro could protect against a fully virulent, highly heterologous intraclade challenge. The results indicated that the vaccine virus produced a low-grade infection with no detectable pathological effects and afforded a long-lasting sterilizing immunity if the challenge was delivered intraperitoneally as cell-free virus but not against a cell-associated intravaginal challenge. In the latter case, however, the replication and pathological consequences of the challenge virus were markedly suppressed. Together with similar results obtained in rhesus monkey models, these findings should give impulse to the development of attenuated FIV vaccines to be tested in controlled studies in field cats. Field studies may provide answers to some of the existing safety concerns surrounding attenuated AIDS vaccines in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of foot-and-mouth disease <b>virus</b> (<b>FM</b> DV) serotype C (clone C-S 8 c 1) with a strongly neutralising monoclona antibody (MAb) 4 C 4 {{has been studied}} by combining data from cryoelectron microscopy and x-ray crystallography. The MAb 404 binds to the exposed flexible GH-loop of viral protein 1 (VP 1), which appears to retain its flexibility, allowing movement of the bound Fab. This is in striking contrast to MAb SD 6, which binds to the same GH-loop of VP 1 but exhibits no movement of the bound lab when observed under identical conditions. However, MAbs 4 C 4 and SD 6 have very similar neutralisation characteristics. The known atomic structure of FM DV C-S 8 cl {{and that of the}} 4 C 4 Fab cocrystallised with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the GH-loop of VP 1 were fitted to the cryoelectron microscope density map. The best fit of the 4 C 4 Fab is compatible only with monovalent binding of the MAb in agreement with the neutralisation data on 404 MAbs, Fab 2 s, and labs. The position of the bound GH-loop is related to other known positions of this loop by a hinge rotation about the base of the loop. The 4 C 4 Fab appears to interact almost exclusively with the G-H loop of VP 1, making no other contacts with the viral capsid. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

To this end, six groups of five cattle were vaccinated with different <b>FMD</b> <b>virus</b> serotype A strain vaccines formulated with Montanide ISA 206 VG adjuvant. Antibody responses for homologous and heterologous cross-reactivity against a panel of 10 different <b>FMD</b> <b>virus</b> serotype A strains were tested by a liquid-phase blocking ELISA.

No significant effect of adjuvant on the breadth of the antibody response was observed, neither for mixing of antigens nor for the route of administration (subcutaneous vs. intradermal). Comparison of antigen payload, however, increased both homologous and heterologous titres; a 10 -fold higher antigen dose resulted in approximately four times higher titres against all tested strains.
