2500|$|The {{stations}} are generally white, Modernist structures, highly glazed and with large airy turbine halls. The designs were stylistically advanced {{for their time}} and {{can be viewed as}} some of Scotland's earliest modern buildings. The credit for the design is given to Alexander Gibb and Partners, however {{it seems likely that the}} design received input from H. O. Tarbolton, the architectural advisor to the scheme's 'Amenities Committee'. This committee was set up to [...] "make to the Company such recommendations as they may think are reasonable and proper for the preservation of the beauty of the scenery" [...] (from the 1929 Galloway water power act). Tarbolton was designer of the Pitlochry power station which bears some striking similarities to the Galloway turbine halls. Whilst no <b>direct</b> <b>credit</b> for the design work can be given to him, it is unlikely that he had no influence on the outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu {{has been}} {{described}} as 'the advocate of the free-market'. As Prime Minister in his first term, he significantly reformed the banking sector, removing barriers to investment abroad, mandatory purchases of government securities and <b>direct</b> <b>credit.</b> [...] As Minister of Finance (2003–2005), Netanyahu introduced a major overhaul of the Israeli economy. He introduced a welfare to work program, he led a program of privatization, reduced the size of the public sector, reformed and streamlined the taxation system and passed laws against monopolies and cartels with the aim of increasing competition. Netanyahu extended capital gains taxes from companies to individuals, which allowed him to enlarge the tax base while reducing taxes on incomes. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' {{by the end of his}} tenure. Direct investment in the Israeli economy had increased by an annualized 380%. On the other hand, his critics have labelled his economic views as Margaret Thatcher-inspired [...] "popular capitalism".|$|E
