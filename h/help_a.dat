50|$|A {{survey of}} more than 4,200 obstetrician-gynecologists {{affiliated}} with the Brazilian Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that the closer they were to a patient, the more they accepted legal abortion for that person: 41% had <b>helped</b> <b>a</b> patient to get an abortion, 49% had <b>helped</b> <b>a</b> relative, 78% of these female doctors had obtained abortions for themselves, and 80% of these male doctors had <b>helped</b> <b>a</b> partner to get an abortion. The figure was slightly lower for very religious doctors: only 70% of them had obtained abortions for themselves or their partners.|$|R

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may <b>help</b> <b>a</b> bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King <b>help</b> <b>a</b> {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} a {{creature}} of pure anti-magic. As such, the jewels from Ice King's crown are stripped of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by Tom Kenny). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players <b>help</b> <b>a</b> faction, their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a bad reputation may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might <b>help</b> <b>a</b> return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso Cuarón. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 {{novel of the}} same name, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must <b>help</b> <b>a</b> refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E

5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to <b>help</b> <b>a</b> rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E

The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.
