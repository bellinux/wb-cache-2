5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> efficient to gather food by {{working as a}} group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
30|$|Smaller {{diameter}} vessels, {{and deeper}} vessels <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> difficult to cannulate [428].|$|R
5000|$|... they <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{expensive}} than programmable logic, especially if high speed is required.|$|R
50|$|Modern OTLs <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> reliable, sound better, and {{are less}} {{expensive}} than many transformer-coupled valve approaches.|$|R
25|$|Exposure to {{bacteria}} <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> common during travelling, {{and therefore}} campylobacteriosis {{is a common}} form of travelers' diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC {{considered}} that achieving these reductions {{would require a}} 'large shift {{in the pattern of}} investment, although the net additional investment required ranges from negligible to 5-10%'.They also concluded that it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> cost effective to invest in end-use energy efficiency improvement than in increasing energy supply.|$|E
25|$|Duodenum: In {{patients}} with neuromuscular disorders, particularly {{progressive systemic sclerosis}} and visceral myopathy, the duodenum is frequently involved. There may be dilatation, which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> pronounced in the second, third and fourth parts. The dilated duodenum may be slow to empty and the grossly dilated, atonic organ may produce a sump effect.|$|E
50|$|Jobs on service rigs <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{stable than}} those on {{drilling}} rigs, because maintenance is an ongoing process.|$|R
50|$|Through these conditions, Galanter {{was able}} to show that human's sensory organs <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{sensitive}} than originally thought.|$|R
50|$|As {{this example}} shows, {{computations}} done with cellular homology <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> efficient than those calculated by using singular homology alone.|$|R
25|$|If {{the exact}} values of large factorials are needed, {{they can be}} {{computed}} using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications , a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> efficient.|$|E
25|$|In B. subtilis {{the length}} of the {{transferred}} DNA is greater than 1271 kb (more than 1 million bases). The length transferred is likely double stranded DNA and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{than a third of the}} total chromosome length of 4215 kb. It appears that about 7-9% of the recipient cells take up an entire chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Weed control methods vary {{according}} to the growth habit of the weeds in questions, as well as the context. For example, different methods of weed control may be used on a food crop versus a fiber crop or a golf course, because there <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> concern about health effects of chemicals used on food crops, because they are ingested.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to a tidal diamond is a tidal atlas which <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> accurate {{and easier to use}} (if available).|$|R
50|$|Their diets {{consist of}} small mammals, lizards, and {{sometimes}} frogs. They <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> active at colder temperatures than other rattlesnake species.|$|R
5000|$|You cannot rely on {{university}} {{to give you}} a complete and relevant education when professors <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> interested in researching than teaching.|$|R
25|$|Compared with {{protest and}} noncooperation, nonviolent {{intervention}} {{is a more}} direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> immediate and effective {{than the other two}} methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.|$|E
25|$|In Some Thoughts Concerning Education, John Locke (1693) {{argues that}} the purpose of {{education}} is to promote rational thinking. While personal journal writing has a long history in education settings as a way to promote reflective thinking, interactive writing in a dialogue journal not only promotes personal reflection but also reflection with another person, who <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> knowledgeable about the topics under consideration.|$|E
25|$|Although these {{treatments}} are very successful (in slowing or stopping further vision loss), {{they do not}} cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with laser surgery since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> prudent to inject triamcinolone or anti-VEGF drugs. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially {{if there is an}} edema of the macula.|$|E
50|$|The Sasak {{people of}} Lombok build lumbung, pile-built bonnet-roofed rice barns, that <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{distinctive}} and elaborate than their houses (see Sasak architecture).|$|R
50|$|The {{layout and}} routing {{of a typical}} {{manufacturing}} plant <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> complex, see for example figure III, but the principles remain the same.|$|R
50|$|Although {{digitization}} {{seems to}} be a promising area for future preservation, there are also problems. The main problems are that digital space costs money, formats change, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. Higher-quality images take a longer time to scan, but <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> valuable for future use. Fragile items <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> difficult or more expensive to scan, which creates a selection problem for preservationists. Other problems include scan quality, redundancy of digitized books among different libraries, and copyright law.|$|R
25|$|Phosphorus removal {{can also}} be {{achieved}} by chemical precipitation, usually with salts of iron (e.g. ferric chloride), aluminum (e.g. alum), or lime. This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals can be expensive. Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> reliable than biological phosphorus removal. Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular laterite.|$|E
25|$|After {{hysterectomy}} for benign indications {{the majority}} of women report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain. A smaller share of women report worsening of sexual life and other problems. The picture is significantly different for hysterectomy performed for malignant reasons; the procedure <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> radical with substantial side effects. A proportion of patients who undergo a hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain continue to suffer from pelvic pain after a hysterectomy and develop dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).|$|E
25|$|The {{person who}} is acting in a {{controlling}} way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> {{a matter of how}} they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{conditional}} raising processes of open front vowels. These processes <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> extreme than in Canada and the North Central United States.|$|R
50|$|After Sedding's {{death in}} 1891 Wilson {{completed}} many of Sedding's schemes. He followed Sedding's ideals, but his designs <b>were</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> original and grander in scale.|$|R
50|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs) have anxiolytic effects; however, {{side effects}} <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> troubling or severe and overdose is dangerous. Examples include imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline and desipramine.|$|R
25|$|An allergy {{blood test}} is quick and simple, {{and can be}} ordered by a {{licensed}} health care provider (e.g., an allergy specialist), GP, or PED. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity, and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can take an allergy blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> gentle than several skin tests.|$|E
25|$|Content {{subtitles}} are a North American Secondary Industry (non-Hollywood, often low-budget) staple. They add content dictation that {{is missing}} from filmed action or dialogue. Due to the general low-budget allowances in such films, it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> feasible to add the overlay subtitles to fill in information. They are most commonly seen on America's Maverick films as forced subtitles, and on Canada's MapleLeaf films as optional subtitles. Content subtitles also appear {{in the beginning of}} some higher-budget films (e.g., Star Wars) or {{at the end of a}} film (e.g., Gods and Generals).|$|E
25|$|Most {{sedimentary}} rocks contain either quartz (especially siliciclastic rocks) or calcite (especially carbonate rocks). In contrast to igneous and metamorphic rocks, a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals. However, {{the origin of}} the minerals in a sedimentary rock <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> complex than in an igneous rock. Minerals in a sedimentary rock can have formed by precipitation during sedimentation or by diagenesis. In the second case, the mineral precipitate can have grown over an older generation of cement. A complex diagenetic history can be studied by optical mineralogy, using a petrographic microscope.|$|E
50|$|Commercial vehicle {{accidents}} and injuries <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> complex than regular car accidents, often involving additional concerns, {{background checks on}} operator driving records, and corporate maintenance records.|$|R
50|$|Leaves <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> or less palmately lobed or palmately {{compound}} and always bear stipules. Cystoliths are always present and {{some members of}} this family possess laticifers.|$|R
50|$|The shoals <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>more</b> than 7 km long, 1.5 km {{wide and}} 30 metres deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes {{or from the}} surface.|$|R
