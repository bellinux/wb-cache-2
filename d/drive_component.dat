50|$|The {{magnetic}} sail {{was proposed}} by Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin working in collaboration in 1988. At that time, Andrews {{was working on}} a concept to use a magnetic scoop to gather ions to provide propellant for a nuclear electric ion drive spacecraft, allowing the craft to operate in the same manner of a Bussard ramjet, but without the need for a proton-proton fusion propulsion drive. He asked Zubrin to help him compute the drag that the magnetic scoop would create against the interplanetary medium. Zubrin agreed, but found that the drag created by the scoop would be much greater than the thrust created by the ion drive. He therefore proposed that the ion <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> of the system be dropped, and the device simply used as a sail. Andrews agreed, and the magsail was born. The two then proceeded to elaborate their analysis of the magsail for interplanetary, interstellar, and planetary orbital propulsion in a series of papers published from 1988 through the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{inspection}} {{has declined}} in importance as {{statistical process control}} has assumed a more prominent role in the quality function. However, product quality inspection is still an important task {{in the production of}} hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. In the case study company, which produces hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component,</b> inspection occurs at many points in a process. Inspectors perform 100 % inspection using microscope for many hours without adequate break. After continually monitoring the performance of inspectors, it was found that certain nonconformities were more difficult to find, the number of nonconformities reported was unusual, and inspectors varied in their abilities. Turnover rate of the quality inspection division in this company is high. Therefore, this research aims at determining the impact of working duration and resting time on reducing the mental fatigue in inspection task with microscope in the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. Five types of working duration and resting time were studied and compared using Randomized Complete Block Design of Experiment with two replicates. A variety of data collection tools were used to assist in the data collection. The data collection tools used included bipolar questionnaire, reaction time, and critical flicker frequency (CFF). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. The result showed that, the work-rest period type significantly affects the mental fatigue reduction as measured by questionnaire scores and reaction time. However, the work-rest period type significantly does not affect the mental fatigue reduction as measured by CFF...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested {{that the concept of}} Functional Impulsivity bears some similarity to the sensitivity of the Behavioral Activation System (BAS; Smillie & Jackson, 2006). In the present research we {{take a closer look at}} this idea, testing more specific hypotheses on the associations of different BAS-related components with Functional and Dysfunctional Impulsivity. Analyzing a sample of 719, we found that the <b>Drive</b> <b>component</b> was uniquely connected with Functional Impulsivity, and Fun Seeking was linked to both impulsivities, but more weakly so to Functional Impulsivity compared with Drive. Reward Responsiveness was unrelated to Impulsivity. Implications for the conceptualization of Functional Impulsivity and for a complex view of BAS-related functions are addressed.

40|$|Complex systems require their {{distinct}} {{components to}} function in a dynamic, integrated, and cooperative fashion. To accomplish this in current microfluidic networks, individual valves are often switched and pumps separately powered by using macroscopic methods such as applied external pressure. Direct manipulation and control at the single-device level, however, limits scalability, restricts portability, and hinders the development of massively parallel architectures that would take best advantage of microscale systems. In this article, we demonstrate that local geometry combined with a simple global field can not only reversibly <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> assembly but also power distinct devices in a parallel, locally uncoupled, and integrated fashion. By employing this single approach, we assemble and demonstrate the operation of check valves, mixers, and pistons within specially designed microfluidic environments.

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industries, process {{variation is}} known to be a major source of poor quality. As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two or more correlated variables (multivariate). The traditional statistical process control (SPC) charting schemes are known to be effective in monitoring aspect but nevertheless, they are lack of diagnosis. In recent years, the control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) schemes have been developed for solving this issue. Design consideration involved the modeling of manufacturing process data to select input representation based on raw data. Proper design of artificial neural network (ANN) model is important in developing an effective CCPR scheme. In this research, the multivariate model ANN pattern recognizer, namely Statistical Features – ANN was investigated in monitoring and diagnosing process variation in manufacturing of hard disc <b>drive</b> <b>component.</b> The finding suggests that the scheme was effective to be applied in various types of process variation such as loading error, offsetting tool, and inconsistent pressure in clamping fixture...|$|E
40|$|Transport in a {{one-dimensional}} symmetric device can {{be activated}} by {{the combination of}} thermal noise and a bi-harmonic drive. For the study case of an overdamped Brownian particle diffusing on a periodic one-dimensional substrate, we distinguish two apparently different bi-harmonic regimes: (i) Harmonic mixing, where the two drive frequencies are commensurate and {{of the order of}} some intrinsic dynamical relaxation rate. A comparison of new simulation results with earlier theoretical predictions shows that the analytical understanding of this frequency mixing mechanism is not satisfactory, yet; (ii) Vibrational mixing, where one harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> is characterized by a high frequency but finite amplitude-to-frequency ratio. Its effect on the device response to either a static or a low-frequency additional input signal is accurately reproduced by rescaling each spatial Fourier component of the substrate potential, separately. Contrary to common wisdom based on the linear response theory, we show that extremely high-frequency modulations can indeed influence the response of slowly (or dc) operated devices, with potential applications in sensor technology and cellular physiology. Finally, the mixing of two high-frequency beating signal is also investigated both numerically and analytically. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanisms}} underlying acute {{respiratory failure}} induced by respiratory loads are unclear. We hypothesized that, {{in contrast to}} a moderate inspiratory resistive load, a severe one would elicit central respiratory failure (decreased respiratory drive) before diaphragmatic injury and fatigue. We also wished to elucidate the factors that predict endurance time and peak tracheal pressure generation. Anesthetized rats breathed air against a severe load (~ 75 % of the peak tracheal pressure generated during a 30 s occlusion) until pump failure (fall in tracheal pressure to half; mean 38 min). Hypercapnia and hypoxemia developed rapidly (~ 4 min), coincident with diaphragmatic fatigue (decreased ratio of transdiaphragmatic pressure to peak integrated phrenic activity) and the detection in blood of the fast isoform of skeletal troponin I (muscle injury). At ~ 23 min, respiratory frequency and then blood pressure fell, followed immediately by secondary diaphragmatic fatigue. Blood taken after termination of loading contained cardiac troponin T (myocardial injury). Contrary to our hypothesis, diaphragmatic fatigue and injury occurred early in loading before central failure, evident only as a change in the timing but the not <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> of the central respiratory pattern generator.

One such component is the forward looking sonar (FLS) {{which can be}} used for obstacle avoidance and to extract vehicle state information. However, autonomous feature extraction of images from the FLS is difficult due to the noise inherent in the sensor and the sensor's susceptibility to interference from other acoustic devices. This thesis investigated techniques to detect and classify common acoustic noise artifacts and common objects in a single frame. Other techniques require three or more frames to filter objects from other noise sources. A combination of probabilistic and template-based models were used to successfully detect and classify acoustic noise and objects. One common noise source is the micro modem which was detected 100 % of the time with 1 % false positives. Objects such as the ocean floor were correctly classified more than 93 % of the time in most sites. Due to the short development time frame, the software was developed with a two-stage approach. First, a high level scripting language was used for rapid prototyping of different classification techniques. In order to meet the time-constrained requirements of the target software, the classification algorithms were encapsulated as C++ classes in an object oriented design once the desired techniques were identified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} a new measure of workaholism, the Workaholism Analysis Questionnaire (WAQ), which was developed to address the methodological flaws of existing measures. The WAQ is a unidimensional measure that focuses on the work <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> of workaholism and its effect on work-life balance. The current study used a heterogeneous, working-professional sample to ensure the generalizability of the results. The WAQ's content validity was displayed when 14 graduate students discerned the 30 WAQ items from a pool of 40 items 89 % of the time. In addition, the WAQ demonstrated discriminant validity by not correlating well with unrelated constructs, namely, the affective commitment and normative commitment subscales of Allen and Meyer's (1990) Three-Component Model of organizational commitment. Also, the WAQ showed concurrent validity by correlating well with a related construct, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). Finally, convergent validity was seen in that the WAQ correlated well with the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART), an existing and psychometrically sound measure of workaholism. In addition, a hierarchical regression analysis found that the WAQ explained incremental variance in OCPD beyond the WART. The development and validation of the WAQ is a substantial step in the right direction towards creating a unified definition of workaholism, as well as developing a reliable and valid measure for assessment purposes. Study limitations, directions for future research, and practical implications of this study are discussed.   M. A...|$|E
