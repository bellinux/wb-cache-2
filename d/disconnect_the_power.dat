50|$|Unlike {{electrical}} fuses {{or circuit}} breakers, thermal fuses only react to excessive temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> which eliminates <b>the</b> risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|R
50|$|A fuse {{contains}} a short piece of wire which melts if too much current flows. This effectively <b>disconnects</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply from its load, and the equipment stops working until {{the problem that}} caused the overload is identified and the fuse is replaced.Some power supplies use a very thin wire link soldered in place as a fuse. Fuses in power supply units may be replaceable by the end user, but fuses in consumer equipment may require tools to access and change.|$|R

5000|$|Electric shock drownings {{are most}} {{commonly}} caused by improper electrical connections on boats and docks. By law, all connections near water {{are required to}} have working ground fault circuit interruption technology, GFCI. These devices break the electrical circuit if any stray current fails {{to return to the}} source connection. If GFCI devices are missing or faulty, it is possible for current to leak into the water. If a system is leaking current into the water, appliances will likely function as normal without any indication of a problem. Correctly functioning GFCI and ELCI devices will instantaneously detect the problem and <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> source.|$|E
50|$|A {{short circuit}} fault current can, within milliseconds, be {{thousands}} of {{times larger than the}} normal operating current of the system. Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing fuses, circuit breakers, or other overload protection, which <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> in reaction to excessive current. Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit. Circuits for large home appliances require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits. Wire gauges specified in building and electrical codes are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum prospective short circuit current.|$|E
50|$|According to Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002), Cooper (2002), Tulloch (2002) and Soper (2004), on IBM PC {{compatible}} platform, a cold boot is a {{boot process}} in which the computer starts from a powerless state. All except Tulloch (2002) also mention that in cold boot, system performs a power-on self-test (POST). In addition to the power switch, Cooper (2002) and Soper (2004) also state that reset button may commence a cold reboot. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) contradicts this assertion and states that a reset button may commence either a cold or warm reboot, depending on the system. Microsoft Support article 102228 also confers that although the reset button is designed to perform a cold reboot, it may not <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to the motherboard - a state that does not correspond to the cold boot definition given above. According to Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002), both the operating system and third-party software can initiate a cold boot; the restart command in Windows 9x initiates a cold reboot, unless Shift key is held.|$|E
2500|$|All RCDs have a {{latching}} feature. [...] The latch becomes set {{when the}} device is armed - typically by moving a switch to the on position, or depressing a reset button. [...] Once armed, <b>the</b> device permits <b>power</b> to flow until some electrical event occurs that causes the latch to become un-set. [...] That trigger is normally intended to be the detection of a serious electrical irregularity, but un-latching can also occur by the disconnection of the power; such power-disconnection is not regarded as an irregular event, and includes such events as a user <b>disconnecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> intentionally or unintentionally, or a temporary power failure attributed to the electricity service provider.|$|R

5000|$|The federal {{government}} of the United States admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare. The United States Department of Homeland Security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the security of control system networks. The {{federal government}} is also working to ensure that security is built in as {{the next generation of}} [...] "smart grid" [...] networks are developed. In April 2009, reports surfaced that China and Russia had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid and left behind software programs {{that could be used to}} disrupt the system, according to current and former national security officials. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyber attack. China denies intruding into the U.S. electrical grid. One countermeasure would be to <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> grid from the Internet and run the net with droop speed control only. Massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a national trauma.|$|E

5000|$|Inverters {{generally}} {{track the}} phase of the grid signal using a phase locked loop (PLL) of some sort.

When <b>the</b> grid <b>disconnects,</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> factor suddenly changes from the grid's (1) to the load's (~1). As the circuit is still providing a current that would produce a smooth voltage output given the known loads, this condition will result in a sudden change in voltage. By the time the waveform is completed and returns to zero, the signal will be out of phase.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{distributed}} generators {{increase their}} importance on the electric power system, {{more and more}} parameters have to be controlled in order to assure the proper operation of the utility. One of the main problems encountered {{with this kind of}} generation is the potential formation of islands which could keep working in a normal way even if the utility grid has failed. Many methods have been developed to prevent this situation and they have been classified into three groups: passive, active and methods based on communication systems. This paper checks the validity of some of the active and passive anti-islanding methods. Some of them are shown to work properly with any kind of utility and local loads in the potential island. On the other hand, some others would not <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> generator when the total power of the local load fits that of the generator...|$|E

This system also makes use of a GSM module for remote monitoring and control of Energy Meter {{with the help of an}} interfacing circuitry. The Microcontroller based system continuously records the readings and the live meter reading can be sent to the Electricity department after a count period or on request. This system also can be used to <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply to the house in case of non-payment of electricity bills. The Substation will be the receiving end. The data received is fed to a microcontroller at the Substation which will automatically calculate the bill based on tariff provider and display it...|$|E

40|$|The mode {{transition}} from electric propulsion mode to hybrid propulsion mode is important {{with regard to}} the power management strategy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This is because mode transitions can occur frequently depending on the power management strategies and driving cycles, and because inadequate mode transitions worsen the fuel efficiency and drivability. A pre-transmission parallel PHEV uses a clutch between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the electric motor (EM) to connect or <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> source of the ICE for a mode transition. The mode transition requires additional energy consumption for clutch speed synchronization, and is accompanied by a drivetrain shock due to clutch engagement. This paper proposes a control strategy for the mode transition with gear-shifting to resolve the problems of energy consumption and drivetrain shock. Through the development of a PHEV performance simulator, we analyze the mode transition characteristics and propose a control strategy considering the vehicle acceleration and gear state. The control strategy reduces the duration required for the mode transition by moving the start time of the mode transition. This helps to improve energy efficiency while maintaining adequate drivability...|$|E
40|$|Electric Supply office {{sends the}} {{consumption}} {{bill for the}} previous month depending on the consumption {{as indicated by the}} conventional electric meter placed in a domestic premises or business place. The consumer then going to the electricity office, stands in front of a long queue to pay the bill. This process is very much cumbersome and hazardous and also very cost effective both for the suppliers and the users. Advance researches on energy meter develop many new and cost efficient technologies to construct energy meter that help {{at the same time to}} improve the billing system as well as the payment system. In this paper, a new concept on energy meter has been explained using power factor meter and instrument transformer using embedded technology. The proposed energy meter is smart enough also for billing and payment system. This meter can automatically <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> line with the meter circuit in the absence of any person in the room or in the office and thus is helpful in power saving. The proposed meter uses a pre-paid smart card. For the first time use, the consumer has to pay an amount according to the maximum demand and the smart card will be recharged accordingly. Then when the recharge value will be equal to the stop value, a warning is to be provided by the smart meter and the card is to be recharged again.

40|$|Abstract:In this {{research}} paper,the proposed concept is {{to replace the}} traditional manual meter reading. Now a days the traditional manual Meter Reading was not suitable for longer operating purposes as it spends much human and material resource. It brings additional problems in calculation of readings and billing manually. The number of Electricity consumers is increasing in great extent. It became a hard task in handling and maintaining the power as per the growing requirements. Presently maintenance of the power {{is also an important}} task as the human operator goes to the consumer’s house and produces the bill as per the meter reading. If the consumer is not available, the billing process will be pending and human operator again needs to revisit. Going to each and every consumer’s house and generating the bill is a laborious task and requires lot of time. It becomes very difficult especially in rainy season. If any consumer did not pay the bill, the operator needs to go to their houses to <b>disconnect</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply. These processes are time consuming and difficult to handle. Moreover, the manual operator cannot find the Un-authorized connections or malpractices carried out by the consumer to reduce or stop the meter reading/power supply. The human error can open an opportunity for corruption done by the human meter reader. So the problem which arises in the billing system can become inaccurate and inefficient. But, in this proposal greatly reduces the manpower, save time and operates efficiently without any human interference. And the person who is checking the amount electricity consumed by the user automatically using the microcontroller chip. Ou...|$|E
