5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight {{of these were}} also on the main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
5|$|The British {{also built}} three emplacements for breech-loading (BL) <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the fort's glacis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of 'A' and 'Y' turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the {{superstructure}} were removed during 1917 {{as well as}} the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Some of these guns were landed at Murmansk while she was based there. Seventeen 3-pounders were on board when she was lost in 1919, but it is unclear if that total includes the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E
50|$|Dronett confronted {{his wife}} with a <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> January 21, 2009. As she ran for safety, he turned the <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> himself. His death was ruled a suicide by the Gwinnett County Medical Examiner's office.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} Flower {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} 4-inch (102mm) <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the bow, depth charge racks carrying 40 charges on the stern, a minesweeping winch, and a 2-pounder (40mm) pom-pom <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a [...] "bandstand" [...] over the engine room.|$|R
50|$|The ship's main gun {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk V <b>guns</b> mounted fore-and-aft <b>on</b> the ship's centreline, with the forward <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a High-Angle (HA) anti-aircraft mounting and the aft <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a Low-Angle (LA) mounting, suitable only for use against surface targets. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ship's gun armament.|$|R
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the superstructure were removed during 1917 {{as well as}} the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets.

5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|Fort Montgomery, {{a massive}} masonry {{fortification}} mounting 125 <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> Lake Champlain {{was named for}} the General. Its construction begun in 1844, {{it was designed to}} guard the strategically important frontier between Canada and the United States; only ruins remain today.|$|E

5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed abaft the two-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> {{the forward}} turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews.

5|$|There {{they were}} {{blockaded}} until 14 April, when Cochrane removed this threat. A British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , landed {{troops on the}} islands capturing them. The British then installed heavy <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> vantage points.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E
5|$|As soon as A and B Squadrons of the 11th Light Horse Regiment {{reached the}} town and dismounted, the 4th Machine Gun Squadron stopped their {{covering}} fire, to target the German or Ottoman machine <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the right, which they silenced. Then the 4th Machine Gun Squadron galloped forward {{to take up a}} position at the western end of the town, while the two attacking squadrons dismounted, to approach the railway station buildings on foot.|$|E

5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|During her Royal Navy {{service as}} HMS President, she was {{initially}} rated at 50 guns, {{although she was}} at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E

5|$|President and Endymion {{continued}} to England, arriving at Spithead on 28March. President was commissioned into the Royal Navy {{under the name}} HMS President. Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the forecastle.

5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> the target, the turret crewmen {{had to follow}} pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E
