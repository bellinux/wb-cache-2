In experiment 2, mother-raised monkeys viewed similar techniques demonstrated by monkey models. A control group in each population saw no model. In both experiments, independent coders detected which technique experimental subjects had seen, thus confirming social learning. Further analyses examined copying at three levels of resolution.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the success}} of antipredator {{vigilance}} research, the specific focus of this vigilance {{has been difficult to}} determine. We have previously shown that thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) increase their vigilance when their lateral field of view is obstructed. In this paper, we describe an experiment in which we attempt to determine the predator class for which this vigilance is directed. Using six differentially occluded Plexiglas <b>foraging</b> <b>boxes</b> with hinged “eaves,” we were able to obstruct the squirrels’ view of the sky while not obstructing their view of terrestrial threats. In general, across the box types, when their sky view was obstructed, ground squirrels increased their vigilance by increasing the percentage of time spent withdrawn from the boxes. This result suggests that a significant portion of ground squirrel antipredator vigilance is directed at the sky and is surveillance for aerial predators...|$|R
40|$|Field reports {{suggest that}} orangutans acquire local traditions by observing {{neighbouring}} conspecifics. However, {{there is little}} direct evidence of social learning to support this conclusion. The present study investigated whether orangutans would learn a novel foraging method through observation of a conspecific in a diffusion-chain paradigm testing for {{the spread of the}} behaviour. A <b>foraging</b> <b>box</b> with two possible methods for extracting food was used to investigate the transmission of a foraging tradition among zoo-living subjects. In a socially housed group of five orangutans, the dominant male was trained to use one technique exclusively to retrieve food. He then performed this technique in the presence of another group member, who was then allowed to forage. After several trials, the observer became the model for the next individual. A second experimental group of six individuals was introduced to the alternative method. The model-seeded technique was successfully transmitted along both experimental chains, with significant preferences for the model method. These results are consistent with claims for social transmission of foraging methods in wild orangutans...|$|R

The time and number of boxes needed to find both fish decreased significantly throughout consecutive trials. Two additional controls were conducted to investigate the role of the acoustic signal: (i) tags were placed in one box, with no fish present in any boxes and (ii) additional pieces of fish, inaccessible to the seal, were placed in the previously empty 18 boxes, making possible alternative chemosensory cues less reliable.

40|$|I used differentially-occluded Plexiglas® <b>foraging</b> <b>boxes</b> {{containing}} {{peanut butter}} {{to manipulate the}} visual obstruction presented to free-ranging ground squirrels in five of six described experiments. Adult ground squirrels greatly increased their vigilance when their lateral field of view is obstructed, especially their long-range, lateral field of view.

The squirrels increased their vigilance, thus indicating that being able to view the sky is an important predation risk variable. When visual obstruction and distance to nearest burrow were manipulated together, the ground squirrels appeared to base most of their antipredator decisions upon the visual obstructiveness of the box. Although I did not find a distance effect upon vigilance (0. 5 2 ̆ 6 5 m), trial duration decreased as distance to burrow increased. Since the squirrels had behavioral control over trial duration, they incurred a foraging cost in lost food, but spent less time exposed to predators. ^ I also manipulated the cost of performing antipredator vigilance (in the form of travel time) and found that the squirrels actually decreased vigilance as box length increased. This was despite the appearance that the longer boxes were perceived as places of higher risk. ^ Juvenile ground squirrels were found to be much less vigilant than adult ground squirrels. I tested to see if the increased foraging demands of juveniles was significantly associated with their decreased vigilance by supplementing two groups of juveniles, one with peanut butter and oats, and another with lettuce. Over a short period of supplementation, videotape analysis of squirrel time budgets showed that juveniles that received peanut butter and oats exhibited adult-like levels of vigilance, while the other group of juveniles exhibited very low vigilance and displayed an apparent negative trend in vigilance over time. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores social {{learning}} in mother-reared and “enculturated” capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella). At the outset {{a framework for}} understanding the social influence on learning is discussed, followed by {{a review of the}} social and cognitive abilities of capuchin monkeys, establishing the rationale for studying {{social learning}} in this species. Studies of wild capuchins suggest an important role for social learning but experiments with captive subjects have generally failed to support this. Some potential reasons for the lack of evidence in experimental settings are given. An example of using the two - method design to test social learning in acquiring behaviour by enculturated subjects is addressed. The results are related to findings with other species tested with a similar apparatus. Before testing mother-reared monkeys, an observational study of the object manipulation and tool-use repertoire of the subjects was carried out in order to facilitate the design of suitable social learning tasks for these monkeys. The first empirical study in Chapter 6 reports results of experiments with the enculturated and mother-reared capuchin monkeys employing the two -action method together with a third control group. The enculturated monkeys exhibited high fidelity copying that included the specific tool use technique witnessed while opening the <b>foraging</b> <b>box.</b> Mother-reared monkeys exhibited fidelity at a lower level, tending only to re-create the results the model had achieved. The second empirical study in Chapter 7 tested whether capuchin monkeys could show cumulative cultural learning manifested in the ability to switch from an established mode of manipulating a dipping box to a complex yet more advantageous one. Both populations were able to do so. The enculturated monkeys, as in the previous study, showed higher fidelity copying of the model. The last experiment was a preliminary study employing the “do as I do” method which was carried out with four of the enculturated monkeys. It provides suggestive evidence for at least one monkey's understanding of the task. The results of the studies are discussed in relation to previous experimental research as well as to data from capuchin monkeys in nature. The possible role of enculturation in social learning ability is considered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Weaver ants {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} examples of social cooperation in nature. However, there are few studies to date on the particular aspects of their social behavior. In this study, we describe the behavioral repertory of Camponotus (Myrmobrachys) senex, a Neotro-pical weaver ant. A colony collected in the field was transferred to the laboratory for elaboration of an ethogram. Part of the colony: 20 wingless queens, 176 workers, 7 pupae, 30 larvae and 667 eggs, was conditioned in test tubes and put into two plastic boxes. One box was designated as nesting area and the other as <b>foraging</b> area. Both <b>boxes</b> were connected to each other. The ethogram was based on 20 hours of qualitative observations, followed by 50 hours of quantitative behav-ioral observations, “all occurrence sample ” method (sensu Altmann 1974). We identified 58 different behaviors (30, 651 registers), distrib-uted in 10 behavioral categories. The most frequent categories were: immobility (0. 4031 %), grooming (0. 1393 %), exploration (0. 1306 %) and brood care (0. 1035 %). Immobility was the most frequent category in all castes and we suggest that immobility might be an energy saving strategy in C. senex. Workers displayed a more diversified behavioral repertoire with 57 different acts whereas, queens displayed 34 different acts. The use of male larvae by weaving nests can suggest an additional function for males, in addition to their usual sexual role. It is hoped that new taxonomic and behavioral studies will be carried out in order to obtain a better understanding of labor division in C. senex. Our results provide baseline data for future comparisons about evolutionary patterns in nest building behavior in ants as well as to the study of the genus Camponotus as a whole...|$|R
40|$|PMCID: PMC 3987177 INTRODUCTION: The {{computational}} {{demands of}} sociality (maintaining group cohesion, reducing conflict) and ecological problems (extractive foraging, memorizing resource locations) {{are the main}} drivers proposed to explain the evolution cognition. Different predictions follow, about whether animals would preferentially learn new tasks socially or not, but the prevalent view today is that intelligent species should excel at social learning. However, the predictions were originally used to explain primate cognition, and studies of species with relatively smaller brains are rare. By contrast, domestication has often led to a decrease in brain size, which could affect cognition. In domestic animals, the relaxed selection pressures compared to a wild environment could have led to reduced social and physical cognition. Goats possess several features commonly associated with advanced cognition, such as successful colonization of new environments and complex fission-fusion societies. Here, we assessed goat social and physical cognition as well as long-term memory of a complex two-step <b>foraging</b> task (food <b>box</b> cognitive challenge), in order to investigate {{some of the main}} selection pressures thought to affect the evolution of ungulate cognition. RESULTS: The majority of trained goats (9 / 12) successfully learned the task quickly; on average, within 12 trials. After intervals of up to 10 Â months, they solved the task within two minutes, indicating excellent long-term memory. The goats did not learn the task faster after observing a demonstrator than if they did not have that opportunity. This indicates that they learned through individual rather than social learning. CONCLUSIONS: The individual learning abilities and long-term memory of goats highlighted in our study suggest that domestication has not affected goat physical cognition. However, these cognitive abilities contrast with the apparent lack of social learning, suggesting that relatively intelligent species do not always preferentially learn socially. We propose that goat cognition, and maybe more generally ungulate cognition, is mainly driven by the need to forage efficiently in harsh environments and feed on plants that are difficult to access and to process, more than by the computational demands of sociality. Our results could also explain why goats are so successful at colonizing new environments...|$|R
