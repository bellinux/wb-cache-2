6000|$|... "Don't they, Carrie? I {{am not so}} sure of that. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> {{of women}} who are always nagging their husbands, and giving them no peace of their lives. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of women who think of nothing but dress, and who go about and leave their homes and {{children}} to shift for themselves. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of women who spend all their time spreading scandal. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nay, certainly, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the Ptolemies' pyramises [...] {{are very}} goodly things; without contradiction, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> [...] that.|$|R

5|$|At the RV park, Mulder finds Ronnie. As {{he tries}} to arrest him, Mulder is {{surrounded}} and overwhelmed {{by a group of}} people with glowing green eyes. He wakes up the next morning in the RV park, in his car, where he is rejoined by Scully. They are both unharmed and the vampires have disappeared. Back in Washington, they give their unified report to Skinner, who is dumbfounded by what he <b>has</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boomblehardt then {{meets with}} the old woman.

5|$|Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner {{production}} contain {{portions of}} dialogue that, according to Hischak, {{speak to the}} power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of Carousel on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he <b>has</b> <b>heard).</b> The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cut {{your coat}} {{according}} to your cloth,' I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of that too; and I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of 'Burning a candle at both ends.'" ...|$|R

5|$|It {{is based}} in the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing the {{building}} with the Hague Academy of International Law, a private centre {{for the study of}} international law. The ICJ's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, ethnic cleansing, and other issues. The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} formed when the District of Missouri {{was divided into}} East and West in 1857, and its {{boundaries}} have changed little since that division. In its history it <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> {{a number of important}} cases that made it to the United States Supreme Court, covering issues related to freedom of speech, abortion, property rights, and campaign finance. There are currently nine active judges, five judges in senior status, and seven magistrate judges attached to the court.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

6000|$|... "England. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of England, and Dunwich; I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of Dunwich. Indeed, I travel thither, {{having an}} {{appointment}} with an old friend in that town." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really!" [...] said Lady Rossiter. [...] "Then {{you must}} <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of my husband. Everyone who knows {{anything}} about beetles must <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of Sir Thomas Rossiter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of you,” says Mr. Addison, with a smile; as, indeed, {{everybody}} about town <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that unlucky {{story about}} Esmond’s dowager aunt and the duchess.|$|R

5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} the guise of a comic book; FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{receives}} a letter from Shaineh Berkowitz (Pattie Tierce), a single mother who claims to have been mysteriously impregnated, while unconscious, by an unknown presence 18years ago, resulting in the birth of her son, Izzy (Stewart Gale). Now, following a similarly unexplained attack, she is pregnant again. She <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> about Mulder's expertise in the paranormal from The Jerry Springer Show and wants him to investigate. Mulder and his partner, special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), travel to rural Albion, Indiana. They meet Shaineh and her son Izzy and learn that the description of the creature that attacked her, with a lumpy head and two mouths, is very similar to a comic book character invented by Izzy. His monstrous creation, called The Great Mutato, is inspired by a mysterious creature that has been seen by many of the locals. Izzy and his friends take the agents to a wooded area where they see Mutato (Chris Owens) from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E

6000|$|... "You must <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of the ball," [...] {{said the}} steward, pompously; [...] "the poorest people in Pisa <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of it. It is {{the talk of}} the whole city." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, that word--taxes, taxes, taxes! I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it to-night. I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> it all night. I wish {{somebody}} would change that subject; {{that is a}} very sore subject to me.|$|R
5|$|Jeremy travels back to {{the ruins}} from the {{beginning}} of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan {{approaches}} Toomes in prison. Gargan <b>has</b> <b>heard</b> that Toomes knows Spider-Man's real identity, but Toomes denies this.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you may <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of what <b>has</b> occurred, Lady Rowley. It is natural, however, to suppose that you must <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> me spoken of with censure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of no rapparees in this neighbourhood, Walter," [...] she said. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of sad excesses in {{some parts}} of the country, but nothing in this neighbourhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly unfortunate. We <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of {{your good}} fortune on the seas--how your luck has passed into a byword. And we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> other things: of your good fortune in other directions." ...|$|R
