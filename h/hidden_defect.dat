40|$|AbstractAerospace {{structures}} often contain multi-layered metallic components where hidden defects such as fatigue {{cracks and}} localized disbonds can develop, necessitating non-destructive testing. Employing standard wedge transducers, high frequency guided ultrasonic waves that penetrate through the complete thickness were generated {{in a model}} structure consisting of two adhesively bonded aluminium plates. Interference occurs between the wave modes during propagation along the structure, resulting in a frequency dependent variation of the energy through the thickness with distance. The wave propagation along the specimen was measured experimentally using a laser interferometer. Good agreement with theoretical predictions and two-dimensional finite element simulations was found. Significant propagation distance with a strong, non-dispersive main wave pulse was achieved. The interaction of the high frequency guided ultrasonic waves with small notches in the aluminium layer facing the sealant and on the bottom surface of the multilayer structure was investigated. Standard pulse-echo measurements were conducted to verify the detection sensitivity {{and the influence of}} the stand-off distance predicted from the finite element simulations. The results demonstrated the potential of high frequency guided waves for <b>hidden</b> <b>defect</b> detection at critical and difficult to access locations in aerospace structures from a stand-off distance...|$|E
40|$|Statistical energy {{functions}} are discrete (or stepwise) energy functions that lack van der Waals repulsion. As a result, {{they are often}} applied directly to a given structure (native or decoy) without further energy minimization being performed to the structure. However, the full benefit (or <b>hidden</b> <b>defect)</b> of an energy function cannot be revealed without energy minimization. This paper tests a recently developed, all-atom statis-tical energy function by energy minimization with a fixed secondary helical structure in dihedral space. This is accomplished by combining the statistical energy function based on a distance-scaled finite ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) state with a simple repul-sive interaction and an improper torsion energy function. The energy function was used to minimize 2000 random initial structures of 41 small and medium-sized helical pro-teins in a dihedral space with a fixed helical region. Results indicate that near-native structures for most studied proteins {{can be obtained by}} minimization alone.

Induction thermography {{is used for}} surface defect detection in forged parts of ferromagnetic steel at typical frequencies of 100 – 300 kHz. The sensitivity for crack detection is comparable to magnetic particle inspection. A <b>hidden</b> <b>defect</b> in ferritic steel {{with a coverage of}} 140 μm was detected by lowering the induction frequency down to 1500 Hz. Defects of fibres were detected in carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). Inductive excitation is complementary to flash excitation. By increasing the induction frequency up to 52 MHz, surface heating of CFRP can be realised. Cracks in silicon solar cells were detected. The crack tip is revealed with very high contrast. A new field is crack detection in railway components like rails and wheels. In rails, a larger defect could be detected from a test car moving at a speed of up to 15 km/h. A fully automated wheel testing system was built up as a demonstrator, that can detect defects with comparable sensitivity to magnetic particle testing.

40|$|In {{order to}} detect the hidden defects of the solar cells, the eletroluminescence image was {{obtained}} by applying a certain forward bias voltage to solar cell in the darkroom using the light sensor CCD camera. The experiments were carried out at three states: without optical filter, filtering the wavelength less than 800 nm, and filtering the wavelength greater than 800 nm.

40|$|The {{paper has}} been {{intended}} {{to introduce a}} probabilistic method to estimate – {{from the standpoint of}} fatigue – the risk of a catastrophic failure to rotating (moving) members of an aircraft engine, i. e. to compressor blades. It has been assumed that there is a <b>hidden</b> <b>defect</b> in the material’s structure, which initiates a small-size crack. Load-affected, the crack keeps growing. The crack propagation dynamics, when approached in a deterministic way, remains consistent with the Paris formula. The crack growth is effected by some random load characterised with the servicing load spectrum. While determining the load spectrum, all possible operational events are taken into account, excluding ones that could result in an immediate damage to the component. It has been assumed that random instances of load increase, which may result in an immediate damage, compose a separate set of events; hence, they have not been taken into account in this model. A partial differential equation of the Fokker-Planck type has been used to describe randomly approached dynamics of crack propagation. Having solved this equation enables a density function of the fatigue crack length to be found. This function, in turn, has been used to determine the risk of a catastrophic failure to a compressor blade. Furthermore, this function {{can also be used to}} find safe service life of the structure under consideration...|$|E

Although real-life objects especially in aerospace, transport or cultural heritage are not flat (e. g. aircraft leading edges or sculptures), their inspection with shearography {{is of interest}} for both <b>hidden</b> <b>defect</b> detection and material characterization. Accurate strain measuring of a highly curved or free form surface needs to be performed by combining inline object shape measuring and processing of shearography data in 3 D.

40|$|Karl Marx’s labor {{theory of}} value {{has been on}} the {{periphery}} of the economic thought for already more than 100 years. Being a follower of Ricardo D., who, as many believe, never adhered to the labor theory of value (his theory is often called 93 % theory of labor value), Marx contended that product value is defined in full by the quantity of invested labor. Presence of capital in manufacturing process should not embarrass anybody: it constitutes paid labor of the creation of instruments of labor, equipment, erections, and the last thought causes no doubts. At such an approach the profit of capitalists and businessmen can be obtained only by way of exploitation, in other words, by the appropriation of a part of the labor. Marx was subjected to severe criticism as early as during his lifetime, the most successful example of the criticism being works by Bohm-Bawerk E. V., on which we are going to dwell later. But other theories, including contemporary ones, suffer from the same shortcomings. Profit is interpreted as payment for a specific production factor “entrepreneurial talent” and is a reward for efficient resources use. Entrepreneurial activity is connected with an extremely high risk and nothing guarantees adequate payback. All this arouses no doubt. But all theories have one <b>hidden</b> <b>defect.</b> The paradox is in the following: if salary is only a part of end value of a product (even if 93 % of the value), then how comes that all end products are bought. All workers’ salary is clearly insufficient to buy out all products and services. If one assumes that all the profit is also directed at the purchase of product manufactured, then where is here a place for savings and investments, which we observe in the real world. Savings must be made from workers’ available funds, and those are definitely not enough. How to solve the existing paradox?...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Infection {{courts for}} {{microorganisms}} invading white fir heartwood {{were determined to}} be primarily branches and basal wounds. Of 11 hymenomycetes isolated from infected trees, only four: Echinodontiurn tinctorium, Phellinus chrysoloma, Pholiota adiposa, and Hericium abietis were of major significance in terms of frequency of infection and damage caused. Two or more hyrnenomycetous fungi were commonly isolated from a single decay column. Where this occurred decay was more extensive than that caused by a single hymenomycete. Hericium abietis was a common associate of F. tinctorium and other hymenomycetes. Decay columns in white fir were typically cylindrical in shape and had three distinct zones of discoloration and deterioration. These included advanced, incipient and early decay. The progression of decay stages horizontally across the grain and vertically at the lower and upper ends of columns was from the advanced zone at the center through incipient to early decay to sound wood. Results of cultural isolation of microorganisms from the decay zones indicated that a succession of microorganisms occurs as decay progresses in white fir heartwood. Bacteria were the primary organisms isolated from the early decay zone. A consistent microflora of bacteria and fungi was isolated from the incipient and advanced stages of decay. Bacteria apparently are the initial colonizers of heartwood followed by the fungi. The hymenomycetous fungi responsible for causing 173 of the 513 decay columns were either unidentifiable in culture or in most cases they were not isolated. These decay columns were small, the causal fungi appeared to have died or become inactive. Limiting factors {{are thought to be}} competition by other microorganisms or unfavorable air or moisture conditions accompanying healing of infection courts. Non-hymenomycetes identified included: Phialophora fastigiata and Phialophora spp., Cladosporium herbarum, Gliocladium roseum, and Rhinocladiella atrovirens. No successional pattern was detected among those identified. Most bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. A few Bacillus species were found. Species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from decay in 31 white fir trees distributed among 16 areas. Evidence of N 2 - fixation by these bacteria was initially obtained by acetylene reduction then confirmed by use of 15 N 2 and by total nitrogen analyses. Bacteria fixing N 2 were associated with the major decay fungi during all stages of attack on the white firs. High populations (1 O^ 5 to 10 ^ 6 /ml expressed sap) of N 2 -fixing bacteria were associated with the early and incipient stages of decay caused by P. chrysoloma and H. abietis, but not E tinctorium Population data are considered preliminary because of the limited sample. Many of these bacteria were identified as typical or atypical isolates of Enterobacter agglomerans, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae and Kiebsiella pneurnoniae. Identifications based on phenotypic properties were confirmed by percent guanine plus cytosine base composition analyses of selected isolates. Phenotypic properties of many N 2 -fixing bacteria did not conform with published descriptions. Since most differences were negative responses none of the aberrant strains were considered new species. Two methods were developed for estimating defect in standing white fir trees in southwestern Oregon (1) Defect percentages of gross merchantable volumes (Scribner and International board-foot and cubic-foot) are tabulated by d. b. h and age. Then constant defect percentages are added for various indicators. Multiple regression equations used to derive the indicator defect percentage tables are given. (2) Average length deductions below and above various indicators are given along with flat percentage factors for <b>hidden</b> <b>defect.</b> The first method was considered to be the most accurate and objective. Statistical analysis indicated that the first method can be used to estimate defect in white fir in three cover types in which this species occurs in southwestern Oregon...|$|E
