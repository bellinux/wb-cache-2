50|$|At the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly met a {{professor}} named H. Cuthbert Bazett, a protege of British physiologist J. B. S. Haldane. Bazett introduced Lilly to Haldane's view that a scientist should never conduct an experiment or procedure on another person {{that they had}} not first conducted on themselves, a view that Lilly would embrace and attempt to exemplify throughout his career. Bazett took a liking to the young, enthusiastic graduate student, and set Lilly up with his own research laboratory. While working under Bazett, Lilly created his first invention, the electrical capacitance <b>diaphragm</b> <b>manometer,</b> a device for measuring blood pressure. While designing the instrument, he received electrical engineering advice from biophysics pioneer Britton Chance. Chance would also introduce Lilly to the world of computers, which was still in its infancy.|$|E
40|$|The {{energetic}} and structural study of three diphenylpyridine isomers {{is presented in}} detail. The three isomers, 2, 6 -, 2, 5 -, and 3, 5 -diphenylpyridines, were synthesized via Suzuki-Miyaura methodology based on palladium catalysis, and the crystal structures of the isomers were obtained by X-ray diffraction. The relative energetic stabilities in the condensed and gaseous phases as well as volatilities and structures of the three studied isomers were evaluated, regarding {{the position of the}} phenyl groups relative to the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring. The temperature, standard molar enthalpies, and entropies of fusion were measured and derived by differential scanning calorimetry. The vapor pressures of the considered isomers were determined by a static apparatus based on a MKS capacitance <b>diaphragm</b> <b>manometer.</b> The standard molar enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs energies of sublimation, at T) 298. 15 K, were derived, and the phase diagram near the triple point coordinates were determined for all isomers. The standard (p Â°) 0. 1 MPa) molar enthalpies of combustio...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} underlying {{a ceramic}} capacitive <b>diaphragm</b> gauge (CDG) <b>manometer</b> {{has been investigated}} {{for use as a}} microbalance for measurement of dust accumulation in next-step fusion devices such as ITER. Initial trials have confirmed in principle the use of CDG devices as dust microbalances and both the gauge head and electronics have been adapted to address the environmental constraints. Remote electronics, capable of controlling the gauge at a distance of 30 m, have been developed and a prototype device has been tested in the laboratory, where a sensitivity of 500 mu g/cm(2) and dynamic range of at least 10 (3) were demonstrated. The work shows that this approach is a promising contender to measure dust accumulation in next-step fusion devices. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
