500|$|In 2002–03, McGrady won {{his first}} scoring title and, behind averages of 32.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game, {{finished}} a career-best fourth in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting. ESPN later ranked his season {{one of the best}} ever for a perimeter player. In Game 1 of the playoffs, he scored 43 points to help Orlando take an early series lead against the top-seeded Detroit Pistons. The Magic would go on to take a commanding 3–1 lead, and McGrady made headlines when he prematurely assumed that Orlando were guaranteed to advance to the next round, replying in an interview, [...] "It feels <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in the second round." [...] Despite holding the series lead, the Magic were eliminated in seven games.|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that out of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back on the old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E

500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the 2007–08 season but in July 2008 joined West Bromwich Albion on a four-year contract for a £3.25million fee, possibly rising to £3.75million, with an option for the club to extend the contract by another year. Carson, who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004, explained that he wanted to get settled at one club, saying [...] "I've been like a nomad for three or four years. It'll be <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some roots and hopefully settle. I can see myself here for four or five years, even longer." [...] He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal in the opening match of the 2008–09 Premier League season. Despite relegation to the Championship Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy. West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League, finishing second, 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 matches. He had been playing regular football for the Midlands club, but in the 2010–11 season, his form seemed to dip and in January 2011, Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill. After the appointment of Roy Hodgson as West Bromwich Albion head coach, he swiftly found himself back in favour at The Hawthorns.|$|E

Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel <b>good.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002–03, {{with the}} {{acquisitions}} of Gordan Giricek and Drew Gooden from the Memphis Grizzlies {{in exchange for}} Mike Miller, McGrady once again led the Magic to a 42–40 record.
