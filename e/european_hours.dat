40|$|When {{arbitrage}} related prices {{share the}} same underlying asset, there are multiple channels to incorporate new information on the fundamental value of the asset. In this paper, we present an empirical microstructure model to characterize each channel’s price discovery speed. We identify the information sources of price adjustments to separate price discovery from the market responses to liquidity shocks. We assess market efficiency of price discovery visually, by the time paths of price convergence toward the new fundamental value, and numerically, by the magnitude of pricing errors during the price discovery process. We also use our price discovery model to illustrate the structural determinants of two often used price discovery measures: the information share and component share. We show that two measures are static and unable to reveal the underlying price discovery dynamics between markets. Applying our new measures to quotes from spot foreign exchange rates, we find that substantial price discovery of the yen/euro exchange rate occurs through the US dollar. The dollar’s price discovery contribution is positively related to the relative liquidity of the dollar markets versus the cross rate market, and reaches a minimum during the <b>European</b> business <b>hours...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractCloud {{computing}} is {{the delivery}} of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network (typically the Internet). Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid. Cloud computing, or in simpler shorthand just “the cloud”, also focuses on maximizing {{the effectiveness of the}} shared resources. Cloud resources are usually not only shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated per demand. This can work for allocating resources to users. For example, a cloud computer facility that serves European users during <b>European</b> business <b>hours</b> with a specific application (e. g., email) may reallocate the same resources to serve North American users during North America's business hours with a different application (e. g., a web server). This approach should maximize the use of computing power thus reducing environmental damage as well since less power, air conditioning, rack space, etc. are required for a variety of functions. With cloud computing, multiple users can access a single server to retrieve and update their data without purchasing licenses for different applications. Proponents claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a “pay as you go” model. This can lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing mode...|$|R

Given the vicissitudes of Alsatian political history, it would indeed seem that local movements tend to encourage their convergence, in order to assert their role as actors in the defence of French interests and/or Alsatian characteristics. This very question can be addressed from different points of view, such as interreligious relationships, or relationships between private initiatives and public policy, or the region/nation dialectic. It is these third issue which is particularly interesting here.

40|$|A two-month field {{campaign}} {{was carried out}} from May to June 2010 at a remote site (Trisaia ENEA Research Centre) in the Southern Italy aiming to identify and quantify the changes of aerosol chemical composition {{in the presence of}} Saharan dust. The 24 -hr PM 10 and PM 2. 5 filter samples were analyzed by mass, carbonaceous species, inorganic ions and elemental composition. Saharan dust transport events were identified with two approaches: one recommended by EC (2011) and one based on indicators derived from measurements. Three indicators were used: PM 2. 5 /PM 10 mass concentrations ratio, Ca/Al ratio and Al concentration. Based on these criteria, four Saharan dust transport events were identified, but only one had elevated dust concentration and leaded to an exceedance of the <b>European</b> short-term (24 <b>hour)</b> limit value of 50 µg/m 3 for PM 10 (June 16 th). The comparison of chemical composition of fine and coarse aerosol fractions during dust and non-dust conditions shows that the presence of dust increases NH 4 and nssSO 4 concentrations in the fine fraction and NO 3 and nssSO 4 concentrations in the coarse fraction. OC and EC concentrations also increase in the fine fraction during dust transport. The uptake of primary and secondary species, inorganic and organic, by dust particles changes their composition and, thus, their properties and this may have implications for human health and climate change...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{management}} of working time flexibility and firm performance, measured by operating hours, in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in Europe. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses the European Capital Operating time, Work and Employment Survey (EUCOWE), designed to collect workplace information on operating hours. With data on more than 17, 000 establishments in six European countries – France, Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK – the paper analyses working time patterns and operating hours. Findings – The authors show the positive relationship between company size and operating times and how SMEs make more limited use of more advanced forms of working-time organisation that may allow them to extend their operating hours. The use of less complex working time measures such as overtime does not have the same positive association with operating hours. However, the results also highlight that smaller establishments can still benefit from the adoption of certain working time practices. The results suggest that the influence of the regulatory environment on the use of working practices or the duration of operating hours is not straightforward, and as such the impact of national regulatory frameworks cannot be discounted in the country-specific differences identified. Originality/value – The paper uses the first comparable data on operating hours and working patterns to demonstrate the limitations on SME operating times across <b>European</b> countries.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the trends and {{root causes of}} extreme working hours in sixteen Western European countries, Canada, and the United States between 1970 and 2010. Earlier literature has revealed increasing trends in extreme working hours in the United States and recognized the negative repercussions of this new aspect of labor market polarization. As <b>European</b> average working <b>hours</b> have declined over the past decades, scholars have turned {{little attention to the}} analysis of extreme working <b>hours</b> in <b>European</b> countries. First, the article documents diverging patterns of extreme working hours in Western Europe. Whereas the Scandinavian and French ratios of workers with extreme hours remained very low, most other countries in Western Europe exhibit significantly higher ratios of extreme workers after the beginning of the 1990 s than in the previous two decades. Second, the article detects the development of two diverging trajectories in the advanced capitalist world: one with a strong and stable labor regulation along with a balanced working hour profile and one with gradual deregulation along with an increasing ratio of long work weeks. Finally, using a series of pooled cross-section OLS estimations, the article tests five specific hypotheses, motivated by theories of the welfare state and political economy theories of globalization. The results provide strong empirical evidence for the notion that patterns of extreme working hours are not inherent in post-industrial development. The article uses data from the author's extreme working hours standardized meta-database which had been compiled from two large micro data collections: the Luxembourg Income Study database (LIS) and the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) ...|$|R
40|$|In liberalized {{electricity}} markets, {{the outputs}} of controllable units (both generatorsand demands) must be defined at regular time intervals ("dispatch intervals"). Nowadays,balancing services are procured and dispatched {{not in the}} most efficient waypartly due to long dispatch intervals. The dispatch interval in most <b>European</b> countriesis one <b>hour.</b> The shortest dispatch interval is five minutes and is used in theAustralian National Electricity Market (NEM). During the dispatch interval, demandand wind power capacity uctuates a lot. To keep the supply-demand balance in thesystem, some generators participate in frequency control. This action increases thesystem operation cost. By reducing the dispatch interval to {{short periods of time}} over which physical limitsof the power system are fully respected, balance services could be dispatched in amore efficient way. This improves the overall economic efficiency of the system. This work derives the mathematical model for short-run economic dispatch. For thismodeling, three stages are considered: (1) initial steady state in which the systemmight be exposed to a change, (2) the transition period which models the transitioncost after the change happened and before the system goes to another steady stateequilibrium, and finally (3) the final steady state equilibrium which models the systemcost when the change in the system has been handled by the exible generating units. These three stages are modeled in a single optimization problem. The developedoptimization problem is a linear programming problem. The developed formulationfor the short-run economic dispatch is modeled in GAMS platform. Two applicationsof the proposed model are discussed: (1) power system security, and (2) real-timebalancing market. In the first application, analysis of the optimal dispatch of nodaloperating reserves to provide sufficient exibility to survive a set of credible contingenciesis performed. In the second application, an algorithm for the dispatch ofbalancing services in the real-time balancing market is proposed. These two applicationsof the proposed short-run economic dispatch are tested on a simple six-busexample system and IEEE twenty-four-bus example system. The optimal dispatch isfound and conclusions are drawn. The numerical results of the proposed model showpromising results...|$|R
