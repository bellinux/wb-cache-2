5|$|The Queen, {{pregnant}} again, {{was aware}} of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality. At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it. Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} {{loved his}} young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion of}} their first New Year in 1386, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil {{to live with his}} step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where {{in the early years of}} their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E

In Bavaria the couple settled in Schloss Nymphenburg outside Münich.

In Munich, Paz met King Ludwig II of Bavaria, they conversed in French and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> warm welcome.

25|$|Langtry and Baird {{met at a}} race {{course when}} <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> betting tip and the stake money to place on the horse. The horse won and, at a later luncheon party, Baird also offered her the gift of a horse named Milford. She at first demurred, but others at the table advised her to accept, as this horse was a very fine prospect. The horse won several races under Langtry’s colours; he was {{registered}} to “Mr Jersey” (women were excluded from registering horses at this time). Langtry became involved {{in a relationship with}} Baird, from 1891 until his death in March 1893.|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E
25|$|When Eckenfelder {{returned}} to Balingen, he met Elsa Martz. 18 years his junior, {{she was an}} alto singer and piano teacher from a prosperous middle-class family. When she was young, she had enjoyed going to the opera; however, her family regarded this as beneath their station. Despite or because of receiving many marriage proposals, she had remained single. She and Eckenfelder developed a platonic love. They wrote each other love letters using the formal mode of address, Sie, visited each other, went on walks together and exchanged gifts. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> self-portrait and a landscape, , and she referred to the picture as Bächlein meiner Liebe (Little brook of my love).

25|$|In June 1699 Kidd {{was stopped}} on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the {{permission}} of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, he buried $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it's on private property.|$|E
500|$|Fields relayed Nico's {{request to}} Jac Holzman, head of Elektra Records; she {{then went to}} Holzman's Broadway office with her {{harmonium}} and performed for him. Despite the challenging nature of Nico's music, Holzman agreed to release her album and assigned Frazier Mohawk to produce it, despite Nico and John Cale's desire to work together. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> budget of $10,000 (...) , with a four-day recording schedule at a studio on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. Fields contacted Cale, who was the album's de facto producer after Mohawk gave him free rein. According to Mohawk, {{he spent most of}} the sessions using heroin with Nico. Her drug use is cited as influencing the album's sound; Simon Reynolds wrote, [...] "While it may be a reductive interpretation to regard The Marble Index as the ultimate heroin album, its hunger for narcosis, its frigid expanses, recalls William Burroughs's description of the junkie's quest for a metabolic 'Absolute Zero'." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "world press" [...] {{arrived at}} the ashram gate and the Maharishi asked {{them to come back}} after the Beatles had had [...] "a little time with the course". According to author and course participant, Cooke de Herrera, the Beatles were [...] "very happy at the way it was done". De Herrara wrote in her memoir that the Maharishi gave [...] "special attention" [...] to all the celebrities despite her {{warnings}} not to feed their egos. Mia Farrow wrote that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi's attention to her, including private sessions, gifts of mangoes, and a birthday party where <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> paper crown. Early the following morning the Maharishi arranged for a group photo and told everyone where to sit. [...] Since it was her birthday the day before, Mia was asked to sit in the centre and each student was adorned with a marigold garland. [...] All sat on a podium and the Maharishi had a large picture of his guru, Brahmananda Saraswati, behind him. The photo took half an hour and has been described as [...] "one of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock 'n' roll". Photographers included Paul Saltzman, a Canadian filmmaker who was visiting the ashram after completing film work elsewhere in India. Saltzman's snapshots from this time were later assembled into a book, The Beatles in India (2000).|$|E

500|$|George {{had been}} raised under strict conditions, which he had rebelled against. [...] Despite this, he {{attempted}} to put his daughter, who had {{the appearance of a}} grown woman at age 15, under even stricter conditions. [...] <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> clothing allowance insufficient for an adult princess, and insisted that if she attended the opera, she was to sit {{in the rear of the}} box and leave before the end. [...] With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts. [...] Bored, she soon became infatuated with her first cousin, George FitzClarence, illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence. [...] FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte's gaze fell on Lieutenant Charles Hesse of the Light Dragoons, reputedly the illegitimate son of Charlotte's uncle, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. [...] Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings. [...] Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent's rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter's passion. She did everything that she could to encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments. [...] These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain. Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.|$|E
500|$|Miloš Forman's {{first feature}} film Cerný Petr (Black Peter) was {{released}} in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year's Locarno Film Festival, where it won the top prize, thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia's communist bureaucracy and {{making it possible for}} Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom. Unsure of what the next project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase. [...] <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> lift and learned her story: [...] she had come to the big city from Varnsdorf, where she had been seduced by a young engineer, who had given her a phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life. [...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for {{much of the rest of}} the night, before putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase. In Forman's words: [...] "I guess I'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city." ...|$|E

In December, a psychiatric evaluation arranged by her probation officer recommended Spencer be admitted to a mental hospital for depression, but her father refused to give permission.

She told him it would be inappropriate for them to end up in a relationship if they were working together. Neil finally convinced her that if they had an overwhelming urge to date, he would fire her. Leslie accepted the job." [...] In December 2012, Redaric Williams was introduced to the series as her brother Tyler Michaelson, Leslie's first family member to appear on the soap opera. Williams told Soap Opera Digest that although Tyler is [...] "impatient", he gets along with his sister [...] "really well" [...] and they are [...] "very comfortable with each other".|$|E
