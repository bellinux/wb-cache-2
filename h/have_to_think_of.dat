25|$|Gramsci {{stated that}} bourgeois {{cultural}} values {{were tied to}} folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between {{the religion of the}} learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as an expression of their own experience.|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO. The group had also planned to tour in Israel and Australia following their European tour, but refused to do so, as they had been away from home for three weeks and found the tour [...] "rigorous". Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music. When we discovered that, we realized that the music we were working with really was universal, that we didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a particular market. People everywhere like to dance, sweat and party, and they like the same kind of sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work hard at it to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

60|$|Again I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the Italian soul, {{how it is}} dark, {{cleaving}} to {{the eternal}} night. It seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become so, at the Renaissance, after the Renaissance.|$|R

500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: [...] "It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us {{and a lot of other}} people." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{composer}} had accepted a commission from the Teatro Argentina in Rome and had considered {{the subject of}} Lorenzino de' Medici on which Piave had already begun work. Verdi encouraged the librettist to continue his work and then submit the work to the Roman authorities but, as a backup, he wrote: [...] "But, {{just in case the}} police don't allow it, we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a quick alternative and I suggest The Two Foscari. I like the plot and the outline is already there in Venice." [...] It appears that Verdi had already submitted it to La Fenice at some earlier time, and so he encourages Piave to work on it, [...] "but stick closely to Byron" [...] he notes.|$|E

There was no shade of coming back on little Paul; no preparation for it, or other reference to it, grew out of anything he thought or did, except this slight one in connexion with his sister.
