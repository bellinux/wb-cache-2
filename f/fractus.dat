25|$|The species <b>fractus</b> shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus <b>fractus)</b> or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus <b>fractus).</b> When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. <b>Fractus</b> clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|E
500|$|The species Cumulus <b>fractus</b> is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature pannus (also called scud) which can also include stratus <b>fractus</b> of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus". The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise {{any of the four}} species of cumulus.|$|E

Lower numbers of RBCs were recorded in fish samples exposed to the crude oil <b>fracti</b> ons than in the control fish. The comparatively high RBCs in fish during the 4 days toxicity period than during 42 days recovery periods is attributed to the greater destruction o f RBCs during the toxicity period. The 4. 00 ml L- 1 LBO and BLCO concentration were apparently preferred by the fish to maintain a higher number of RBCs than with 1. 00, 2. 00, and 8. 00 ml L- 1 concentrations. Similarly, the 8. 00 ml L- 1 concentrations of DPK and PMS gave better values of RBCs than the 1 00, 2. 00 and 4 00 ml L- 1 concentrations.

This is a finite parameter model which exhibits both long-range dependence (long memory) and high variability.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the varied possibilities for following a two-level fractional factorial with another fractional factorial {{half the size}} of the original experiment. While follow-up fractions of the same size as an original experiment are common practice, in many situations a smaller follow-up experiment will suffice. Peter John coined the term "semifolding" to describe using half of a foldover design. Existing literature does include brief mention and examples of semifolding but no thorough development of this followup strategy. After a quick examination of the estimation details for semifolding the 1 - 4 IV 2 design, we focus on following 16 -run fractions with a semifold design of eight runs. Two such examples are considered - one where the initial fraction is resolution IV, the other resolution III. A general result is proven for semifolding p k - IV 2 designs. Conducting full foldover designs in two blocks is also recommended. Key words: blocking, foldover, irregular <b>fracti</b> [...] ...|$|R

6000|$|To {{expect a}} man to be the same at sixty as he was at thirty, is to suppose that the sun at noon shall be graced with the colors which adorn its setting. And there are men whose intellects are set on so fine a pivot that a {{variation}} in the breeze of the moment, which coarser minds shall not feel, will carry them round with a rapidity which baffles the common eye. The man who saw his duty clearly on this side in the morning shall, before the evening come, recognize it on the other; and then again, and again, and yet again the vane shall go round. It may be that an instrument shall be too fine for our daily uses. We do not want a clock to strike the minutes, or a glass to tell the momentary changes in the atmosphere. It may be found that for the work of the world, the coarse work--and no work is so coarse, though none is so important, as that which falls commonly into the hands of statesmen--instruments strong in texture, and by reason of their rudeness not liable to sudden impressions, may be the best. That it is which we mean when we declare that a scrupulous man is impractical in politics. But the same man may, at various periods of his life, and on various days at the same period, be scrupulous and unscrupulous, impractical and practical, as the circumstances of the occasion may affect him. At one moment the rule of simple honesty will prevail with him. [...] "Fiat justitia, ruat c[oe]lum." [...] "Si <b>fractus</b> illabatur orbis Impavidum ferient ruinæ." [...] At another he will see the necessity of a compromise {{for the good of the}} many. He will tell himself that if the best cannot be done, he must content himself with the next best. He must shake hands with the imperfect, as the best way of lifting himself up from a bad way toward a better. In obedience to his very conscience he will temporize, and, finding no other way of achieving good, will do even evil that good may come of it. [...] "Rem si possis recte; si non, quocunque modo rem." [...] In judging of such a character as this, a hard and fast line will certainly lead us astray. In judging of Cicero, such a hard and fast line has too generally been used. He was a man singularly sensitive to all influences. It must be admitted that he was a vane, turning on a pivot finer than those on which statesmen have generally been made to work. He had none of the fixed purpose of Cæsar, or the unflinching principle of Cato. They were men cased in brass, whose feelings nothing could hurt. They suffered from none of those inward flutterings of the heart, doubtful aspirations, human longings, sharp sympathies, dreams of something better than this world, fears of something worse, which make Cicero so like a well-bred, polished gentleman of the present day. It is because he has so little like a Roman that he is of all the Romans the most attractive.|$|E
