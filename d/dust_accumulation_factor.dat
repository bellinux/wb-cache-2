The dust concentration in the air was measured continuously during the test period, and the rate of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> on the concentrator's surface was determined. For the purpose of comparison, an identical concentrator, the surface of which was kept clean, was evaluated simultaneously with the dusty concentrator. The change of the I/V characteristics as a result of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> was related to the amount of dust accumulated per unit area of the collector surface (g/m** 2). It has been shown that the major reductions in the short-circuit current, cell temperature and the efficiency occur as the dust starts to deposit onto the collector surface, but the rate of decrease is slower for <b>dust</b> <b>accumulations</b> beyond 2 g/m** 2.

40|$|Sensitivity-corrected quartz {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating {{methods have}} been widely accepted as a promising tool {{for the construction of}} late Pleistocene chronology and mass or <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates (MARs or DARs) on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Many quartz OSL ages covering marine isotope stage (MIS) 2 (equal to L 1 - 1 in Chinese loess) have been determined for individual sites within the CLP in the past decade. However, there is still a lack of detailed MAR or DAR reconstruction during MIS 2 across the whole of the CLP. Here, we present detailed MARs determined for eight sites with closely-spaced quartz OSL ages covering ?MIS 2, and relative MARs suggested by a probability density analysis of 159 quartz OSL ages ranging from ? 30 to 10 ka ago, from 15 sites on the CLP. The results show enhanced <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), with particularly rapid <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> from ? 23 to 19 ka ago (the late LGM). In contrast, MARs determined for the last deglaciation (from ? 19 to 12 ka ago) are low. The MAR changes during MIS 2 in Chinese loess are mainly controlled by the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) intensity, which is forced by Northern Hemisphere ice volume. The MAR changes also indicate that <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> during MIS 2 is generally continuous at millennial time scales on the CLP. Comparison of Asian-sourced aeolian dust MARs in Chinese loess with those preserved in Greenland ice cores and North Pacific Ocean sediments indicates that rapid <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> occurred from ? 26 to 23 ka ago (the early LGM) in Greenland ice cores and North Pacific Ocean sediments, suggesting a several kilo-year difference in timing when compared with the rapid <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> during the late LGM in Chinese loess. This asynchronous timing in enhanced <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> is probably related to both changes in the EAWM intensity and changes in the mean position of zone axis of the Westerly jet, both of which are greatly influenced by Northern Hemisphere ice volume. This study highlights the possible influence of changes in the mean position of zone axis of the Westerly jet on long-range transport of Asian-sourced dust. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> on {{surfaces}} of critical instruments {{has been a}} major concern during lunar and Mars missions. Operation of instruments such as solar panels, chromatic calibration targets, as well as Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits has been severely compromised in the past as a result of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> and adhesion. Wind storms with wind speeds of up to 70 mph have not been effective in removing significant amounts of the deposited dust. This is indeed an indication of the strength of the adhesion force(s) involved between the dust particles and the surface(s) that they have adhered to. Complications associated with <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> are more severe for non-conducting surfaces and have been the focus of this work. Methodology: Argon plasma treatment was investigated as a mechanism for lowering <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> on non-conducting polymeric surfaces.

40|$|Lunar base activity, {{particularly}} {{rocket launch}} and landing, will suspend and transport lunar dust. From preliminary models, the resulting <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> can be significant, even {{as far as}} 2 km from the source. For example, at 2 km approximately 0. 28 mg/sq cm of dust is anticipated to accumulate after only 10 surface missions with a 26, 800 N excursion vehicle.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> in, and removal from, {{recently}} installed supply air ducts {{and on the}} bristle behaviour of rotating duct cleaning brushes. The results of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation,</b> measured using three different methods, were compared {{and the amount of}} dust in newly installed air ducts was evaluated. The vacuum test was found to be an efficient method of collecting dust samples on the duct surface. The vacuum test and the gravimetric tape method gave approximately the same results when the measured <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> on the duct surfaces was 0. 1 - 1. 0  g/m 2. The gravimetric and optical tape methods can be used to evaluate cleanliness of new ducts when the amount of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> is 0. 1 - 1. 0  g/m 2. The effect of protection measures on <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> was studied. The mean amount of accumulated dust after construction was 0. 9  g/m 2 in cleanliness category P 1 ducts, which have special requirements for oil residues and protection measures against contamination during construction, and 2. 3  g/m 2 in cleanliness category P 2 ducts, which have only minor protection requirements and are for normal use. The results show that <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> in category P 1 ducts was significantly lower (P <  0. 008) than in category P 2 ducts. The highest mean amount of <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> was found {{in the middle of the}} ducts and the lowest amount near the air handling units. The efficiency of two dry air duct cleaning methods applied to new air ducts was compared. Mechanical brushing and compressed air cleaning methods were found to be efficient in removing dust from the newly installed air duct surfaces. Mechanical brushing was more efficient in metal ducts, while the compressed air cleaning method was more efficient in plastic ducts. The mean amount of residual dust on the duct surfaces was below 0. 4  g/m 2 after duct cleaning. However, neither of the cleaning methods studied was efficient enough to clean ducts that had a high level of residual oil (216 - 338  mg/m 2) on the duct surfaces. A mathematical model to simulate the behaviour of a single bristle of a rotating duct cleaning brush was developed. The results of the simulation were compared with those obtained from a laboratory test. The simulated and experimental results were found to be in reasonable agreement. The dependence of the normal force and the contact angle as a function of various parameters was studied. The simulation and experimental results showed that the normal force and contact angle increase as a function of the rotation speed. Further, the thickness of the bristle was found to have a strong effect on the normal force. Air drag has only a slight effect on the deflection of the bristle. The model can be used as a first step in the systematic design of brushes. However, further theoretical and experimental research is needed to determine the dependency, for instance, between the brush tip normal force and its cleaning efficiency. reviewe...|$|R

Five vegetation coverage treatments (15 %, 35 %, 55 %, 75 % and 95 %) were constructed, with 0 % coverage as a control. Vegetation coverage significantly affected <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> in degenerated semiarid grasslands. The amounts of dust trapped by the increasing coverages were 1. 7, 1. 8, 2. 0, 2. 1 and 2. 1 times of that by the control plot, respectively. The total accumulations reached a maximum of 2. 5 g m(- 2) day(- 1) at 75 % coverage and remained stable with further increasing vegetation coverage. The particles in the dust trapped by treatment without vegetation coverage were significantly coarser than those by treatments with vegetation. In addition, the dust trapped by treatments with vegetation contained more organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content than that by the control plot.

40|$|Marine {{sediment}} records {{reveal an}} abrupt and strong increase in dust deposition in the North Atlantic {{at the end}} of the African Humid Period about 4. 9 to 5. 5  ka ago. The change in dust flux has been attributed to varying Saharan land surface cover. Alternatively, the enhanced <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> is linked to enhanced surface winds and a consequent intensification of coastal upwelling. Here we demonstrate for the first time the direct link between <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> in marine cores and changes in Saharan land surface. We simulate the mid-Holocene (6  ka BP) and pre-industrial (1850  AD) dust cycle as a function of Saharan land surface cover and atmosphere-ocean conditions using the coupled atmosphere–aerosol model ECHAM 6. 1 -HAM 2. 1. Mid-Holocene surface characteristics, including vegetation cover and lake surface area, are derived from proxy data and simulations. In agreement with data from marine sediment cores, our simulations show that mid-Holocene dust deposition fluxes in the North Atlantic were two to three times lower compared with pre-industrial fluxes. We identify Saharan land surface characteristics to be the main control on dust transport from North Africa to the North Atlantic. We conclude that the increase in <b>dust</b> <b>accumulation</b> in marine cores is directly linked to a transition of the Saharan landscape during the Holocene and not due to changes in atmospheric or ocean conditions alone...|$|R
