Cartilage growth is partly genetically determined but is strongly influenced by epigenetic factors.

There exist a lot of studies describing <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> production or occurrence directly in the thyroid tissue.

The finding of suitable peripheral marker could be used in thyroid tumors diagnosis in the future.

The aim was a more detailed understanding of particular <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> role in a process of thyroid oncogenesis. <b>Growth</b> <b>factors</b> are polypeptides, proteins and glycoproteins with an informative and regulatory function. They have mainly local effects in tissues - autocrine and paracrine. They form an extensive cytokine network in the organism, with complicated synergic and antagonistic linkages.

50|$|Heparanase cleaves heparin sulfate {{chains of}} HSPGs, which have an {{extensive}} network with several proteins {{on the cell}} surface and ECM. The basic HSPG structure consists of a protein core to which several linear heparin sulfate (HS) chains are covalently O-linked; this acts as an assembly of different ECM proteins, including fibronectin, laminins, interstitial collagens, heparin-binding <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> chemokines and lipoproteins. HSPGs are prominent components of blood vessels. Binding to HS stabilizes fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> (FGFs) and vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> (VEGFs) and prevents them from inactivation. HS chains function as low-affinity co-receptors which promote dimerization of FGFs, aids in the sequestration of the <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> (GFs) and causes activation of the signaling tyrosine kinase receptors even under low circulating concentrations of <b>growth</b> <b>factors.</b> Heparanase expressed by cancer cells participates in angiogenesis and neovascularization by degrading the polysaccharide scaffold of the endothelial BM, thereby releasing angiogenic <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> from the ECM.|$|R

Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of PI3K signaling. In many cancers the PTEN expression is decreased and may be downregulated through several mechanisms, including mutations, loss of heterozygosity, methylation, and protein instability.|$|E

The most intensively investigated bone <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the transforming growth factor-bβ (TGF-βs).

Possible clinical applications for bone <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> include impaired bone healing, inadequate bone stock, and incomplete incorporation of prosthetic implants into bone. In therapeutic use the bone <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> need a carrier.

Several biodegradable materials have been investigated as carriers for bone <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> including organic materials, ceramics, and synthetic polymers such as polylactide and polylactide-polyglycolide co-polymer. Bioabsorbable polymers possess several attractive features as delivery systems.
