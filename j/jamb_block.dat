The extant walls are buried under as much as 2. 0 m of loose stone, brick, and rubble, perhaps from the collapsed vault or semidome of the building. Along the apse, the inner face of the wall is visible to a height 1. 1 m above the present ground surface, as is a single bench synthronon (H: 0. 30 m), both exposed by illicit excavations. Numerous fragments of roof tiles and marble paving stones are {{mixed in with the}} debris. The side walls are built of unmortared schist with some brick inclusions. The rubble masonry of the apse and synthronon (W: 0. 70 m), however, is heavily mortared, and the joints between the stones are scored (Fig. 21). The full 0. 8 m thickness of the side walls can be measured only at {{what appears to be the}} dividing wall between the nave and the narthex; the maximum preserved height is 0. 8 m, and the wall is exposed for 1. 1 m. Robber's pits along the north wall have exposed some other construction details, including the inner wall of the apse and the foundations of the synthronon. From the southeast end of the apse, the outer wall runs to the southeast at a right angle to the apse wall for at least 1. 4 m, probably connecting the naos to a side chamber. A platform about 8 m wide extends the length of the southern (downhill) side of the chapel and perhaps indicates the presence of an ancillary structure there. ** Fragments of the church's marble decoration that have survived in the area include a doorjamb found in front of an abandoned house not far from the church in 2005 but not seen again in subsequent visits. Nearby was a fragment of a marble screen panel showing the lower arm of a lobed cross together with an unidentified motif, perhaps a stylized cypress tree (A 071) (H: 0. 47 m; W: 0. 30 m; D: 0. 08 m). Both the doorjamb and the screen panel could be from this church. The decoration of the <b>jamb</b> <b>block</b> is typically Middle Byzantine; one side is profiled, and the front is carved with interlocked chains of guilloches and lozenges. This design is comparable to the decoration of architectural features that were part of the renovation of the Cathedral in Aphrodisias, dated to the tenth century...|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} is polychrome and {{was constructed}} from brick, terracotta and faience. The ground floor has a full-width tiled fascia continuing {{along to the}} neighbouring building; this 20th-century alteration may conceal earlier detail. The arcaded first floor has sash windows with sloping sills in the Gothic faience arcade, clasping rings and crocket capitals to the nookshafts, alternate <b>block</b> <b>jambs,</b> raised pointed arches and roll-moulded dripstring. The ogee window heads have fleur-de-lys finials in front of lozenge-patterned terracotta spandrels. The eaves cornice has a corbelled trefoil frieze.|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Aphrodisias, South NecropolisLocal Informant: MustafaLocal Information: Erbey Deresi Mevkii, Geyre 5 : 13 : 07 PM Dug in 1990 by museum but {{filled in}} by farmers by 1991 ** Mustafa said all brick, tile and pipe found on mound is {{from around the}} structureLatitude: 37. 41. 57. 855 Longitude: 28. 42. 51. 087 Elevation: 541. 709 mAxis: eastDimensions: Platform: L: 11. 55 m, W: 8. 45 mDescription: Well {{preserved}} underground chambers and superstructure; antechamber accessible and cleared to near floor level, main chamber filled; located on a level rise; about 150 m to the north, ground drops away toward a seasonal streambed. The remains of the superstructure are the most extensive of any tomb at Aphrodisias. The outer walls (e-w 11. 55 m; n-s 8. 45 m) are preserved in up to four courses of large petit apareil masonry, with the largest stones in the lower courses (H: 0. 26 - 0. 32 m, W: 0. 56 - 0. 06 m, D: 0. 38 - 0. 45 m). The eastern end preserves elements of a tetrastyle façade including: euthenteria blocks (H: 0. 30 m, L: 0. 43 - 0. 70 m, D: 0. 51 m) and stylobate blocks (H: 0. 24 m), atop which are the two central pedestals (top 0. 60 m square; shaft: 0. 55 m square) with a further step (H: 0. 24 m, D: 0. 30 m) between them. Architectural blocks atop {{the eastern end of}} the tomb include a smoothly finished Attic Ionic column base (diam. : 0. 525 m) that would fit atop the pedestals, and an architrave (L: 2. 40 m) the same length as the intercolumniation between the two pedestals. In the field boundaries nearby to the southeast are further blocks that could pertain to the structure including a monumental crowning molded block, a second architrave, a doorjamb, a fluted double capital, wall blocks with dowel holes and swallow-tail clamp cuttings, and fragments of monolithic columns. The one accessible vaulted underground chamber (n-s 6. 95 m, e-w 1. 89 m) is well preserved to the south and partially collapsed to the north, and cleared to within 2. 60 m of the vault. It is the antechamber to the primary burial chamber, and was accessed by a doorway (W: 0. 76 m) through {{the south end of the}} west wall. The main tomb chamber was reached through a central doorway (W: 0. 76 m) also in the west wall (Th: 0. 80 m); both openings have flat lintels. The regularly coursed petit appareil blocks are heavily mortared, and the mortar beds are occasionally scored. The lower half of the vault appears to be built from corbelled petit appareil blocks, while the upper half is a mass of heavily mortared rubble and radially placed flat stones. Three evenly spaced windows pierce the east wall of the antechamber. The openings (H: 0. 45 - 0. 54, W: 0. 38 - 0. 43 m, D: 1. 13 m) extend from the intrados of the vault up through a slit in the center of the rising face of the stair blocks in the east façade. Also on the eastern wall are four small niches in the spaces between and below the widows; they are similar to put log holes, except that there are no corresponding holes in the western wall. They could have been shelves for small oil lamps. ** The immediate field boundaries are approximately aligned with the tomb; some pottery and tile fragments are seen in the field to the north.
