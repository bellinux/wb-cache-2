50|$|Flexible duct is very {{convenient}} for attaching supply air outlets to the rigid ductwork. It is commonly attached with long zip ties or metal band claps. However, the pressure loss {{is higher than}} for most other types of ducts. As such, designers and installers attempt to keep their <b>installed</b> <b>lengths</b> (runs) short, e.g. less than 15 feet or so, and try to minimize turns. Kinks in flexible ducting must be avoided. Some flexible duct markets prefer to avoid using flexible duct on the return air portions of HVAC systems, however flexible duct can tolerate moderate s. The UL181 test requires a negative pressure of 200 Pa.|$|R

5000|$|Start of {{construction}} for the highline179 was in April 2014, {{and at the}} beginning of May the groundbreaking started. To protect the trunk road to be crossed, a protective scaffold with switchboards was <b>installed</b> over a <b>length</b> of 20 meters.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 {{the bridge}} was used to carry {{electric}} cables to supply power to Rockhampton, {{as an alternative to}} towers. In 1951 steel handrails were <b>installed</b> along the <b>length</b> of the bridge. Repairs to the bridge were carried out in 1958 and 1960.|$|R
50|$|Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) was {{developed}} {{in response to the}} observation that the bulk of track maintenance work takes place at the joints. As steel production and manufacturing processes improved, the rail <b>lengths</b> <b>installed</b> were progressively increased, and the logical extension of this would be to eliminate the joints altogether.|$|R
50|$|The soils {{throughout}} the river basin are eroded {{and the regional}} ecology is degraded {{as a result of}} cattle grazing from the numerous pastoral stations found through the area. As a result, fencing has been <b>installed</b> through the <b>length</b> of the river, water tanks and troughs installed and establishment of new grazing yards.|$|R
50|$|The {{solar panels}} Musk plans to <b>install</b> along the <b>length</b> of the Hyperloop system {{have been criticized}} by Prof. Roger Goodall, as not being {{feasible}} enough to return enough energy to power the Hyperloop system, arguing that the air pumps and propulsion would require much more power than the solar panels could generate.|$|R
50|$|Diamond was {{an early}} (1997) entrant into PC DVD kits with their Maximum DVD 1000DB-VAR (Value Added Reseller) and 2000-RETKIT (RETail KIT). These kits bundled a 'feature reduced' (several pin headers and other parts not <b>installed)</b> full <b>length</b> PCI MPEG2 analog overlay decoder card made by divion. This card {{connected}} to the VGA card with an external passthrough cable, a 3.5mm (1/8") external patch cord to the soundcard's line-in jack, and the analog audio cable from the included Toshiba SD-M1002 DVD-ROM drive connected to the divion card while a second cable passed the audio on to the soundcard's internal connector.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seven}} years {{preceding}} and including 2009, six people died in {{a section of the}} freeway known as the Bulleen Bend. This is the tightest bend in the freeway's length, between the Bulleen and Doncaster Road interchanges. Despite the relatively tight bend and 100 km/h limit, there were few safety barriers on the extremities of the road surface, leaving nothing between the cars and the trees on the road shoulder. Flexible barriers were <b>installed</b> along <b>lengths</b> of the freeway in an attempt to improve safety. These measures reduced the relative risk of casualty crashes by approximately 75 percent.|$|R
5000|$|One major rule change {{regarding}} time trials {{was implemented}} for 1982. All cars {{would be allowed}} only two warm up laps for qualifying, down from three, which had been the rule since 1946. After two major pit fires in 1981 (Rick Mears at the 1981 Indy 500 and Herm Johnson at the Michigan 500), new rules were implemented for refuling safety. Pit side fuel tanks were required to be anchored to the ground, while new high-pressure fire hoses were <b>installed</b> the <b>length</b> of the pit lane. Significant improvement were also made the fuel nozzles, hoses, and [...] "buckeyes" [...] on the cars themselves.|$|R
50|$|An elbow is <b>installed</b> {{between two}} <b>lengths</b> of pipe (or tubing) {{to allow a}} change of direction, usually a 90° or 45° angle; 22.5° elbows are also available. The ends may be {{machined}} for butt welding, threaded (usually female), or socketed. When the ends differ in size, it {{is known as a}} reducing (or reducer) elbow.|$|R
50|$|Memory Trace (2012), {{commissioned}} by the Wellcome Trust, and <b>installed</b> the <b>length</b> of the windows {{at the front of}} their headquarters on Euston Road, London, is a photographic landscape of London sculpted from drawings of the brain from different times in history, and featuring landmarks used by taxi drivers as navigational points, the work links the capital's urban topography with pathways created in our memory, whilst referring to how the hippocampus grows in the brains of London taxi drivers in order to accommodate in-depth experiential and relational spatial knowledge. At night the landscape fades into silhouette and LED lights bring the spatial journeys and neural pathways to the fore.|$|R
50|$|In addition, extra {{stabling}} {{facilities were}} provided by utilitising unused sections of tunnels beyond the station. These tunnels were constructed on anticipation of continued tunnelling towards Kingsford. They have had track laid and overhead wire <b>installed</b> for a <b>length</b> of two eight-car trains in each tunnel. This gives a total stabling capacity of five eight-car trains (two in each siding {{and one in the}} turnback tunnel).|$|R
50|$|The {{mahogany}} {{furniture was}} ordered from Maple's of London. Damascus-made 'East Orient style' lamps, lanterns, and chandeliers hung throughout, suspended like stalactite pendants. The upper gallery contained oak-paneled reading and card rooms furnished by Krieger of Paris. The basement and staff areas were {{so large that}} a narrow gauge railway was <b>installed</b> running the <b>length</b> of the hotel, passing by offices, kitchens, pantries, refrigerators, storerooms and the staff mess.|$|R
40|$|Various {{approaches}} and methods {{are used for}} designing of optimum deployment of Passive Optical Networks (PON) according to selected optimization criteria, such as optimal trenching distance, endpoint attenuation and overall <b>installed</b> fibre <b>length.</b> This article describes the ideas and possibilities for an algorithm with the application of graph algorithms for finding the shortest path from Optical Line Termination to Optical Network Terminal unit. This algorithm uses a combination of different methods for generating of an optimal metric, thus creating the optimized tree topology mainly focused on summary trenching distance. Furthermore, it deals with algorithms for finding an optimal placement of optical splitter {{with the help of}} K-Means clustering method and hierarchical clustering technique. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with existing methods...|$|R

Originally scheduled to be introduced {{in the summer of}} 2013, the low-cost system developed by Takamisawa Cybernetics consists of three bars that are raised and lowered in front of the train doors, and will be <b>installed</b> for a <b>length</b> of one carriage on the down platform for a period of one year.|$|R
5000|$|By 1938, Singapore needed {{additional}} {{water supply}} {{for the growing}} population and Murnane {{was responsible for the}} long term planning: 'many a water-works engineer spends his time carrying out the plans of his predecessor and thinking out the work to be done by his successor'. [...] Murnane proposed a major $5.5 million investment which involved a new 39" [...] duplicate pipeline from Gunong Pulai to Singapore, a doubling of water treatment capacity in the Johor reservoirs, and the building of a large new permanent reservoir in Seletar in Singapore. By this date water consumption in Singapore was 21 million gallons per day. The Straits Times on 2 April 1939 has photos of construction work including one of Murnane supervising the works which involved 1,400 workers <b>installing</b> -ton <b>lengths</b> of pipe.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock on}} the Cx4 has an {{adjustable}} length of pull. Adjustment {{is made by}} the use of stock spacers. The carbine comes with one spacer installed, which may be removed. With no stock spacers <b>installed</b> the minimum <b>length</b> of pull of the Cx4 is 337 mm. To increase the length of pull, additional stock spacers may be purchased separately. A total of three stock spacers may be installed which bring the length of pull to a maximum of 382 mm.|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforcement}} {{quality of}} the fully resin encapsulated bolt depends on several factors, which are {{a combination of the}} bolt design configuration, bolt/hole diameter ratio and installation procedure. Gloving in bolt installation constitutes a challenging problem for effective strata reinforcement and the stability of gate roads and tunnels. A total of ten bolts were installed into ten 1. 7 m long threaded steel pipes with different resin spin times, the pipes were retrieved from the installed holes in an underground mine road way roof and then cut into 100 mm long sections. The encapsulated bolts in the tube sections were then push tested. Significant variations were found in bond strength along the <b>installed</b> bolt <b>length</b> in the whole tube, with typically the top 200 mm of bolt being significantly lower (50 %) in most cases due to gloving and unmixed resin components...|$|R
40|$|Roof bolt {{system design}} means the {{selection}} of the type, length, capacity, and pattern of bolts for a particular application. Despite research efforts dating back 50 years, no design methodology has found wide acceptance. This paper begins by identifying four mechanisms that roof bolts use to reinforce the ground. It argues that the reinforcement mechanism is determined by the roof geology and stress level, not by the type of bolt. Next, the attributes of roof bolts are discussed in the light of recent research, including anchorage mechanism, <b>installed</b> tension, <b>length,</b> capacity, timing of installation, and installation quality. Several significant areas of controversy are identified. Design methods from around the world are discussed, including those based on empirical research, numerical modeling, and roof monitoring. Finally, some simple guidelines for preliminary design of roof bolt systems are proposed based on statistical analysis of roof support performance at 37 U. S. mines...|$|R
50|$|In January 2009 a Melbourne girl, Darcey Freeman, aged 4, {{was thrown}} {{off of the}} bridge by her father and later died in hospital. In April 2011, Arthur Freeman {{was found guilty of}} murder and sentenced to life in prison. Following the incident, a {{temporary}} suicide barrier of concrete crash barriers topped with a welded mesh fence was erected starting in February. By June, it had been claimed that the fence had prevented two suicides. A permanent barrier was later <b>installed</b> along the <b>length</b> of the bridge. The barriers are costed at $20 million.|$|R

40|$|A {{pulse-echo}} acoustic {{method was}} investigated for evalu-ating wood stake decomposition in the field. A total of 58 wood stakes (29 loblolly pine, Pinus taeda, and 29 aspen, Populus tremuloides) that were vertically <b>installed</b> (full <b>length)</b> in forest soils were non-destructively tested {{by means of}} a laboratory-type acoustic measurement system. The same acoustic measurements were also conducted on the wood stakes after they were removed from the soil. Compression (parallel to grain) tests were then performed on the stakes in the laboratory to obtain residual elastic and strength properties. The results indi-cate that the pulse-echo acoustic method is a good approach to characterize wood stakes that are fully inserted into mineral soils. Statistical analysis showed good relationships between acoustic parameters (num-ber of pulse echoes and in-ground acoustic velocity) and percentage weight loss, modulus of elasticity in com-pression, and residual compressive strength. The pulse-echo acoustic method {{could be used as a}} monitoring tool to assess progressive levels of wood stake decom-position in forest soil...|$|R
50|$|The deck, which curves {{from one}} end to the other, was {{reinforced}} by adding heavily confined edge beams encasing high strength steel along the inside face of the exterior longitudinal girders underneath. These rods extended {{from one end}} of the roadway to the other. The reinforced edge beams ensure continuity across the many expansion joints and help distribute the bending strains due to lateral flexure. In addition to the reinforced edge beam, four large prestressing tendons were <b>installed</b> the <b>length</b> of the bridge along the underside of the deck slab. These tendons are stressed to pre-compress the concrete deck to approximately 800 psi and also serve as flexural reinforcement along with the high strength rods. Finally, engineers found a way to reinforce the bent columns attached to the arch, which possess complex and varying geometric challenges. They encased the bent columns with thin, lightweight, composite carbon fiber jackets that provide the necessary degree of confinement to ensure ductile response and also mimic the original design.|$|R
50|$|By late August 1959, all {{residential}} buildings had been removed, with only foundations remaining. After the debris {{had been cleared}} away {{from the site of}} the burnt-down grain elevators, the wharf was used as a distribution terminal for the Century Coal Company, a subsidiary of Canada Steamship Lines. As the market for coal declined in the late 1950s the docks were silenced once again. By 1959 use of the wharf was acquired by National Steel Corporation for loading pelletized iron ore from its Low Phos Mine at Sellwood. A rail mounted gantry crane was <b>installed</b> along the <b>length</b> of the wharf.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{the initial}} barrier was built {{up into the}} Wall proper, the first {{concrete}} elements and large blocks being put in place on 17 August. During {{the construction of the}} Wall, National People's Army (NVA) and Combat Groups of the Working Class (KdA) soldiers stood in front of it with orders to shoot anyone who attempted to defect. Additionally, chain fences, walls, minefields and other obstacles were <b>installed</b> along the <b>length</b> of East Germany's western border with West Germany proper. A huge no man's land was cleared to provide a clear line of fire at fleeing refugees.|$|R
30|$|Guard rails were <b>installed</b> {{over the}} <b>length</b> of the track bridge to prevent wheel derailment. The {{addition}} of the guard rails also {{had the effect of}} stiffening the frame made up of the rails and bearer bars, thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The guard rails were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the bearer bars using machined pins, and connected to the guard rail of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the guard rails in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum conduit, {{similar to}} {{galvanized}} steel conduit, is a rigid tube, generally used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications where a higher resistance to corrosion is needed. Such locations would include food processing plants, where large amounts of water and cleaning chemicals would make galvanized conduit unsuitable. Aluminum cannot be directly embedded in concrete, since the metal reacts with the alkalis in cement. The conduit may be coated to prevent corrosion by incidental contact with concrete. Aluminum conduit is generally lower cost than steel {{in addition to having}} a lower labor cost to <b>install,</b> since a <b>length</b> of aluminum conduit will have about one-third the weight of an equally-sized rigid steel conduit.|$|R
50|$|Before the mid-20th century, {{coal gas}} was {{produced}} in retorts by heating coal {{in the absence of}} air: the process being known as coal gasification. This was first used for municipal lighting; the gas passed through wooden or metal pipes from the retort to the lantern. The first public piped gas supply was to 13 gas lamps, <b>installed</b> along the <b>length</b> of Pall Mall, London in 1807. The credit for this goes to the German inventor and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation, and this delayed the roll-out of street lighting and the installation of gas for domestic illumination, heating, and cooking.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of laminar flow nacelles for reducing installed engine/nacelle drag was studied. The purpose was twofold: to experimentally verify {{a method for}} designing laminar flow nacelles and {{to determine the effect}} of installation on the extent of laminar flow on the nacelle and on the nacelle pressure distributions. The results of the isolated nacelle tests illustrated that laminar flow could be maintained over the desired <b>length.</b> <b>Installing</b> the nacelles on wing/pylon did not alter the extent of laminar flow occurring on the nacelles.

40|$|Substantial {{research}} has been conducted to advance structural control as a means of mitigating the dynamic response of civil structures. Recently, the structural engineering field has begun exploring low-cost wireless sensors for structural monitoring applications. Wireless sensors can be employed to reduce the labor and costs associated with <b>installing</b> extensive <b>lengths</b> of coaxial wires in today’s structural control systems. In this study, the wireless sensors are designed to perform four major tasks in a control system: (a) collect real-time structural response data; (b) wirelessly transmit or receive response data; (c) process data and compute control decisions; and (d) apply control signals to structural actuators. The demands of the control system to respond in real-time pose as a challenge for wireless sensing and control, due to communication delays between wireless sensors and possible data loss. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing decentralized and partially decentralized control strategies to reduce communication latencies associated with wireless sensor networks. Control algorithms are embedded in a wireless sensor prototype designed for use in a structural control system. Both numerical simulation and experimental results show that decentralized wireless control is viable for future structural control systems, especially wireless ones...|$|R
