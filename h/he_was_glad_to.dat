5|$|Grace {{comments}} {{in his memoirs}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E

He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E

25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be back as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|St-Pierre {{successfully}} {{defended his}} welterweight title against Dan Hardy on March 27, 2010, at UFC 111 {{which took place}} in Newark, NJ. St-Pierre dominated the fight with his wrestling. He caught Hardy in the first round with an armbar, but Hardy refused to tap and eventually fought out of the hold. In the fourth round St-Pierre caught Hardy in a kimura while in the reverse-mount position, but St-Pierre was again unable to finish Hardy before he was able to escape. St-Pierre {{went on to win the}} fight by unanimous decision (50–43, 50–44, 50–45). After the fight, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> win but was not impressed by his performance, stating that he wanted to finish the fight which fans agreed. St-Pierre received harsh criticism for stalling the fight against Hardy and not being able to finish him.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the conclusion of peace Louis renewed his aggressions on the German frontier through the Réunions policy. Engaged in a serious struggle with the Ottoman Empire, the emperor was again slow to move, and although he joined the Association League against France in 1682 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> make a truce at Regensburg two years later. In 1686 the League of Augsburg was formed by the emperor and the imperial princes, to preserve {{the terms of the}} treaties of Westphalia and of Nijmegen. The whole European position was now bound up with events in England, and the tension lasted until 1688, when William III of Orange won the English crown through the Glorious Revolution and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689, the Grand Alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England, Spain and Denmark, the elector of Brandenburg and others, and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout almost the whole of western Europe. In general the several campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September 1697, England, Spain and the United Provinces made peace with France at the Treaty of Rijswijk.|$|E
