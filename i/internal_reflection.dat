40|$|International audienceMost of the time, when an {{electromagnetic}} wave undergoes a transmission in indoor environments, the interacting material thickness is {{taken into account}} to model the wave propagation in an accurate way. Therefore, the wave is considered to undergo multiple reflections inside the material and these <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> have to be modelled if a deterministic propagation tool is used. But we can wonder how many <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> are necessary to correctly describe the transmission phenomenon. In the literature, transmission coefficients are only used with simplifying hypothesis, assuming automatically an infinity of reflections and a Receiver (Rx) far from the interacting material. But the authors have developed their own transmission coefficient, extracted from a correction method presented, which finds the exact rays that undergo multiple reflections inside lossless slabs with no simplifying hypothesis. This new coefficient depends on the <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> number and on the receiver position. This paper focuses {{on the behavior of}} this last coefficient in terms of <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> number. It gives rules for the choice of the maximum number of <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> depending on propagation transmission scenario parameters, i. e. polarization, frequency, Transmitter (Tx) and Rx positions, and interacting material characteristics. Indeed, if we can find rules to fix this maximum number for a given transmission scenario, we can decrease the computation time of the presented coefficient but, also, re strict the length of time windows necessary to display received Ultra Wide Band (UWB) pulses in an indoor environment...|$|R
25|$|Corner reflectors use three flat mirrors {{to reflect}} light back towards its source, {{they may also}} be {{implemented}} with prisms that reflect using total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> that have no mirror surfaces.

25|$|Signal {{strength}} can {{be improved}} by using special geometries, such as a total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> setup which uses a prism to change the angles so they {{are close to the}} critical angles, allowing the SFG signal to be generated at its critical angle, enhancing the signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{propagation}} of {{light through the}} core of an optical fiber is based on total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level, can cause light rays to be reflected in random directions. This is called diffuse reflection or scattering, and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> on the beam pattern and input impedance of integrated lens antennas. A silicon lens was designed and manufactured, and measurements were conducted at a frequency of 100 (impedance) and 500 GHz (beam pattern). A frequency-dependence characterization of the beam pattern clearly showed the existence and impact of <b>internal</b> <b>reflections.</b> The measurements confirmed {{that most of the}} frequency variations of the beam pattern could be attributed to <b>internal</b> <b>reflections,</b> as predicted by the model. An on-wafer measurement strategy for determining the antenna impedance at millimeter -wave frequencies is presented. The validity of the model was also proven by an excellent match of the input impedance measurements and predictions. Not only the level, but also the oscillation on the impedance curve was predicted accurately. Initial space qualification was performed in the form of thermal cycling...|$|R

25|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} photonic crystals {{led to the}} development in 1991 of photonic-crystal fiber, which guides light by diffraction from a periodic structure, rather than by total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The first photonic crystal fibers became commercially available in 2000. Photonic crystal fibers can carry higher power than conventional fibers and their wavelength-dependent properties can be manipulated to improve performance.|$|E
25|$|Photonic-crystal fiber is {{made with}} a regular pattern of index {{variation}} (often {{in the form of}} cylindrical holes that run {{along the length of the}} fiber). Such fiber uses diffraction effects instead of or in addition to total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection,</b> to confine light to the fiber's core. The properties of the fiber can be tailored to a wide variety of applications.|$|E

The uppermost part of the V 1 P 3 cone shows weak layering with subdued <b>internal</b> <b>reflections.</b> Therefore, we anticipate that the V 1 P 3 cone resulted from very rapid deposition of coarse pyroclastic material and ash. The chaotic seismic facies and lack of <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> indicate that the V 1 P 3 cone was built by less than a few occasional highly-explosive eruptions.|$|R

25|$|In optical tweezers, a {{continuous}} evanescent field {{can be created}} when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection).</b> The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection)</b> {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

For the one-dimensional problem the applicability of this method is proved, its specific features are analyzed.

50|$|The {{primary goal}} of many radioglaciological surveys is to measure the {{thickness}} of a body of ice, which is an important boundary condition for ice-flow models. Ice thicknesses greater than 4 km have been measured in East Antarctica. <b>Internal</b> <b>reflections</b> have also been detected in many alpine glaciers and all modern ice sheets. These layers represent the internal stratigraphy and {{can also be used}} to constrain ice-flow models. The shapes of these <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> generally follow the bedrock topography and they are often assumed to be isochronous. Disturbances in these reflections that are unrelated to bedrock topography can be used to understand past ice flow, for example the anticlines arising from the Raymond Effect.|$|R
25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of rectangular waveguide, {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative dielectric waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E
25|$|When light travels from {{a medium}} {{with a higher}} {{refractive}} index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle; {{in this case the}} refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of an}} {{intermediate}} layer to form an anti-reflection coating {{can be thought of}} as analoguous to the technique of impedance matching of electrical signals. (A similar method is used in fibre optic research, where an index-matching oil is sometimes used to temporarily defeat total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> so that light may be coupled into or out of a fiber.) Further reduced reflection could in theory be made by extending the process to several layers of material, gradually blending the refractive index of each layer between the index of the air and the index of the substrate.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} time {{analysis}} of multiple <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> during one-dimensional tunneling of non-relativistic particles and photons with sub-barrier energies through potential barriers. The approach exploited {{is a simple}} analytic continuation from real (over-barrier) wave numbers to imaginary (sub-barrier) wave numbers. It is shown in particular that not only the general effective tunneling velocity, but also every effective transmission (tunneling) velocity {{for at least the}} first intermediate stage between successive <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> is superluminal. An interpretation of this seemingly strange fact is given in terms of an effective deformation of spacetime inside the barrier.

25|$|Rainbows are {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops. A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with the sun 180° away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon.|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from polyvinyl acetate or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as multi-directional waveguide arrays. Prism arrays show an overall 5% increase in the total solar energy conversion. Active coatings that convert infrared light into visible light have shown a 30% increase.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{begins with}} the {{modeling}} of the re-flected waves within integrated lens antennas, which consist of a dielectric lens on which a planar antenna is mounted. It is demonstrated that if the relative dielectric constant of the lens is small (" r 4), the single- and double-reflected waves are sufficient to analyze {{the effect of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>reflections.</b> For small angles around boresight, these unwanted reflected fields mainly affect the cross-polar far-field pattern, while for large observation angles, both the co-polar and cross-polar patterns are significantly disturbed. It appears that by neglecting the internally reflected field contributions, the beam efficiency may be overestimated more than 10 %. In this paper, two types of matching layers are analyzed in order to reduce these unwanted reflections. It is demonstrated that the radiation performances of the integrated lens antennas with optimum-thickness and quarter-wavelength matching layer are almost equal. Even for low dielectric-constant lenses, the beam efficiency can be increased by over 10 %. Finally, it is demonstrated that the <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> may also have a strong effect on the antenna admittance, which can only be reduced partly by the use of a matching layer.
