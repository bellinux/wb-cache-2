40|$|The vast {{majority}} of the research efforts in <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{over the past several years}} has focused on the generation of precise and almost exact measures for the working schedule presupposing complete information and a deterministic environment. During execution, however, production may be the subject of considerable variability, which may lead to frequent schedule interruptions. Adopting biological control principles refers to the process where a schedule is developed prior to the start of the processing after considering all the parameters requirements at a machine and updated accordingly as the process executes. This research reviews the best practices in gene transcription and translation control methods and adopts these principles in the development of an autonomous <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> control logic aimed at reducing excessive use of manual input in planning tasks. With autonomous decision-making functionality, <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> will as much as practicably possible be able to respond autonomously to process variability by deployment of proactive scheduling procedures that may be used to revise or re-optimize the schedule when variability process requirements is noted. The novelty of this work is the ability for processing machine to autonomous take decisions just as decisions are taken by autonomous entities in the process of gene transcription and translation. The idea has been implemented by the integration of simulation modelling techniques with Taguchi analysis to investigate the contributions of <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> factors, and determination of the ‘what if’ scenarios encountered due to the existence of variability in production processes. The control logic adopts the induction rules as used in gene expression control mechanisms, studied in biological systems. Scheduling factors are identified to that effect and are investigated to find their effects on selected performance metrics for each machine used. How they are used to deal with variability in process is one major objective for this research as it is because of the variability that autonomous decision making becomes of interest. Although different scheduling techniques have been applied and are successful in production planning and control, the results obtained from the inclusion of the autonomous <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> control logic has proved that significant improvement can still be achieved. This research demonstrated that the correct choice of values for <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> factors has a great impact on the performance measurements, such that, high throughput rate can be reached with a bigger batch size, lower percentage of rework, and shorter stoppages. Quicker movement of goods through the facility means better utilisation of assets. Better utilisation of assets creates additional capacity resulting from faster throughput thereby improving customer satisfaction through quicker delivery. It has also been shown that %waiting, %blocking and %stoppage makes it possible to examine different manufacturing constraints as well as the relationship between non-utilisation and different performance measurements...|$|E

40|$|A new {{technology}} for producing <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>schedules</b> {{has been developed}} in response to complex requirements for operating space systems such as the Space Shuttle, the Space Station, and the Deep Space Network for telecommunications. This technology has proven its effectiveness in manufacturing environments where popular scheduling techniques associated with Materials Resources Planning (MRPII) and with factory simulation are not adequate for shop-floor work planning and control. The technology has three components. The first {{is a set of}} data structures that accommodate an extremely general description of a factory's resources, its manufacturing activities, and the constraints imposed by the environment. The second component is a language and set of software utilities that enable a rapid synthesis of functional capabilities. The third component is an algorithmic architecture called the Five Ruleset Model which accommodates the unique needs of each factory. Using the {{new technology}}, systems can model activities that generate, consume, and/or obligate resources. This allows work-in-process (WIP) to be generated and used; it permits constraints to be imposed or intermediate as well as finished goods inventories. It is also possible to match as closely as possible both the current factory state and future conditions such as promise dates. Schedule revisions can be accommodated without impacting the entire production schedule. Applications have been successful in both discrete and process manufacturing environments. The availability of a high-quality <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> production planning capability enhances the data management capabilities of MRP II systems.

AutoSched efficiently schedules {{all of the}} constraints in your factory, such as shift schedules, work setup rules, batching, preventative maintenance, machine efficiency, and operator skill classes. With AutoSched, you can identify your bottleneck resources and apply intelligent operating rules to improve performance. One manufacturer reduced its average cycle time from 25 to 5 days, and reduced inprocess inventory to one-fifth previous levels using AutoSched. Scheduling with AutoSched allows you to set accurate commit dates, based on the current mix of work, available resources, and existing commit dates. AutoSched uses the AutoMod TM simulation system, AutoSimulations' proprietary simulation technology. AutoMod provides the discrete event simulation engine, 3 -D graphics, and material handling constructs that are the foundation for AutoSched. Built-in task selection rules in AutoSched allow you to model how machines and personnel select tasks to increase factory performance. You can also easily customize AutoSched with an engineering-oriented, English-like language that provides the flexibility to create custom task selection rules. In addition to scheduling, the AutoSched planning tool {{can be used for}} capacity analysis. Simulation technology makes it possible for you to quickly and easily consider what if questions such as, "What new equipment do we need to buy for producing the new product?"

40|$|Abstract:- The {{production}} costs reduction {{in a highly}} competitive environment is a critical success factor. In particular, in fields where outsourcing is used frequently {{and the impact of}} the material costs is high, a significant cost reduction can be achieved making more efficient value chain. Moreover, the use of outsourcing is a way to adjust production capacity depending on demand. Therefore the coordination and planning of the various rings of the chain and the estimate of the productive capability of the various production units become fundamental for a coherent evaluation of promised delivery times. More and more frequently and in greater detail the Companies at the “end of the network ” require, through capacity assessment a verification of the available productive capacity of the manufacturing units, both from a quality and quantity point of view, that each single firm can dedicate to a certain type of production. In this paper it is presented a simulation model that allows the elaboration of an operative plan of production through the verification of <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> of resources. The model tends to minimize costs of stocking and set-up, considering other {{production costs}} as constant. The simulation is a technique that allows the checking with better precision of the use of the resources with variation of the ties. This approach lead to a high performing instrument in the field of the advanced planning and scheduling through analysis of the various possible views. The auxiliary use of the optimizing tool available in the ARENA software allows an optimal solution, confirming the validity of the study of new applications of the simulative instrument for the verification of productive capacity in the short term.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{functions}} of an MRP system is to issue rescheduling messages that urge the planner tospeed up or slow down open orders. It seems in practice that these messages are not used at all by planners. This is mostly due to the inaccuracy of MRP, that more or less ignores safety time, safety stocks and lotsize flexibility in the calculation of reschedule-in messages. Reschedule-out messages are usually ignored because planners {{do not see the}} value of the message. Other reasons for not adhering to rescheduling messages are a lack of maintenance of MRP parameters or simply the wrong use of the MRP function. In the future, MRP rescheduling functionality will be used even less than today, due to the changing role of MRP within the planning framework. With the uprise of <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> packages, MRP is being pushed one level upward in the planning hierarchy.

Effects of these factors on the performance measures were statistically analyzed based on a real situation of an auto-part factory. Statistical results showed that the dispatching rules and objective function weights had significant effects on the performance measures of the proposed FCMRP system.

40|$|Abstract. The drum-buffer-rope (DBR) is a {{scheduling}} technique {{under the}} Theory of Constraints (TOC) philosophy. In DBR, “drum ” is a schedule at the bottleneck, “rope ” is {{a mechanism to}} release the required material to the bottleneck, and “buffer ” is used to protect the bottleneck from starvation due to statistical fluctuations. For a non-identical parallel machine flow shop environment, estimating rope and time buffer {{is not an easy}} task because of the complexity of non-identical parallel machine loading. This paper proposes a new scheduling method, which is called modified DBR (ModDBR). It uses a backward <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> technique instead of the rope in traditional DBR. A simulation model is constructed to investigate the effect of the loading methods, priority dispatching rules, and load levels on tardiness, earliness, flow time, and bottleneck’s utilization. The results show that ModDBR tends to outperform other loading methods in terms of tardiness, average flow time, and bottleneck utilization. However, ModDBR is inferior to others in term of earliness. These findings are still valid when bottleneck location and protective capacity level are changed...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of <b>finite</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>scheduling</b> tools which are in use and {{available}} to industry. To be fully effective, a scheduling system needs to be incorporated within a control methodology which enables shop-floor performance to be analysed and, when necessary, corrective actions to be formulated. Manufacturing system performance, however, is not only dependent upon short-term planning decisions, but is also constrained by the capability for which it is designed. Hence, any control methodology should be based on a consistent set of performance measures and well defined procedures which help to integrate decision making at all levels in the order fulfilment process. The paper examines the distinctive roles of process optimisation and process control in the decision hierarchy; it classifies a set of measures of performance and other system variables according to the functions they serve in manufacturing control, and suggests a hierarchical process control methodology.
