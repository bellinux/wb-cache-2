40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for contingent claim pricing in a preannounced policy. There are some properties in the model. First, one can distinguish the preannouncement effects on the mean and volatility of asset returns. Second, the European call option pricing solution in the model can reduce to the Black-Sholes (1973) formula as no preannouncement effects occur before maturity.

40|$|We {{construct}} a binomial tree model fitting all moments to the approximated geometric Brownian motion. Our construction generalizes the classical Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, the Jarrow-Rudd, and the Tian binomial tree models. The new binomial model {{is used to}} resolve a <b>discontinuity</b> problem in <b>option</b> pricing...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{solutions}} of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs contain shocks {{or develop}} <b>discontinuities.</b> One <b>option</b> {{for improving the}} numerical treatment of the spurious oscillations that occur near these artifacts is {{through the application of}} a limiter. The cells where such treatment is necessary are referred to as troubled cells. In this article, we discuss the multiwavelet troubled-cell indicator that was introduced by Vuik and Ryan (J Comput Phys 270 : 138 â€“ 160, 2014). We focus on the relation between the highest-level multiwavelet coefficients and jumps in (derivatives of) the DG approximation. Based on this information, we slightly modify the original multiwavelet troubled-cell indicator. Furthermore, we show one-dimensional test cases using the modified multiwavelet troubled-cell indicator...|$|R
