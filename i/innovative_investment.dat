40|$|Firms {{have embraced}} {{electronic}} commerce {{as a means}} of doing business, either because they see {{it as a way to}} improve efficiency, grow market share, expand into new markets, or because they view it as essential for survival. Recent research in the United States provides some evidence that the market does value investments in electronic commerce. Following research that suggests that, in certain circumstances, the market values noninnovative investments as well as <b>innovative</b> <b>investments</b> in new products, we partition electronic commerce investment project announcements into innovative and noninnovative to determine whether there are excess returns associated with these types of announcements. Apart from our overall results being consistent with the United States findings that the market values investments in electronic commerce projects, we also find that noninnovative investments are perceived as more valuable to the firm than <b>innovative</b> <b>investments.</b> On average, the market expects <b>innovative</b> <b>investments</b> to earn a return commensurate with their risk. We conclude that innovative electronic commerce projects are most likely seen by the capital market as easily replicable, and consequently have little, if any, competitive advantage period. On the other hand, we conclude from the noninnovative investment results that these types of investments are seen as being compatible with a firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets-in-place, in particular, its information technology capabilities, a view consistent with the resource-based view of the firm...|$|R

40|$|Why is R&D {{spending}} so low in Spanish firms? One possible answer {{may lie in}} a small contribution of <b>innovative</b> <b>investments</b> to value creation at the firm level. When pulling together complementary sources of spending data and related evidence to measure these investments, we observe that R&D is low for international standards, but overall intangible investment seems adequate. Data from the Central de Balances are then {{used to assess the}} effect of R&D and other <b>innovative</b> <b>investments</b> on the value of Spanish firms. The results suggest that intangible investments {{have a positive impact on}} market values which is more substantial for innovative sectors, and this is also the case for R&D capital. Such a positive impact is influenced by the size of the firm and its presence in the stock market. In fact, an alternative explanation to low R&D intensity could be found in the small fraction of firms publicly traded in the stock market in Spain, as far as equity holders tend to value intangible assets more than bond holders. Consequently, promoting a more active role of market valuations might be a promising policy. ...|$|R

Modern theories of assessment of public administration productivity are guided by the process approach when it is expedient {{to carry out the}} formation of business processes of regional executive authorities according to strategic indicators of territorial development. In this regard, there is a problem of modeling of interrelation of indicators of social and economic development of the region and quantitative indices of results of business processes of executive authorities. At the first stage of modeling, two main directions of strategic development, namely <b>innovative</b> and <b>investment</b> activity of regional economic systems are considered. In this regard, the work presents the results of modeling the interrelation between the indicators of regional social and economic development and <b>innovative</b> and <b>investment</b> activity. Therefore, for carrying out the analysis, the social and economic system of the region is presented in space of the main indicators of social and economic development of the territory and indicators of <b>innovative</b> and <b>investment</b> activity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the role of}} {{replacement}} and innovation activity in shaping investment behavior and labor productivity in a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 2001. Investment is concentrated about large investment episodes, or investment spikes, whose nature varies by observable firm characteristics. We find evidence of replacement activity as a determinant of investment spikes for those firms that {{are not involved in}} process innovation nor plant expansion. Then we explore how large investment episodes transmit into the evolution of labor productivity under different innovative strategies. We find that expansionary and innovative firms increase their productivity after an investment spike. However, long learning curves seems to be associated with <b>innovative</b> <b>investments.</b> 333...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of the growth diagnostics methodology was {{a case study of}} El Salvador, described in the paper [...] "Growth Diagnostics", co-authored by Dani Rodrik and Andrès Velasco. At the time, the country had good macroeconomic indicators, decent institutions, low interest rates and returns to education. However, it was investing little. According to the authors, the growth diagnostics methodology revealed that in the end, the low investment in El Salvador could be brought back to a problem of self-discovery: the country was losing its traditional industries and it was unclear what it should invest in next. This lack of <b>innovative</b> <b>investment</b> ideas, then, was El Salvador's most binding constraint on growth. Since the publication of this paper, the growth diagnostics strategy has been adopted by a number of international institutions including the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the UK’s Department for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The PREM network currently collects country case studies that use the growth diagnostics methodology.|$|E

Our GMM-SYS estimates generate various results, which are partially in contrast with the extant literature. Indeed, estimations carried out on the entire sample do not provide statistically significant evidence of the expected labor-friendly nature of innovation. More in detail, neither R&D nor <b>investment</b> in <b>innovative</b> machineries and equipment (the so-called embodied technological change, ETC) turn out to have any significant employment effect.

40|$|In recent years, the {{increase}} in competitiveness, {{as a result of}} the economic globalization and crisis, has caused the bankruptcy of many Italian small family businesses working in traditional industries. Meanwhile, family firms that have been working in a perspective of process and product innovation have been able to maintain a durable competitive advantage. In particular, enterprises that have shown a particular vitality are spin-offs, founded by an innovator entrepreneur with an academic background: these have often found their funding in self-financing and family and public resources in the pre-seed and seed stages of the project. However, these spin-offs often have difficulty financing the start-up phase of the project with external resources due to risk and informational opacity related to innovative processes. The literature grounded on innovation funding has highlighted the informative opacity problem mainly caused by family entrepreneurs' difficulty to communicate innovation characteristics and commercial potential to financial markets and by the inability to identify individuals who are more available to finance <b>innovative</b> <b>investments.</b> Therefore, it is particularly difficult for investors to assess family small- and medium-sized enterprises' economic feasibility of innovative projects.

40|$|The {{amount of}} cost {{reduction}} or effective R & D {{that results in}} a symmetric sequential Nash equilibrium with quadratic payoffs and differentiated goods, is shown to increase with spillovers in oligopolies with a 'few' rivals and to achieve a maximum for spillovers that are not perfect in industries with 'many' firms. Similar tendencies apply for consumer surplus, profits and static welfare. More rivals typically lead to reduced investments, output and profitability, while consumer surplus and welfare increase, or at least do not decrease. Limited entry in markets with a 'few' rivals may enhance <b>innovative</b> <b>investments,</b> profitability and consumer surplus, if only product differentiation and spillovers are sufficiently high and R & D costs sufficiently low.
