The UN has said Israel has withdrawn the bulk of its troops from Lebanon, fulfilling a key condition of the UN ceasefire ending war with Hezbollah, but that some Israeli troops remained in Ghajar. The IDF confirmed its forces were still operating near Ghajar, a village split in two by the border.

In 6 months, however, 11 Palestinians civilians, including four children, had been killed by Israeli fire and at least 70 Palestinian civilians were injured in the same period, including at least 49 who were working collecting rubble and scrap metal.|$|E
25|$|These {{traumatic}} experiences {{may have}} influenced Akhras' attempts to join one of the Palestinian resistance groups. However, Israeli intelligence reports indicate that Akhras was impregnated by a Fatah operative, despite being an unmarried teenager, and that the emotional and social consequences of her unplanned pregnancy were the primary reason she decided to commit a suicide attack. Akhras first tried to {{join the ranks of}} Hamas, which turned her away because of a long-standing policy against allowing females to fight in physical combatcitation needed. Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for many suicide bombings in <b>Israel</b> <b>says</b> that the basis for this rule lies in teachings of the Qur'an that says Jihad is the domain of the male. Despite this, Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad (which generally also only recruits males) have since each used female suicide bombers. In 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin made a statement to the press after Akhras' bombing saying that the group would only use women after they ran out of men.|$|E

The 2007 development project in east Ma'ale Adumim was supported by Ariel Sharon in 2005.

[...] In Haaretz, columnist Bradley Burston wrote that the Foreign Ministry's refusal to meet with the U.S. congressmembers was [...] "a gratuitous move breathtaking in its haughtiness, its ignorance of and disrespect for the United States and the American Jewish community". He said that the Foreign Ministry considered J Street [...] "guilty of the crime of explicitly calling itself pro-Israel, while not agreeing wholeheartedly with everything the government of <b>Israel</b> <b>says</b> and does". Haviv Rettig Gur, writing in The Jerusalem Post, said that [...] "J Street won a small victory" [...] in the incident. [...] "If American legislators with pro-Israel records say J Street is kosher", Gur wrote, [...] "that creates a new political reality with which the Israeli Right must contend." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{definitively}} {{known cause}} of grisi siknis, {{although there are}} some theories which attempt to explain its origin. Although it has not discovered organic cause, says Dennis, grisi siknis still [...] "follow the classic model for contagious disease". Dennis claims that grisi siknis {{is the source of the}} emotionally volatile Miskito culture, saying [...] "it is clear that grisi siknis is related to emotional upset, worry, fear and general anxiety", while microorganisms, if involved, are intermediate. Dr. Ronald C. Simons, professor emeritus of psychiatry and anthropology at Michigan State University, as quoted by Nicola Ross in The Walrus magazine, upholds this argument, proposing that grisi siknis is caused by poverty and stress among the Miskito. Culturally bound syndromes, Simons says, are often strongly influenced by behavior and experience and have become a local way of expressing misfortune. Dr. Wolfgang Jilek, of the University of Columbia’s psychiatry department, also quoted by Ross in The Walrus, calls culturally bound syndromes [...] "real" [...] despite a general lack of evidence for organic causes. They are primarily the result of trauma and stress, Jilek claims, that end in mental dissociation problems. Susan Kellogg, Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at the University of Houston, says that grisi siknis is the result of the cultural [...] "physical and emotional stresses" [...] that Miskito women endure. Shlomo Ariel, Co-Director of the Integrative Psychotherapy Center in Ramat Gan, <b>Israel,</b> <b>says</b> that such disorders are the product of the culture, delineates [...] acceptable coping mechanisms for dealing with external or internal changes. In a typical homeostatic function, Ariel says, [...] "emotional or behavioral disorders in the individual are defined as such by the culture", which culture subsequently imposes treatment in order to restore equilibrium. Grisi siknis can be considered a ritualized behavior associated with the adolescent to adult transition [...] among the Miskito, says Mark Jamieson, professor of social anthropology at the University of Manchester. Girls in Miskito culture, claims Jamieson, are faced with the culturally inconsistent task of attracting a husband sexually while remaining safe and pure to maintain societal status quo. The contradictory familial pressures to both protect and marry off the daughter adds to this. Thus, says Shlomo, [...] "the syndrome may be viewed as a safety valve" [...] to maintain equilibrium between these conflicting pressures. Miskito girls express transitional sexuality through the syndrome while maintaining social purity, with the culture holding the victims blameless for their actions while attacked by the disease.|$|E
