We find that bankruptcy costs are very heterogeneous and sensitive to measurement method. Still, Chapter 7 liquidations appear no faster or cheaper (in terms of <b>direct</b> <b>expense)</b> than Chapter 11 bankruptcies. But Chapter 11 seems to preserve assets better, and thereby allows creditors to recover relatively more. Our paper also provides {{a large number of}} further empirical regularities. ...|$|R

[...] Westerns were popular with audiences, but critics lamented the loss of other program formats, which had quietly vanished from the three networks' schedules.

Holding cost also includes the opportunity cost of reduced responsiveness to customers' changing requirements, slowed introduction of improved items, and the inventory's value and <b>direct</b> <b>expenses,</b> since that money could be used for other purposes.|$|E

The company brought an action for money had and received against the widow, seeking restitution of the mistaken payment. Analysed in modern language, the widow had been enriched at the company's <b>direct</b> <b>expense.</b> The 'unjust factor' was mistake: the company had conferred the benefit whilst labouring under the incorrect tacit assumption that the payment was due.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of Web applications {{is an important}} focus of the modern information enabled organization – whether the Web application development is in-house, outsourced, or purchased as ‘commercial-off-the-shelf’ (COTS) software. Traditionally Web application development has been delivered via the dominant waterfall system. The waterfall system relies upon well-defined governance structures, linear phases, gating, and extensive reporting and sign-off documentation. An increasing number of development stakeholders criticise the waterfall system for web application development. The criticisms include a disproportionate focus on governance and process at the <b>direct</b> <b>expense</b> of flexibility and, most importantly, reduced productivity. One consequence of these criticisms is the increasing adoption of Web application development via agile-system methods. This agile-system approach centres upon smaller design teams, fewer development phases, and shorter development time tables...|$|R
40|$|Allocating among {{competing}} users {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult and vexing problems in fisheries management, and direct allocation under open access is especially contentious, since groups gain only at the <b>direct</b> <b>expense</b> of others. This paper evaluates the direct allocation of Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) among competing offshore and onshore user groups that fish off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California in the USA, the process of achieving that allocation, and the value of economic analysis in the process. The paper also discusses the technique of cost-benefit analysis for direct allocation of total allowable catches among competing user groups and access to the resource. The paper concludes with observations on the role of economic analysis for fisheries management decisions. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} with multimillion-dollar United States political campaigns, <b>direct</b> <b>expenses</b> for the comparatively short campaigns before Japanese general, upper house, and local elections are relatively modest. The use of posters and pamphlets is strictly regulated, and candidates {{appear on the}} noncommercial public television station, NHK, to give short campaign speeches. Most of this activity is publicly funded. Campaign sound-trucks wove their way through urban and rural streets, often bombarding residents with earsplitting harangues from candidates or their supporters.

50|$|Restitutio ad integrum or {{restitutio in integrum}} is a Latin term {{which means}} {{restoration}} to original condition. It {{is one of the}} primary guiding principles behind the awarding of damages in common law negligence claims. The general rule, as the principle implies, is that the amount of compensation awarded should put the successful plaintiff in the position he or she would have been had the tortious action not been committed. Thus the plaintiff should clearly be awarded damages for <b>direct</b> <b>expenses</b> such as medical bills and property repairs and the loss of future earnings attributable to the injury (which often involves difficult speculation about the future career and promotion prospects).|$|E
50|$|Gains {{and losses}} on loans, derivatives, {{financial}} instruments and intangibles are taxed {{as well as}} income. The basic rule for calculating Case III profits is to follow the accounts, although there are detailed anti-avoidance rules to stop the most obvious abuses. Only <b>direct</b> <b>expenses,</b> such as costs incurred in obtaining a loan, are deductible in the Case III computation. If the result is negative, Case III profits are taken as nil, with the negative result being treated as non-trading debits. Similar calculation rules apply to loans, derivatives, financial instruments and intangibles that are taxed under Case I (although losses are treated as a Case I expense rather than non-trading debits).|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{factors that}} hinder {{the installation of}} high-performance heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment in commercial and residential buildings in the United States. For owner-occupied buildings, the utility and capital expenses are ultimately included in one corporate budget. Thus, decision processes become a justification of any additional expense for higher performing equipment relative to the expected returns via lower energy costs. In an existing building, business management principles determine the evaluation process. Certain economic factors apply regardless of building ownership. For example, a cost {{is associated with the}} information gathering process for new technology or obtaining information relevant to current resource use.

50|$|With {{any of the}} concepts, whether {{considering}} the intrinsic value of education or the externally perceived value, each unit of educational attainment requires forgone earnings to attain.

Outside of forgone monetary earnings, there are also <b>direct</b> <b>expenses</b> such as tuition, supplies, books, etc. one must consider when acquiring education, as well as less direct psychic costs. With this there is an economic consideration and tradeoff an individual must consider in their further education aspirations. One who has resources and the desire to continue education has a significant comparative advantage to an individual who by comparison does not. This financial aspect of educational acquirement proves as yet another consideration in the reproductive nature of education.|$|E
