40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} mainly with hyperventilation as it affects aircrew. A literature survey {{has been carried}} out on the causes and effects of hyperventilation and on its investigation and incidence in flight. Measurements of end tidal carbon dioxide tensions (PETCO 2) were made during an anxiety-provoking experimental procedure. These measurements confirmed that anxiety can cause hyperventilation to such a level that the imposition of other stresses found in the flight environment could be expected to cause a performance decrement. Present methods for studying the incidence of <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> are unsatisfactory for various reasons. An attempt was made to develop a simple test for hyperventilation based on a rebreathing estimate of mixed venous carbon dioxide tension. However, examination of the results and a further examination of the basic physiology revealed that the procedure was unlikely to be fruitful. Further experiments were carried out to study the effects of hyperventilation on various respiratory variables and on the time course of the subsequent recovery. It was found that the carbon dioxide cost of hyperventilation was more than that found by other investigators, although estimates of other respiratory variables agreed with those found by further authors in similar circumstances; the possible reasons for this are discussed. Studies of psychomotor performance carried out at the same time failed to demonstrate a consistent decrement in performance with hypocapnia. Further experiments were carried out which suggest that the previously reported decrements in psychomotor performance during hypocapnia are related more to decrements in motor performance than to decrements in intellectual performance. Finally, suggestions are made for further work to be carried out in the same field...|$|E

In all 12 study patients, anginal attacks accompanied by electrocardiographic (ECG) changes (ST elevation in 11 patients and ST depression in I patient) were induced by hyperventilation. Coronary angiography was performed on 11 of the 12 patients, and coronary artery spasm with the same ECG changes was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine in all 11. The plasma fibrinopeptide A levels increased significantly from 2. 0 ± 0. 4 to 10. 0 ± 2. 4 ng/ml during the attack (p < 0. 001) in the study patients, but remained unchanged before and after <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> the control subjects. The plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 remained unchanged after <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> both groups.

40|$|The role of <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> the {{aetiology}} {{of panic}} attacks is still unclear. This paper briefly reviews {{the role of}} hyperventilation and abnormal respiration to panic attacks and examines the experimental evidence. Evidence {{has been found that}} physiological variables such as paCO 2 and pH are involved in the aetiology of panic attacks and panic disorder but the extent {{and the nature of the}} involvement of cognitive variables is undetermined. Based on current evidence, there is a need to integrate cognitive variables with the physiological framework proposed by the hyperventilation theory. Until clear experimental evidence is produced about the relationships between cognitive and physiological factors, the applicability of <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> the aetiology and treatment of panic attacks remains in question...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently {{we found}} that {{patients}} with blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia tend to hyperventilate when exposed to feared stimuli. Hyperventilation results from increases in minute ventilation above levels required by metabolic demand and can result from increases in either frequency or depth of breathing, {{or a combination of}} both. METHOD: In order to determine which of these factors contributed most to <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> BII phobia we analyzed breathing patterns of BII phobia patients (N= 12) and non-anxious controls (N= 14), recorded with respiratory inductance plethysmography. Participants viewed ten film clips of either an emotionally positive, negative, or neutral quality, as well as surgery and asthma-relevant clips. During five film clips (one from each category) they also tensed their leg muscles. RESULTS: Minute ventilation was markedly increased in blood phobia patients compared to other groups during surgery films. Also, tidal volume and irregularity of tidal volume showed strong increases, while respiration rate was not affected. Leg muscle tension increased ventilation in general but far below the extent brought about by <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> BII phobia. Patients who were breathing deeper during exposure reported stronger symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness and faintness. In general, patients showed a higher rate of spontaneous sighs throughout all film presentations, but not at baseline. CONCLUSION: Thus, <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> blood phobia is produced by excessively deep and irregular breathing and may contribute to fainting responses. Behavioral interventions for BII phobia could benefit from attention to this aspect of dysfunctional breathing...|$|R

40|$|Article abstract—Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{nystagmus}} evoked by <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma {{and to use}} this information to predict the effects of hyperventilation on individual ampullary nerves. Methods: Three-dimensional scleral search coil eye movement recording techniques were used to record the magnitude and time course of eye movements in six patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. The presenting complaints in five of these patients were vertigo or dysequilibrium. Results: The eye movement response to hyperventilation was a “recovery ” nystagmus with slow-phase components corresponding to excitation of the affected vestibular nerve. Projection of the eye velocity vector into {{the plane of the}} semicircular canals revealed that fibers arising from the ampulla of the horizontal canal were most affected by hyperventilation with lesser activation of fibers to the superior canal and smaller, more variable responses from posterior canal fibers. Conclusions: The three-dimensional characteristics of the nystagmus evoked by <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> patients with vestibular schwannoma provide insight into the vestibular end organs affected by the tumor and the mechanism responsible for the nystagmus. This finding indicates that <b>hyperventilation</b> resulted <b>in</b> a transient increase in activity from these partially demyelinated axons.

40|$|A double blind, placebo {{controlled}} comparison {{was made}} of the effects of nebulised ipratropium bromide (0. 05 and 0. 5 mg) and salbutamol (0. 25 and 2. 5 mg) on lung function and the airway response to <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> eight normal subjects. Both agents at both doses caused similar baseline bronchodilatation, confirming the presence of resting bronchomotor tone. The overall mean increases as percentages of control were 33 % in specific airway conductance (sGaw), 10 % in maximal flow after expiration of 50 % of vital capacity, and 3. 7 % in FEV 1. Hypocapnia (mean end tidal carbon dioxide tension 2. 2 kPa) was produced by three minutes of voluntary <b>hyperventilation</b> and resulted <b>in</b> a mean fall in sGaw of 0. 49 s- 1 kPa- 1 (20 %). After inhalation of 0. 25 mg salbutamol hypocapnic hyperventilation still produced a mean fall in sGaw of 0. 55 s- 1 kPa- 1, whereas salbutamol 2. 5 mg reduced this response to 0. 15 s- 1 kPa- 1 (6 %). After both doses of ipratropium the decrease in sGaw caused by hyperventilation was similar to the control. This suggests that bronchoconstriction in response to hypocapnic <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> normal subjects is not mediated via a cholinergic reflex...|$|R

Pulmonary air embolism {{was produced by}} air infusion 0. 1 ml/kg/min. for 10 minuten (0. 1 ml/kg) via inserted pulmonary artery catheter; endotracheal anesthetized dogs with fentanyl and vecuronium bromide under mechanical ventilation. We measured hemodynamic variables and pH, blood gas (arterial, mixed venous blood) at baseline, post-air infusion and after recovered pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). In addition PAP recovery-times were counted. As results, PAP recovery-times <b>in</b> <b>hyperventilation</b> group (pH= 7. 50, PaCO₂= 25 mmHg) were attenuated significantly compared with normoventilation (control) group (pH= 7. 40, PaCO₂= 40 mmHg); these values were 14. 2 ± 5. 2 min. versus 17. 8 ± 6. 0 min. (n= 8, p< 0. 05). On the threshould air volume of paradoxical air-embolism, we confirmed air bubbles in the left atrium and/or aorta with using transesophageal echocardiography and recognized 0. 75 ± 0. 27 ml/kg (hyperventilation group), and 0. 83 ± 0. 26 ml/kg (control) respectively; {{there were no significant}} differences related to the ventilation-modus.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that hyperventilation modifies {{the features of the}} nystagmus in cerebellar patients (Walker and Zee, 1999). It has been hypothesized that hyperventilation influences the oculomotor control through a metabolic effect on cerebellar calcium channels, which {{play a critical role in}} the firing behaviour of neuronal populations in the cerebellum. This hypothesis has been tested here by analysing fast goal-directed limb movements before and after <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA- 6), a disease associated with a polyglutamine expansion in the α 1 -A voltage-dependent calcium channel. Cerebellar hypermetria associated with fast distal single-joint movements was found to be increased following <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>in</b> patients presenting SCA- 6 but remained unchanged in patients with idiopathic late-onset cerebellar degeneration (ILOCA). This is a new provocative test to enhance distal dysmetria in SCA- 6. The present results strengthen the hypothesis of Walker and Zee. It is suggested that hyperventilation enhances the defective calcium transfers in SCA- 6, resulting in an impairment of the calcium influx in particular into Purkinje cells involved in the control of fast goal-directed voluntary movements.
