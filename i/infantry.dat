5|$|After an {{extensive}} refit {{in the aftermath}} of the Unsan battle, ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division was placed on the US I Corps right flank at Yongsan-dong on November 20. As part of the Home-by-Christmas Offensive, the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division was to advance north and to capture the town of Taechon while the US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment of the US 25th <b>Infantry</b> Division was advancing north from Yongsan-dong on the Korean right flank. At the same time, the US 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division of the US I Corps would advance towards Chongju on the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division's left flank.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the troops}} {{returned}} from France, the British Army began implementing {{lessons learned from the}} campaign and re-organizing formations. As part of this, the army's five motor divisions (made up of two brigades) were to be reformed as regular <b>infantry</b> divisions (made up of three brigades). As a result, the 66th <b>Infantry</b> Division was disbanded on 23 June. The 197th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade was transferred to the 59th (Staffordshire) <b>Infantry</b> Division, the 198th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade went to the 1st London Division, and the 199th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade was assigned to the 55th (West Lancashire) <b>Infantry</b> Division.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battle}} around Taechon {{dragged into the}} night of November 26, the ROK 11th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment on the division's right became disorganized. Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division soon brought up the 15th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment from his reserve to relieve the 11th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment. After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. As the morning came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not stop their assault even under punishing UN air strikes, {{and some of the}} attacks spilled into US 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division's area. Upon noticing their flank was buckling, the US 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division and the US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment started the retreat southward to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E

5|$|As {{the guards}} brigades reached their objectives, the newly gained ground was {{gradually}} {{turned over to}} reserve HV units. The 163rd <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, defending Dubrovnik during the JNA siege, took over positions captured by the 4th Guards Brigade. The 1st Guards Brigade was relieved and its territorial gains were garrisoned by elements of the 115th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, the 145th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, the 148th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, a battalion of the 156th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade and a company of the 102nd <b>Infantry</b> Brigade. The VRS counter-attacked the reserve <b>infantry</b> on 9 July, causing losses and {{the withdrawal of the}} 102nd <b>Infantry</b> Brigade company east of Zavala and the 115th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade from Zavala and Orahov Do. The retreat created a gap in the HV defences, threatening the town of Slano, but the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade closed it. Days later, the 148th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade conceded some of the offensive's gains to another VRS counter-attack near Bobani. On 13 July, a platoon drawn from the 2nd Guards Brigade attempted to capture the Vlaštica Peak, but the attack failed, marking the end of Operation Tiger.|$|E
5|$|At 1 p.m. on November 27, Peng {{ordered the}} PVA 66th Corps {{to destroy the}} ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division before the Koreans could retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. On the evening of November 27, the PVA 66th Corps {{launched}} a massive attack against the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division, the US 5th Regimental Combat Team of the 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division and the US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment. After midnight, the Chinese attacks broke through the Korean lines and captured Yongsan-dong, resulting {{in the loss of}} the ROK 11th, 15th and US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment's command posts. The ROK 11th and 15th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment were soon scattered while the retreating US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment was blocked at Yongsan-dong with Chinese forces attacking from behind. Under heavy pressure, the US 35th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment fought its way through the town and rejoined the US 25th Division on the afternoon of November 28. At the same time, Paik rallied the broken ROK regiments and recaptured Yongsan-dong. The ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> Division held the town against the subsequent Chinese attacks until it withdrew from the battle on November 29.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army saw further {{drawdowns}} and {{reductions in}} spending.

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars the cavalry's main {{offensive}} {{role was}} as shock troops.

5|$|Early on 7 April, {{reconnaissance}} {{units of}} the XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Mura at Letenye and Mursko Središće and captured Čakovec. Ustaše propaganda led the bulk of two regiments from the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division Murska to revolt; only two battalions deployed to their allocated positions. In {{the face of this}} German advance, Yugoslav border troops withdrew towards the Drava. The following day, in the areas of the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki on the left flank of the 4th Army, the Germans cleared the territory north of the Drava, and border guard units were withdrawn south of the river. On this day, the 39th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment was transferred to the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division Murska from the Detachment Ormozki, and the 36th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment of the former joined the 27th <b>Infantry</b> Division Savska. The Mura sector was quiet on 9 April. The 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division Murska took the 39th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment under command, but another of its <b>infantry</b> regiments and the border guards in the divisional sector began to disintegrate due to desertions. With the deteriorating situation on the right flank of the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki to withdraw from the Drava to behind the Bednja river to conform to the line being held by the 27th <b>Infantry</b> Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army began {{a process}} of {{downsizing}} its forces. The Army reactivated the 29th <b>Infantry</b> Division and began reorganizing its forces and further consolidating them. As a result, the Army decided to downsize the 26th <b>Infantry</b> Division into a brigade, and put it under the command of the 29th <b>Infantry</b> Division. On 1 September 1993, the division was inactivated, and the 26th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade designated in its place, based in Springfield. The 3rd and 43rd brigades, 26th <b>Infantry</b> Division were inactivated, and the 86th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade was put under the command of the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> Division. On 1 October 1995, the division was formally designated the 26th Brigade, 29th <b>Infantry</b> Division. In 2004, the 26th Brigade transitioned into the 26th (Yankee) <b>Infantry</b> Brigade Combat Team.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the 199th and 200th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade {{headquarters}} were disbanded, and {{the division}} {{was placed in}} command of the 397th, 398th, and 399th <b>Infantry</b> Regiments directly; the 400th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment was inactivated.|$|E

[...] This would indicate that both Germany and Austria-Hungary had vastly more forces. However, in actuality, in 1914, Russia had 5,971,000 soldiers, Germany had 4,500,000, and Austria-Hungary had 3,000,000. [...] In the game, if the respective sides were allocated proportional numbers of soldiers as to real life, Russia would be at a disadvantage against the Central Powers and ruin {{the balance of the}} game for the two sides. The game had to be playable and fun, and as a result was made to be more balanced that the situation was in history.|$|R

5|$|In 1963, the {{division}} was reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan. Its regimental commands were inactivated {{in favor of}} brigades. The 101st <b>Infantry</b> Regiment became the 1st Brigade, 26th <b>Infantry</b> Division, headquartered in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The 104th <b>Infantry</b> Regiment became the 3rd Brigade, 26th <b>Infantry</b> Division, headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The division was organized as a light <b>infantry</b> division, {{and at the same}} time, the 26th Aviation Battalion was established to provide air support. In 1967 the 43rd <b>Infantry</b> Division of the Connecticut Army National Guard was consolidated into the 43rd Brigade, 26th Division, and put under the command of the 26th <b>Infantry</b> Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the US Army Area Handbook {{described}} the National Guard as 3,000 strong with a headquarters company, the Executive Mansion Guard Battalion in Monrovia, three <b>infantry</b> battalions and one engineer battalion (which was newly formed at Camp Naama in 1962 and {{only had one}} company organized). The three <b>infantry</b> battalions were the 1st <b>Infantry</b> Battalion, at Camp Schiefflin, situated on the airport road between Monrovia and Roberts International Airport, the 2nd <b>Infantry</b> Battalion, HQ at Barclay Training Center (BTC), Monrovia, and the 3rd <b>Infantry</b> Battalion, HQ at Baworobo, Maryland County.|$|E
5|$|In January 1963, the 24th was reorganized as a {{mechanized}} <b>infantry</b> division {{under the}} Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) TO, which replaced the pentomic battle groups with conventional-sized battalions organized in three combined arms brigades. The 169th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, previously {{assigned to the}} 85th <b>Infantry</b> Division was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division. The 85th Division's 170th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade was redesignated the 2nd Brigade, 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division. The 190th <b>Infantry</b> Brigade, previously assigned to the 95th <b>Infantry</b> Division, became the 3rd Brigade, 24th <b>Infantry</b> Division.
