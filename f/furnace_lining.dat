5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern {{incinerators}} operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra <b>furnace</b> <b>line</b> and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.|$|R
5000|$|Ferrosilicon is {{produced}} by reduction of silica or sand with coke {{in the presence of}} iron. Typical sources of iron are scrap iron, millscale. Ferrosilicons with silicon content up to about 15% are made in blast <b>furnaces</b> <b>lined</b> with acid fire bricks. Ferrosilicons with higher silicon content are made in electric arc furnaces. The usual formulations on the market are ferrosilicons with 15%, 45%, 75%, and 90% silicon. The remainder is iron, with about 2% consisting of other elements like aluminium and calcium. An overabundance of silica is used to prevent formation of silicon carbide. Microsilica is a useful byproduct.There are quite a few manufacturers mainly in Andhra Pradesh namely Kalpataru Global Alloys Pvt Ltd and in Bhutan, Meghalaya, etc ...|$|R

50|$|Artificially {{it is also}} an old process, {{having been}} known and studied for 100 years or more, but never brought to {{significant}} industrial application. Lottermoser, a German, wrote a paper on 'das Ausfrieren von Hydrosolen' (the Freezing of Hydrosols) in 1908. Through the 20th century various people have patented techniques using freeze-gelation, most being centred on the use of ceramics as refractory materials. A <b>furnace</b> <b>lining</b> brick, or an investment casting mold, can be easily fabricated using this method.|$|E
50|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{aluminium}} (Al) {{are present in}} many ores including iron ore, sand and some limestones. The former can be removed by washing the ore prior to smelting. Until the introduction of brick lined furnaces, the amount of aluminum contamination was small enough {{that it did not}} have an effect on either the iron or slag. However, when brick began to be used for hearths and the interior of blast furnaces, the amount of aluminium contamination increased dramatically. This was due to the erosion of the <b>furnace</b> <b>lining</b> by the liquid slag.|$|E
40|$|In 2002 the {{commissioning}} of an ilmenite smelter on the North Coast of South Africa {{was extended}} by three months {{due to the}} failure and subsequent replacement of the magnesia-based refractory lining. The lining failed due to the hydration of magnesia caused by an unexpected source of water.

As magnesia-based refractories are used extensively in both ferrous and non-ferrous applications, {{the authors of the}} paper want to share the experience gained from this incident with others. The paper reviews the literature available on furnace start-up practices and explains the hydration of magnesia using available sources.

50|$|Titanium rich {{scaffold}} {{formation is}} a technical measure {{used in the}} blast furnace {{in order to protect}} the refractory <b>furnace</b> <b>lining</b> material from erosion by depositing a protection layer over it.

The operation is conducted by inserting Ti ore either by injecting it through one or more tuyeres (one of 20 or more pipe openings introducing hot gas into the furnace) as a powder, or by adding it to the ore together with coke and iron ore from the furnace top.|$|E

Coarse grained stone was used for <b>furnace</b> <b>lining</b> and from these were hewn the stone boxes used in the Cementation process of steelmaking.

5000|$|... 60% of the KM2 <b>{{furnaces}}</b> were <b>lined</b> with termite earth, {{but only}} one of the KM3 furnaces had traces of an artificial liner. It is uncertain if furnace liners were not as common at KM3 or if they had been removed from furnaces. The earth of a termite mound is more refractory than normal soil because termites select quartz sand grains from the subsoil to build their mounds. Termite mound soil is used as insulation, and employed for its resistance to fusion with slag.|$|R
50|$|The primary chamber {{contains}} the body - {{one at a}} time usually contained in some type of combustible casket or container.

Beneath this layer was a loose reddish deposit with few archaeological finds, some 10-20 cm in thickness, which was a fill of a burial pit. A male skeleton in the pit was recorded lying on its back, its head pointed in the west direction and its feet pointed east. The head was turned right, looking south, with its arms at its side and its legs having been draped across a rock. Many of the bones, including the hands and feet, were missing. Besides the skeletons found in pits, various single burials were discovered in shallow graves. The burial positions of these individual burials differed from those observed in the pits. The head was rested in the western direction, the feet were pointed east, and the feet were in a slight flexed position. All of the skeletons discovered were those of adults or sub-adults, {{some of which were}} missing their lower incisor. Poorly preserved bones of two to three human infants were also recovered. Grave goods within the individual burials included iron and copper bracelets, along with iron beads.|$|E
