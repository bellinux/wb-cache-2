5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several species have only three toes.

5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E

5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until {{the emergence of the}} single-toed Equus.|$|E
5|$|The mountain's first {{recorded}} climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs, {{and a number}} of archeological sites, were found on the mountain and at its <b>feet.</b> <b>With</b> an archeological site at the summit region, Llullaillaco is the highest archeological site in the world. There, in 1999, the mummified remains of three children, known as the Children of Llullaillaco, were found. They are presumed to have been human sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E

5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large hands and <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> extended pads on the digits, {{as well as}} claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
