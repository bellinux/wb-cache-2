However, in 1932–36, Stein explored Persia. In 1933–36, he participated in anthropological expeditions in Southeast Asia and the Himalayas, where he collected data about Shina-language speaking peoples of northwestern Himalayas. In 1935, Poška {{with a team of}} young scholars from the Indian Museum went for a three-month expedition to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands led by the Australian scholar Dr. M. E. Smith. They traveled to various parts of the archipelago and studied the local aboriginal tribes.

These norms, reflected in religious dogmas, traditions, humane letters, social <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> <b>custom,</b> <b>and</b> prescriptive institutions, create the sources of the true community that is the final end of politics.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose the useful {{theories}} for designing and evaluating the space of gardens. The concept of degree of openness for an element of space, the system of partition between one element and the other element, and edge of each element or space were defined and discussed. Each definition is following: degree of openness=(length of fittings such as sliding doors) /(perimeter length of building) Edge is the border between one physical element of space and the other physical element of space. The system of partition was defined by its material and stratum. Applicability and validity of the theory provided by these definitions to actual and concrete spaces were examined. The conclusion is following: 1. Degree of openness is related to the type and use of neighboring building. Which direction a garden was situated relates to degree of openness. 2. A personal <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> <b>custom</b> have an effect on partition system. The <b>habit</b> <b>and</b> <b>custom</b> should be forgotten to make garden spaces more interesting. 3. The person walking in a garden sometimes skips or avoids the edges...|$|R

60|$|The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day. It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to overstate its importance.
