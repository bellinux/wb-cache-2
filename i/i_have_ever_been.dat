5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
500|$|The Porto manager, José Mourinho, led {{his team}} to the Champions League title the {{following}} year before moving to Chelsea. Reflecting on the final, Mourinho was happy to admit he played part of a historic moment in football. He said, [...] "As a football game, Celtic-Porto in Seville was the most exciting football game <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> involved in. An unbelievable game. Every time I see Martin O'Neill I remember I was the lucky one that day. An incredible match. I've never seen such emotional people. It was unbelievable." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took off}} my hat and bowed. It {{was the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> {{addressed}} civilly by any English consular authority.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{understood}} that I {{was now a}} god and the greatest of gods, though at that moment within myself I felt more of a fool than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> done, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in the Highlands," [...] he said. [...] "As it is, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had no {{opportunities}} {{of giving the}} subject any serious consideration." ...|$|R
500|$|Drummer John Stanier has {{described}} the band as [...] "the absolute simplest, most professional ensemble <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> involved with, by far". The band planned to meet and rehearse for a week before recording the album, but upon getting together again, Patton experienced {{a death in the}} family which resulted in him leaving for several days. The band eventually reconvened to rehearse for what Stanier recalls as [...] "a day and a half". Denison felt positively about the process of recording in Nashville, finding that the cheaper studio costs meant he could allow his compositions to [...] "gestate" [...] for longer during his writing process.|$|E
500|$|Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible. Victoria despaired of her husband's lack {{of affection}} towards her, while Ernst devoted {{much of his}} {{attention}} to their daughter, whom he adored. Elisabeth, who physically resembled her mother, preferred the company of her father to Victoria. Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends. Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty [...] "was old and out." [...] Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished. Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals {{as well as those}} who enjoyed fun and frolic. Victoria's cousin Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark remembered one stay there as [...] "the jolliest, merriest house party to which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Atlanta, King {{attended}} Booker T. Washington High School. He {{became known}} for his public speaking ability and {{was part of the}} school's debate team. King became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal in 1942 when he was 13. During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia. Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he was [...] "the angriest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in my life." [...] A precocious student, he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is as {{it should}} be, sir," [...] I replied, forgetting that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> weak-kneed or lukewarm in the cause. [...] "For mother's sake you {{should be the one}} to go home, if both cannot." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{just been}} {{released}} from one hundred hours, and I <b>was</b> weaker than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> before. So weak was I that though my whole body was one mass of bruise and misery, nevertheless I scarcely was aware that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a body.|$|R
60|$|I hastily {{reviewed}} my past. There {{was only}} one place to locate Cecil Fenwick. The only time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> {{far enough away from}} Avonlea in my life was when I was eighteen and had gone to visit an aunt in New Brunswick.|$|R
500|$|Ferber was {{at first}} shocked that {{anyone would want to}} adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern {{that he did not want}} to adapt it as the typical {{frivolous}} [...] "girlie" [...] show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work. Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, [...] "This is the best musical comedy <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life..."Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, [...] "I have a 'bad list,' I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
6000|$|... "So I rose, {{and felt}} even then that I {{who thought that}} every bone in my body must be broken, <b>was</b> {{stronger}} than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> before. It was as though the lamp which had burnt low was filled suddenly with a new and purer oil.|$|R
60|$|Strange {{to say the}} {{audience}} gave them very heartily indeed. I thanked them with tears in my eyes, saying that I was glad {{to leave the room}} as poor as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been,</b> but with a reputation which my conscience as well as their kindness assured me was quite unblemished.|$|R
5000|$|Booth stated, [...] "I was {{standing}} next to Marie-Ève on the Olympic podium and I <b>was</b> the giddiest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> We were laughing about everything...Just being in Wembley in front of 60,000 people....After we got our medals (and bouquets), Marie-Ève said, 'I know these are just flowers but they're so beautiful.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{upcoming}} episode, Yvette said, “HMP Shrewsbury {{is one of the}} scariest places <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> to, and to go back there for this uncut and as-live Most Haunted Halloween special fills me with absolute dread, fear and excitement. I don’t want to do it but can’t wait to do it all at the same time… I just hope the crow bar is safely locked away.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The ancient Greek {{historian}} Manetho probably called Hudjefa I [...] "Sésôchris" [...] {{and reported}} that this king's body had a measurement of [...] "five cubits in its height and three hands in its breadth". Egyptologists doubt {{the basis of this}} observation as no burial site for Hudjefa <b>I</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> found.|$|R
6000|$|At last, when I {{began to}} fancy that I was spirally {{climbing}} the Tower of Babel in a dream, I {{was brought to}} fact by alarming noises, stoppage, and the driver saying that [...] "it couldn't be done." [...] I {{got out of the}} car and suddenly forgot that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in it.|$|R
60|$|The day I {{contrived}} to {{see them}} I was dressed up in a Quaker's habit, and looked so like a Quaker, {{that it was impossible}} for them, who had never seen me before, to suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> anything else; also my way of talking was suitable enough to it, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned that long before.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 February 2011, her {{concerts in}} Circo Voador, Rio de Janeiro and in HSBC Hall, São Paulo {{were the first}} contact with her Brazilian fans. It was so intense that Nash has said on stage [...] "Here (Rio de Janeiro) was the happiest place <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> You are beautiful, incredible" [...] and promised a return soon. On her Twitter, she finally {{declared}} [...] "Rio, you're just {{too good to be}} true. I must be dreaming. Thanks for giving me the best concert of my life".|$|E
2500|$|His {{former coach}} Dan Reeves said about Gradishar, [...] "He {{was as good}} a linebacker as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> around, and I have been around some great ones. He was a leader without {{question}} of our defense while I was with Denver. He was an exceptional football player. I {{had a great deal}} of respect for him when I was at Dallas before I ever went to Denver. After I arrived in Denver and saw what kind of a leader he was my respect for him grew. He never missed a game and was a dominant force on the field. The opposing team always had to take him into account when they devised their game plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|At least 50,000 people {{watched the}} seven yachts leave Galway on Leg 8 of the race. Irish President Mary McAleese made a public speech before the sailors took off, noting their “extraordinary skill and resilience” which had “inspired all of us”. Liu Biwei, China's {{ambassador}} to Ireland, spoke {{of how he}} favoured the Irish-Chinese pairing, and the fleet received several blessings. The sailors reported of the enjoyment they had in Galway, with Puma skipper Ken Read describing it as [...] "the best stopover <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> involved with" [...] saying he would return the following year after enjoying his time {{on the golf course}} and declaring that there was [...] "something about Ireland and myself that seem to like each other".|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} {{travelling}} down hill all this time, {{but at this}} point we crossed a road and the ground began to rise. I was in that painful condition which occurs when one has lost one's first wind and has not yet got one's second. I <b>was</b> hotter than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> in my life.|$|R
60|$|There {{she stood}} as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left her, but now {{her eyes were}} fixed upon the ground and her face once more was {{brooding}} absently as though no such a man as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> It came into my mind that already she had forgotten me, the plaything of an hour, who had served her turn and been cast aside.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the hardest}} {{question}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> called upon to answer; doubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine, forcing a truthful answer by their own truth. He seemed a little startled at first, pondered over the fateful fact a moment, then shook his head, with {{a glance at the}} broad chest and muscular limbs stretched out before him: ...|$|R
2500|$|Foot left to work, part-time, on the Mandrake {{column on}} The Sunday Telegraph. He had {{previously}} contributed articles to Private Eye since 1964 but decided, in February 1967, {{to take a}} cut in salary and join {{the staff of the}} magazine on a full-time basis, working with its editor, Richard Ingrams and Peter Cook, by now in possession of a controlling interest in the magazine. When asked about the decision later, Foot would say he could not resist the prospect of two whole pages with complete freedom to write whatever he liked. [...] "Writing for Private Eye is the only journalism <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> engaged in which is pure enjoyment. It is free publishing of the most exhilarating kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several of Holt's friends {{confronted him}} {{about the dangers of}} his hobby, {{including}} his press secretary, Tony Eggleton, to whom he responded [...] "look Tony, what are the odds of a prime minister being drowned or taken by a shark?". On 20 May 1967, Holt had a close call while diving at Cheviot Beach on the Mornington Peninsula, where he became distressed and called for help. Pulled ashore by his diving companions, he remained conscious but turned purple and vomited a large amount of seawater. Holt attributed the incident to a leaking snorkel, and supposedly remarked [...] "that's the closest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> to drowning in my life!". A few months later, on 5 August, he was spearfishing at Dunk Island on the Great Barrier Reef. He spent 25 minutes chasing a large coral trout, but eventually had to abandon the pursuit due to extreme shortness of breath.|$|E
2500|$|In 1819, Randolph {{provided}} {{in his will}} for the manumission of his slaves after his death. He wrote, [...] "I give and bequeath to all my slaves their freedom, heartily regretting that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> the owner of one." [...] Three years later, in 1822, in a codicil to that will, he stipulated that money be provided to transport and settle the freed slaves on land to be purchased {{in the free state}} of Ohio. Each slave above the age of 40 was to receive 10 acres of land. He provided for the manumission of hundreds of slaves in his will. Although the will was challenged in the courts, his slaves were finally ruled to be free. After a lengthy court case, his will was upheld. In 1846, three hundred and eighty-three former [...] "Randolph Slaves" [...] arrived in Cincinnati, before settling in Rumley, Shelby County, Ohio. Many of them ultimately settled at Rossville near Piqua, Ohio, of which only the community cemetery remains.|$|E
60|$|I was so {{faint and}} weary that I closed with this offer; {{and taking the}} money out of his claw, not without trembling, went away more hungry and thirsty than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been,</b> a little before sunset. But at an expense of threepence I soon {{refreshed}} myself completely; and, being in better spirits then, limped seven miles upon my road.|$|R
60|$|She {{called for}} a looking-glass, and made one of her women touch up her dress and bring her a fan, asking whether <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> presented. No, my first stay in Paris had been too short; besides, my rank {{did not make it}} needful, as my husband was only Viscount by favour of his uncle, who let him hold the estate.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{mere fact}} of being asked my opinion gratified my vanity, and the respectful `sir' {{with which the}} {{question}} concluded caused my heart to beat high with unwonted emotion. It {{was the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> addressed gravely as a man; it was a new sensation, and I think may be regarded as an era in my existence.|$|R
