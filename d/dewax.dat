40|$|The cuticle of land {{plants is}} the first {{physical}} barrier to protect their aerial parts from biotic and abiotic stresses. <b>DEWAX,</b> an AP 2 /ERF-type transcription factor, negatively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis. In this study, we investigated the resistance to Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa overexpressing <b>DEWAX</b> and in Arabidopsis <b>dewax</b> mutant. Compared to wild type (WT) leaves, Arabidopsis <b>DEWAX</b> OX and <b>dewax</b> leaves were more and less permeable to toluidine blue dye, respectively. The ROS levels increased in <b>DEWAX</b> OX leaves, but decreased in <b>dewax</b> relative to WT leaves. Compared to WT, <b>DEWAX</b> OX was more resistant, while <b>dewax</b> was more sensitive to B. cinerea; however, defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 :GFP were inversely modulated. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that the expression of defense-related genes was upregulated in <b>DEWAX</b> OX, but downregulated in <b>dewax</b> relative to WT. Transactivation assay showed that <b>DEWAX</b> upregulated the expression of PDF 1. 2 a, IGMT 1, and PRX 37. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that <b>DEWAX</b> directly interacts with the GCC-box motifs of PDF 1. 2 a promoter. In addition, ectopic expression of <b>DEWAX</b> increased the tolerance to B. cinerea in C. sativa. Taken together, we suggest that increased ROS accumulation and DEWAX-mediated upregulation of defense-related genes are closely associated with enhanced resistance to B. cinerea in Arabidopsis and C. sativa...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerial parts}} of plants are {{protected}} from desiccation and other stress by surface cuticular waxes. The total cuticular wax loads and the expression of wax biosynthetic genes are significantly downregulated in Arabidopsis thaliana under dark conditions. We isolated Decrease Wax Biosynthesis (<b>DEWAX),</b> which encodes an AP 2 /ERF-type transcription factor that is preferentially expressed in the epidermis and induced by darkness. Disruption of <b>DEWAX</b> leads {{to an increase in}} total leaf and stem wax loads, and the excess wax phenotype of <b>dewax</b> was restored to wild type levels in complementation lines. Moreover, overexpression of <b>DEWAX</b> resulted in a reduction in total wax loads in leaves and stems compared with the wild type and altered the ultrastructure of cuticular layers. <b>DEWAX</b> negatively regulates the expression of alkane-forming enzyme, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, ATP citrate lyase A subunit, enoyl-CoA reductase, and fatty acyl-CoA reductase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that <b>DEWAX</b> directly interacts with the promoters of wax biosynthesis genes. Cuticular wax biosynthesis is negatively regulated twice a day by the expression of <b>DEWAX,</b> throughout the night and at stomata closing. Significantly higher levels (10 - to 100 -fold) of <b>DEWAX</b> transcripts were found in leaves than in stems, suggesting that DEWAX-mediated transcriptional repression may be an additional mechanism contributing to the different total wax loads in leaves and stems...|$|E

Flax was found to give the best mechanical properties measured in bending mode and used for all tests. Several methods able to improve adhesion between matrix and flax fibres were studied. A treatment of flax fibres with NaOH-water was found to decrease the mechanical properties of composites. Ethanol or dichloromethane solvents that are known to <b>dewax</b> flax fibre surfaces improve the mechanical properties of final board. The addition of pectin to the lignosulfonate matrix was found to improve the mechanical properties in the same order of magnitude as with the ethanol treatment. Both methods improve the flexural strength by 60 % while keeping the elastic modulus constant. Mechanical improvement shows that these two methods are increasing the lignosulfonate/flax fibre interfacial adhesion.

However, the extraction of DNA by means of the conventional phenol/chloroform method is time consuming and requires the use of potentially dangerous chemical reagents. This paper describes a method based upon the use of magnetic beads for the extraction of M tuberculosis DNA from both routinely formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissues and frozen tissues. Magnetic bead extracted DNA from brain, lymph node, and lung tissues collected from patients with human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis was compared with that extracted using the phenol/chloroform method. The magnetic bead extraction procedure requires less than two hours, including the time necessary to <b>dewax</b> the tissue sections. In all cases, the DNA extracted with both methods was amplified successfully by PCR for the M tuberculosis IS 6110 sequence. Magnetic bead DNA extraction can be used on both frozen and archival tissues: the method is reliable, simple, sensitive, and rapid; in addition, it does not use hazardous procedures or specialised laboratory equipment and can be used for routine DNA isolation from various human tissues...|$|E

The aim was to test and compare the hypothesis that xylene-ethanol free (XEF) sections deparaffinized with diluted DWS are better than or at par with the conventional H and E sections. Materials and Methods: Fifty paraffin-embedded tissue blocks was included. One section was stained with conventional HandE (group A) and the other with XEF HandE (group B) staining method. Slides were scored for parameters: nuclear, cytoplasmic, clarity, uniformity, and crispness of staining. Z test was used for statistical analysis.

We therefore tested whether traditional xylene-based removal of paraffin is required on sections from paraffin-embedded tissue, when HIER is performed by vigorous boiling in 10 mM Tris/ 0. 5 mM EGTA-buffer (pH= 9). Immunohistochemical results using HIER with or without prior <b>dewaxing</b> in xylene were evaluated using 7 primary antibodies targeting proteins located in the cytosol, intracellular vesicles and plasma membrane. No effect of omitting prior <b>dewaxing</b> was observed on staining pattern. Semiquantitative analysis did not show HIER to influence the intensity of labelling consistently.

The aim of the research is to study the effects of increasing activated charcoal content on <b>dewaxing</b> time and moulds properties. Ceramic moulds were prepared using modified coarse back-up stucco that was applied to the layers 3 - 6 only. The modified stucco was prepared by mixing with 0 - 30 % activated charcoal. The moulds were <b>dewaxed</b> in microwave <b>dewaxing</b> test rig and then fired. During <b>dewaxing,</b> it was found that moulds with 30 % activated charcoal usually crack on their edges. The green and fired moulds were tested for density, porosity and strength. Weibull analysis was conducted on the strength data for moulds with 0 % and 25 % activated the charcoal content. The <b>dewaxing</b> time reduced by about 37. 5 %, density and flexural strength of the both green and fired samples decreased for 25 % increase in activated charcoal content. Whereas the porosity increase in both samples for the corresponding increase in activated charcoal content. The Weibull analysis shows a narrower strength distribution at 25 % activated charcoal content. Lastly, the findings of this research show that increasing activated charcoal content in the moulds improves microwave absorption and decrease <b>dewaxing</b> time with no preheating required.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{literature}} review of use of biodiesel fuel for compression ignition engines. This study {{is based on the}} reports of about 50 scientists including (some manufacturers and agencies) who published their results between 1900 and 2005. The scientists and researchers conducted the test, using different types of raw and refined oils. These experiments with raw biodiesel as fuel did not show the satisfactory results, when they used the raw biodiesel. The fuel showed injector coking and piston ring sticking. Some of the scientists mixed with methanol or ethanol in presence of KOH or NaOH and then filtered and washed. The process is called transeterfication and is used to degum, <b>dewax</b> and to remove triglycerides from the vegetable oils. Transeterfication decreases the viscosity, density and flash point of the fuel. The results obtained, by using such oils in compression ignition engines as fuel, were satisfactory only for short term. A vast majority of scientists mixed the transesterified biodiesel oil with diesel with different ratios. When tested in long run, blends of the oil above 20 % (B 20) caused maintenance problems and even sometimes damaged the engine. Some authors reported success in using vegetable oils as diesel fuel extenders in blends of more than 20 % even in long-term studies. The main conclusion derived by the researchers is that coking is a potentially serious problem with the use of unmodified vegetable biodiesel. However, the refined, chemically processed and degumed vegetable oil mixed with diesel can be used to run compression ignition engine for longer duration. It was reported that there was a slight decrease in brake power and a slight increase in fuel consumption. However, the lubricant properties of the biodiesel are better than diesel, which can help to increase the engine life. Moreover, the biodiesel fuel is environment friendly, produces much less NOx and HC and absolutely no Sox and no increase in CO 2 at global level.

These sequences flank the centromeres and can present a target measured in megabases. In this protocol a biotin or digoxigenin labelled DNA probe is detected using HRP-conjugated antibodies. The signal is visualised with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Normal, healthy nuclei show two spots. Aneusomic nuclei show 1, 3, 4 or more spots. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A 6 mm section of a paraffin embedded raft culture hybridised to a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite probe. We buy our probes from Appligene/Oncor although they are very expensive and the telesales staff are rude. ### Starting material We have two types of starting material; (i) tissue culture cells attached to glass slides, (ii) sections taken from paraffin embedded tissue. 1. Tissue culture cells. We use multispot slides with 4 wells separated by PTFE coating. The slides are treated with APES prior to use (see below). The cells are trypsinised and resuspended as usual then one or two drops are placed onto the end well of a labelled slide. The cells are allowed to attach overnight in a humid chamber in the CO 2 incubator. Next day the slides are immersed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. After 2 days fixation the slides are rinsed in H 2 O and allowed to air dry. Store dry, dust-free. - Paraffin sections. Take 6 mm sections onto APES treated slides (see below) and bake overnight at 60 C. <b>Dewax</b> in Xylene, 2 x 5 minutes. Then immerse as follows; 100 % ethanol 2 x 5 minutes, 90 % Ethanol 5 minutes, 75 % ethanol 5 minutes, H 2 O 2 x 5 minutes and allow to dry. Store dry, dust-free. ### Typical Protocol 1. Immerse the slides in 1 M sodium thiocyanate at 80 C for 10 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O and allow to dry. - *This treatment strips away the histones*. - *If using cheap glass coplin jars, allow to heat up slowly with the water bath, otherwise they crack*. - Treat the slides with 4 mg/ml pepsin at 37 C for 30 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O, 2 x 5 minutes, and allow to dry. - *This opens up the fixed (crosslinked) cytoplasm to allow probe access. Make up 0. 2 M HCl [50 mls H 2 O + 800 ml conc. HCl], weigh out a little pepsin (Sigma P 7012) into a universal and add the 0. 2 M HCl to make 4 mg/ml. Place the slides flat in a humid chamber (eg a large square plastic petri dish) and drop the pepsin gently onto the slide. Then place in the 37 C incubator*. - *This pepsin digestion is the most crucial step. Too little digestion and the probe {{will not be able}} to access the chromosomes. Too much and the morphology will all be chewed up*. - Prepare the hybridisation solution. - *One well of a multispot slide needs 6 ml of hyb with a 13 mm circular coverslip*. - *A square 22 mm coverslip uses 10 - 12 ml*. - *For larger than this you can put two slides face to face (acting as each other's coverslip) with 30 ml of hyb solution*. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 4. Apply an appropriate amount of hybridisation solution onto the slide and cover with a coverslip. 5. Incubate at 80 C for 10 minutes. This denatures the DNA 6. Transfer to a humid chamber and incubate overnight at 37 C 7. Dip the slides into a coplin jar containing wash solution, allow the coverslips to slide off. Immerse the slides in formamide wash solution for 20 minutes at 42 C. - *We wash in formamide wash solution at 42 C. The wash can be done without formamide at higher temperature (try 0. 25 x SSC at 72 C for 5 minutes) Formamide wash solution: 60 ml formamide TOXIC (Sigma F 7503), 30 ml H 2 O, 10 ml 20 x SSC, 80 ml conc. HCl (to bring the pH to 7) * - *Do not allow the slides to dry at any stage until after DAB detection*. 8. Immerse briefly in PBS to wash, then incubate with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room temperature. - *Lay the slides flat in a humid chamber and drop the solution onto them* - *Do not allow the slides to dry* - *Blocking solution: 100 ml PBS, 2 g BSA (Sigma A 3059), 50 ml Tween 20 *. - *I carefully dry around the tissue (or round the edge of the slide if I cannot see the tissue) with a paper towel to define a wet area for the various washes*. 9. Drain off the blocking solution and replace with mouse anti-biotin antibody diluted 1 : 100 in blocking solution for 40 minutes at 37 C. - *We currently use DAKO antibody #M 0743, 100 - 200 ml per slide*. 10. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 11. Incubate with rabbit anti-mouse HRP antibody diluted 1 : 80 for 40 minutes at 37 C - We use DAKO P 0260 12. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 13. Incubate with swine anti-rabbit HRP antibody diluted 1 : 100 for 40 minutes at 37 C - *We use DAKO P 0217 * 14. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes 15. Detect the signal using Diaminobenzidine (DAB) - *I use DAB tablets (Sigma D 4293) to make 5 ml of DAB solution and then carefuuly drop the DAB onto the slides. DAB is carcinogenic so take care. The signal takes about 10 minutes to develop. If you're lucky you may be able to see tiny spots at low power under the microscope (take care not to dip the lens in the DAB solution) * - *Follow these URLs to learn about safe disposal of DAB:* [[URL] [[URL] 16. Rinse in tap water, stain the nuclei using haematoxylin, de-hydrate through the ethanol series and mount in DPX. - *The length of the haematoxylin stain depends on the kind of haemaotoxylin and how much it has been used. Try 30 secs at first. Check under the low power microscope*. **APES treatment of slides** *This is an alternative to poly-L-lysine treatment. The APES coating makes the slides more adhesive for fixed tissue and living cells*. Fill several big metal slide racks with slides (I do hundreds at a time), then treat each rack sequentially as follows; 1.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the green density on the <b>dewaxing</b> {{behaviour}} of two different uniaxially pressed iron based powder metallurgy alloys has been characterised by means of non-destructive mechanical and microstructural techniques, i. e. impulse excitation technique and synchrotron tomography. The elastic and damping properties of the green and <b>dewaxed</b> specimens pressed to two different densities have been evaluated. It {{was found that the}} as-pressed green specimens with lower density possessed higher stiffness and lower damping than the high density ones. This behaviour has been explained on a microstructural basis, considering the damage generated in the green specimens during the ejection step. The elastic and damping properties of the specimens after <b>dewaxing</b> strongly depended on their initial green density. Increased elastic properties (and lower damping) were observed for the low density specimens with respect to their green counterparts, while the opposite behaviour was observed for the specimens with higher green density (i. e. decreased stiffness and slightly higher damping after <b>dewaxing).</b> "In situ" monitoring of the evolution of the elastic and damping properties of the materials has been carried out by means of the high temperature impulse excitation technique to better understand the behaviour observed. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis has been carried out to correlate the mass loss events with the relevant features of the HT-IET curves. It was demonstrated that the damage generated in the green specimens during ejection is amplified during <b>dewaxing</b> for the high density compacts, while some degree of pre-sintering is responsible for the increased properties of the lower density specimens.

40|$|International audienceRaman {{spectroscopy}} is a non-destructive, non-invasive, {{rapid and}} economical technique {{which has the}} potential to be an excellent method for the diagnosis of cancer and understanding disease progression through retrospective studies of archived tissue samples. Historically, biobanks are generally comprised of formalin fixed paraffin preserved tissue and as a result these specimens are often used in spectroscopic research. Tissue in this state has to be <b>dewaxed</b> prior to Raman analysis to reduce paraffin contributions in the spectra. However, although the procedures are derived from histopathological clinical practice, the efficacy of the <b>dewaxing</b> procedures that are currently employed is questionable. Ineffective removal of paraffin results in corruption of the spectra and previous experiments have shown that the efficacy can depend on the <b>dewaxing</b> medium and processing time. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of commonly used spectroscopic substrates (CaF 2, Spectrosil quartz and low-E slides) and the influence of different histological tissue types (normal, cancerous and metastatic) on tissue preparation and to assess their use for spectral histopathology. Results show that CaF 2 followed by Spectrosil contribute the least to the spectral background. However, both substrates retain paraffin after <b>dewaxing.</b> Low-E substrates, which exhibit the most intense spectral background, do not retain wax and resulting spectra are not affected by paraffin peaks. We also show a disparity in paraffin retention depending upon the histological identity of the tissue with abnormal tissue retaining more paraffin than normal...|$|R

The error of hydrocarbon contents calculation via the use of the developed model does not exceed 1. 6 wt. %. This makes it possible to apply the model for solution to optimization and forecasting problems occurred in catalytic systems under industrial conditions. It was shown through the model calculation that temperature in the <b>dewaxing</b> reactor without catalyst deactivation is lower by 19 °C than actual and catalyst deactivation degree accounts for 32 %...|$|R
