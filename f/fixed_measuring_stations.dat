40|$|The {{stochastic}} Lagrange wave {{model is}} a realistic alternative to the Gaussian linear wave model, which has been successfully used in ocean engineering {{for more than half}} a century. This paper presents the slope distributions and other characteristic distributions at level crossings for asymmetric Lagrange time waves, i. e. what can be observed at a <b>fixed</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>station,</b> thereby extending results previously given for space waves. The distributions are given as expectations in a multivariate normal distribution, and they have to be evaluated by simulation or numerical integration. Interesting characteristic variables are: slope in time, slope in space, and vertical particle velocity when the waves are observed close to instances when the water level crosses a predetermined level. The theory has been made possible by recent generalizations of Rice's formula for the expected number of marked crossings in random fields...|$|R
40|$|In the {{stochastic}} Lagrange {{model for}} ocean waves the {{vertical and horizontal}} location of surface water particles are modeled as correlated Gaussian processes. In this article we investigate the statistical properties of wave characteristics related to wave asymmetry in the 3 D Lagrange model. We present a modification of the original Lagrange model that can produce front-back asymmetry both of the space waves, i. e. observation of the sea surface at a fixed time, and of the time waves, observed at a <b>fixed</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>station.</b> The results, {{which are based on}} a multivariate form of Rice's formula for the expected number of level crossings, are given {{in the form of the}} cumulative distribution functions for the slopes observed either by asynchronous sampling in space, or at synchronous sampling at upcrossings and down-crossings, respectively, of a specified fixed level. The theory is illustrated in a numerical section, showing how the degree of wave asymmetry depends on the directional spectral spreading and on the mean wave direction. It is seen that the asymmetry is more accentuated for high waves, a fact that may be of importance in safety analysis of capsizing risk...|$|R

30|$|It {{was found}} that the fixed-point {{traverse}} measurement at the airflow <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> from A 8 –A 12 sometimes received “questionable” readings because of flow reversal and pulsing. In the context of the mine-wide airflow distribution, these airflow <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> were located in the lowest airflow zones and were eliminated from further exploration and analysis to avoid ambiguity. In addition, the two moving traverse readings at airflow <b>measuring</b> <b>station</b> A 14 were removed due to significant deviations. Therefore, the readings {{from the rest of the}} 21 measuring locations, including the moving traverse, the fixed-point traverse, and the centerline velocity, are processed and analyzed in this paper.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the equivalent-linear model for seismic wave propagation, a {{comparison}} between the actual and computed ground shaking of a nearby <b>measuring</b> <b>station</b> is conducted. A complete analysis involving backward propagation of shear waves to obtain the bedrock acceleration at a <b>measuring</b> <b>station</b> site is carried out, and thereafter a forward propagation is calculated to obtain the computed ground shaking at another <b>measuring</b> <b>station</b> site based on the latter’s soil profile. Under ideal situations, the computed ground shaking should be identical to the actual recorded shaking at the latter’s station. But as the equivalent-linear method is a simplified approach, some differences are expected.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} for an airport noise monitoring system is presented that comprises {{not only a}} number of <b>measuring</b> <b>stations,</b> but also a dedicated sound propagation model and an aircraft noise emission model. This approach enables estimation of noise levels in the whole area around the airport and {{not only at the}} location of the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations.</b> An additional advantage is that the locations of the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> can be chosen more freely. Traditionally the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> must be located near residential areas where the influence of other noise sources (such as cars or wind) cannot be eliminated. Better locations can be found that yield more reliable data and therefore more reliable noise levels. To update the sound propagation model frequently, the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> not only <b>measure</b> noise levels, but also other parameters, like temperature and wind profile. The sound emission of the aircraft is derived from measurement results, complemented with a directional aircraft noise emission model. A tool was developed to visualize the power of combining data and models in this model-based monitoring system. The use of models opens possibilities for interesting applications such as i) short term noise forecasts, ii) scenario studies with various aircraft distributions and iii) enforcement of noise limits...|$|R
