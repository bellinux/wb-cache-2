5|$|By 1806, the French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois {{departed for}} the Atlantic Ocean and a British expeditionary force captured the Cape of Good Hope. Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, {{commander of the}} British Royal Navy in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean at Madras in British India in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean was now able to concentrate on {{a major threat to}} British shipping in the region; the Dutch squadron based in the Dutch East Indies, specifically on Java at the port of Batavia.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire has {{two primary}} bike paths that cover a large {{expanse of the}} village. One runs in a north-south {{direction}} alongside Riverwoods Road in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, while the other runs in an east-west direction from the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, across the Des Plaines River, and to the village hall in {{the west side of}} the village. Smaller bike paths connect individual neighborhood areas within and around Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{watershed}} is {{more open}} and rural than the urban western half, which consists largely of residential areas with pockets of commerce and industry. An estimated 180,000people lived in the watershed as of 2012.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the holiday}} homes were never {{designed}} for long-term residence and {{are now in a}} state of disrepair. According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village is the most deprived area of England. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta. Most of the route passes through desolate, remote areas. Through the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state the route is concurrent with Interstate 70 (I-70). US-50 both enters and exits Utah concurrent with US-6, however the two routes are separate through {{the center of}} the state.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|Headquarters 4th Parachute Brigade {{began to}} {{function}} again {{and a small}} number of stragglers from the parachute battalions were reunited with their units.

In descending order from north to south were the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, 156 Para, 'D' Squadron GPR, 10 Para at the Oosterbeek crossroads, 'C' Squadron GPR, 21st Independent Parachute Company, the RASC Detachment and finally Lonsdale Force.|$|E
5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, {{the formation of}} a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{conference was}} cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximinus {{had crossed the}} Bosporus and invaded European territory. Licinius {{departed}} and eventually defeated Maximinus, gaining control over the entire <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt {{at the hands of}} a character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar; Licinius, for his part, had Constantine's statues in Emona destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{route from}} 34Street to Anthony Henday Drive is {{designated}} as Highway100 by Alberta Transportation, {{but is not}} signed as such at any point along the route.

5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's dÃ©tente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also}} a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of conquest, polities in the {{northern}} YucatÃ¡n peninsula included Mani, Cehpech and Chakan; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal all bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah {{was also in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. Tases, Hocaba and Sotuta were all landlocked provinces. Chanputun (modern ChampotÃ³n) was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as was Acalan. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the PetÃ©n Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory between the PetÃ©n lakes and what is now Campeche. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not {{to be confused with the}} modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern PetÃ©n. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially {{as shown by}} a wide range {{in the degree of}} vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pÄhoehoe and Ê»aÊ»Ä, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown {{was announced in}} 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the JetsâRaiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
