Mulder and Smith flee with both Scully and the Bounty Hunter in pursuit, eventually reaching a waterfront. Mulder sneaks {{up on the}} Bounty Hunter and stabs him in the neck with the alien stiletto. Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead Bounty Hunter. When she approaches the body, the Bounty Hunter wakes up and chokes her, demanding to know where Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

5|$|Players have {{discovered}} that {{the cover of the}} North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a watermark from IGN, and traced the source to an image taken from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> error.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|The victory gave Auburn fans {{hope that}} if Oklahoma won the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, a split {{national}} championship would result. By contract, {{the winner of the}} BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach. USC's blowout 55–19 victory over Oklahoma, however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place. When the final college football polls of the season were released, USC was voted number one by a large margin, though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first. More than three years after the game, ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second on his list of victims of the BCS system, just behind USC being left out of the championship game in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland {{each have}} their own {{government}} or executive, led by a First Minister (or, {{in the case of}} Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, on matters that only affect England. The McKay Commission reported on this matter in March 2013 recommending that laws affecting only England should need support from a majority of English members of parliament.|$|E
25|$|The main female {{protagonist of}} the story, Sunao, {{is a second}} year {{transfer}} student from class 2-A in high school who tends {{to have a strong}} personality, never being one to willingly back down. In the beginning of the story, her family moves to a new town because of her mother's work as an actress. Ever since seeing her mother acting once when she was younger, Sunao dreams of someday becoming an actress too, and likewise is very passionate about drama in general. On her first day at her new school, she adamantly wants to {{become a member of the}} drama club, though is soon informed that their school <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> club yet established.

500|$|Although the Fourth Amendment {{generally}} prohibits unreasonable {{searches and}} seizures, the Supreme Court of the United States has clarified that searches and seizures are not unreasonable when citizens consent to them. Scholars have traced {{the origins of}} the Consent to Search Doctrine {{as far back as the}} 1920s, but it was not until the 1970s that the Court clarified that searches are reasonable if, under a [...] "totality of the circumstances", the search is [...] "voluntary". Courts generally look to whether officers believed, at the time of the search, the individual being searched provided voluntary consent. Officers may also rely on the consent of someone who reasonably appears to have authority to consent to a police search, even if that person actually <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> authority. However, if officers obtain consent after engaging in an unconstitutional seizure, the consent is considered [...] "tainted" [...] and evidence obtained from such a search cannot be admitted during a subsequent criminal prosecution.|$|E
500|$|Ehsan Ahrari of Asia Times accused some European {{countries}} of double standards in adopting laws that outlaw Holocaust denial but still defended {{the concept of}} freedom of speech in this case. Anti-holocaust or genocide denial laws are in place in Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Israel, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, and Romania in 2005. However, Denmark <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> laws and there wasand still isno EU-wide law against holocaust denial. Randall Hansen said that laws against holocaust denial were not directly comparable with restrictions on social satire, so could not be considered a double standard unless one believed in an absolute right to freedom of speech, and that those who do would doubtless oppose holocaust denial laws. Columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote that there was a double standard in many protesters' demands for religious sensitivity in this case, but not in others. He asked, [...] "Have any of these 'moderates' ever protested the grotesque caricatures of Christians and, most especially, Jews that are broadcast throughout the Middle East on a daily basis?" ...|$|E

500|$|The term dwarf {{planet has}} itself been {{somewhat}} controversial, as {{it implies that}} these bodies are planets, much as dwarf stars are stars. This is the conception of the Solar System that Stern promoted when he coined the phrase. The older word planetoid ("having {{the form of a}} planet") <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> connotation, and is also used by astronomers for bodies that fit the IAU definition. Brown states that planetoid is [...] "a perfectly good word" [...] that has been used for these bodies for years, and that {{the use of the term}} dwarf planet for a non-planet is [...] "dumb", but that it was motivated by an attempt by the IAU division III plenary session to reinstate Pluto as a planet in a second resolution. Indeed, the draft of Resolution 5A had called these median bodies planetoids, but the plenary session voted unanimously to change the name to dwarf planet. The second resolution, 5B, defined dwarf planets as a subtype of planet, as Stern had originally intended, distinguished from the other eight that were to be called [...] "classical planets". Under this arrangement, the twelve planets of the rejected proposal were to be preserved in a distinction between eight classical planets and four dwarf planets. Resolution 5B was defeated in the same session that 5A was passed. Because of the semantic inconsistency of a dwarf planet not being a planet due to the failure of Resolution 5B, alternative terms such as nanoplanet and subplanet were discussed, but there was no consensus among the CSBN to change it.|$|E
