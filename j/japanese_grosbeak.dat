50|$|The {{alternate}} subspecies (E. p. magnostris) {{is completely}} migratory, breeding around the Amur, Ural and Manchurian regions and then wintering down in Hebei and Beijing, uncommonly ranging south towards North Korea. The nominate race occurs in Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu {{and is not}} as seasonally migratory but does wander considerably during winter, largely in pursuit of food sources. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>grosbeak</b> is locally common, occasionally being abundant around prime feeding areas. It occurs in deciduous or mixed forests. More commonly, it is a bird of valleys rather than hillsides. This species also turns up in woods and groves of oak and birch and well-wooded parks and gardens. The species may winter {{on the edge of}} cultivated areas. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>grosbeak</b> usually occurs in pairs or small flocks. Behaviourally, it can be deceptively secretive, often staying hidden in foliage near the tree canopy. However, its location may regularly be betrayed by its voice. Mostly, the grosbeak feeds on variety of seeds and insects. During winter, they mainly live on cedar nuts, but also will feed on birch seeds and berries. During the summer, they become largely insectivorous and regularly eat caterpillars and beetles.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a large}} finch, with a {{reported}} weight of 80 g (for a single male) and a length of 18 to 23 cm. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 10.2 to 11.7 cm, the tail is 8.3 to 9.5 cm and the culmen is 2.1 to 2.6 cm. The signature feature of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>grosbeak</b> is its large, pointed bright yellow bill. The adult grosbeak has a large black marking extending from the nape to the chin and ear-coverts to the neck. The side of the neck is a contrasting pale whitish grey. The bird's underside is a more dull grey. The back is greyish-brown while the flanks are washed with a gingery or tawny-brown colour. The wings and tail are black but for a white patch on the inner-coverts and band of white {{in the middle of}} the primaries, which is visible in flight.
