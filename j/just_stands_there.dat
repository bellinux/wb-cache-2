After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When {{you go to a}} show and see a guitar player who <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E

It is best not to remember using its powers because it uses them while in a deep sleep state.|$|E

50|$|The mind {{must always}} be {{in the state of}} 'flowing,' for when it stops {{anywhere}} that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death. When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. He <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{example of}} chaos {{is the absence}} of gods. When Hidetora sees Lady Sué, a devout Buddhist and the most religious character in the film, he tells her, [...] "Buddha is gone from this miserable world."

[...] Kurosawa has repeated the point, saying [...] "humanity must face life without relying on God or Buddha."

[...] In the 1935 novel Little House on the Prairie by Laura Ingalls Wilder, the character Mr. Edwards sings the song as his trademark; accordingly, the Little House on the Prairie television series from the 1970s and 1980s uses the song as a leitmotif for the character.
