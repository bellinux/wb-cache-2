Jacqui plans to adopt because of her criminal record. Tony discovers he has a secret child called Harry. Jacqui forces Tony to make a choice: Harry or her. Tony chooses Harry and she ends their relationship and leaves. An intoxicated Tony and Mercedes betray Jacqui by sleeping together. Jacqui fails to resist Tony again and they restart their on-off relationship. She then changes her surname back to McQueen from Malota and Mercedes reveals that she is pregnant and Jacqui asks Mercedes to let her and Tony raise the baby, unaware it's Tony's baby but Mercedes has an abortion, infuriating Jacqui so Myra offers to be her surrogate but she refuses. Tina sees <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> her sister is for a child and offers to be the surrogate, leaving Jacqui and Tony ecstatic about having a future child.|$|E
25|$|Legions of Lanciarii, and Mattiarii. The Notitia Dignitatum lists both as legiones palatinae. Some {{claim that}} the Mattiarii may have been allied forces. However, mattiarii may refer to mace-armed {{infantry}} (mattea being Latin for mace). Valens {{is referred to as}} seeking protection with the Lanciarii and Mattiarii as the other Roman forces collapsed (apparently a sign of <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> the battle had become). Eventually they were unable to hold off the Goths.|$|E
25|$|After sentencing, Judge Bordwell {{issued a}} long {{statement}} minimizing {{the role of}} Lincoln Steffens in bringing about the plea deal. Bordwell wrote that the prosecution had long sought a plea deal, but could not agree to J. B.'s insistence that his brother go free. The judge stated that what really broke the deadlock was the arrest of Bert Franklin, a detective hired by the defense, {{on a charge of}} attempted bribery of jurors. The bribery attempt, he wrote, revealed <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> the defense was, and forced them to agree to a prison sentence for J. J.|$|E

In order to protect their Syrian border zone the new Pharaoh Akhenaten instead received envoys from the resurgent powers of the Hittites and Assyria.

25|$|In May 1994, WJBK's then-owner, New World Communications {{signed a}} groupwide deal with Fox to switch the network affiliations of {{twelve of the}} company's 14 {{stations}} to Fox (two of which New World would sell to Fox outright as it could not keep them due to ownership conflicts). One of the stations due to switch was WJBK. CBS approached all of Detroit's major stations--WDIV-TV, WXYZ-TV, WKBD and WXON—but all of them turned CBS down. Fearing it would be left without an affiliate in Detroit, CBS began talks with WADL. As a measure of <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> CBS was at the time, it approached WADL even though most Detroit-area viewers didn't even know the station existed. However, Franklin Adell and CBS could not come to a mutual agreement, due to what CBS called unreasonable demands on Adell's part. CBS eventually bought Detroit's other low-profile independent, WGPR-TV (channel 62), changing its calls to WWJ-TV and moved the network's programming there on December 11, 1994, months before its purchase was finalized.|$|E
2500|$|A {{representative}} from a Right Wing Group, Dan Gainor, condemned the video, {{saying it was}} too steamy for [...] "family-friendly American Idol" [...] and {{went as far as}} saying her [...] "skanky new video shows <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance". E! Online's Natalie Finn commented, [...] "Pitbull gets to keep his suit on, but Lopez, clad for the most part in a bodysuit and fishnets (and at times a solid coat of glitter) is bare for the grabbing. Her fellow ladies in the video... may have even less on—which is perfect since there's a gravity-defying orgy taking place in the background as Lopez and the well-muscled Smart make eyes at each other".|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} of Jennifer Lopez's song, [...] "Dance Again", which aired on the program, was criticized as {{inappropriate}} for younger viewers. Dan Gainor of the Culture and Media Institute wrote, [...] "Even the supposedly family-friendly TV shows like American Idol are never {{safe in the}} hands of Hollywood," [...] and went as far as saying her [...] "skanky new video shows <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance. Such sexualized videos aren't appropriate for any children to watch, including Lopez's own twins." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy also commented about the video's content not being appropriate for a family show, [...] "we thought [...] "Idol" [...] was a family show? This video is less [...] "sit on the couch and chill with dad" [...] and more [...] "call your boyfriend over immediately." [...] Ed Masley from AZ central.com said that the video {{was on the verge of}} being too [...] "steamy" [...] for the show.|$|E

60|$|You {{perceive}} {{that he is}} a pleasant text for me. It is easy to write about him. When I arrived in September, lord how black the prospect was--how <b>desperate,</b> <b>how</b> incurably <b>desperate!</b> Webster and Co. had to have a small sum of money or go under at once. I flew to Hartford--to my friends--but they were not moved, not strongly interested, and I was ashamed that I went. It was from Mr. Rogers, a stranger, that I got the money and was by it saved. And then--while still a stranger--he set himself the task of saving my financial life without putting upon me (in his native delicacy) any sense that I was the recipient of a charity, a benevolence--and he has accomplished that task; accomplished it at a cost of three months of wearing and difficult labor. He gave that time to me--time which could not be bought by any man at a hundred thousand dollars a month--no, nor for three times the money.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{additional}} historical {{differences between the}} book and the movie, presumably made to shorten the length of the movie. [...] Some differences not shown would have demonstrated <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> the American situation at Ia Drang was. For example, the seriousness of the overrun of C Company under the command of Capt. Robert Edwards and the repulse of the final major North Vietnamese push at LZ X-Ray on the former C Company line, which was then held by B Company 2/7th under the command of Capt. Myron Diduryk, the Ukrainian captain who Col. Moore (Mel Gibson) seems to claim is attached to the 1/7th. [...] Also incorrect is the act of Capt. Ramon Nadal pushing forward and rescuing the stranded platoon of Lt. Henry Herrick, which according to the book was actually done not by one company of the 1/7th, but rather by two companies of the 2/5th as well as B Company 1/7th.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November, Motlanthe, the President of South Africa, {{urged the}} parties to reach an agreement, warning {{that if they did}} not, [...] "the {{situation}} will get worse and will implode or collapse altogether". Talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC restarted in South Africa on 25 November, again mediated by Mbeki. Mbeki described the negotiations as [...] "the same as ever, forward and backwards, sideways and around ... the usual". Tsvangirai released a statement on 26 November calling on Mbeki to step down. According to Tsvangirai, Mbeki [...] "does not appear to understand <b>how</b> <b>desperate</b> the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small"; he also accused Mbeki of supporting ZANU-PF and said that the MDC could not [...] "continue negotiating under his facilitation". Two days later, a letter from Mbeki sharply criticising Tsvangirai's position was published. In this letter, Mbeki urged Tsvangirai to [...] "take responsibility for the future of Zimbabwe" [...] instead of devoting himself to [...] "being a militant critic of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF." [...] In response to Tsvangirai's accusation that the SADC leaders lacked the courage to confront Mugabe, Mbeki said that Tsvangirai had [...] "describe us {{in a manner that is}} most offensive in terms of African culture". He also suggested that Tsvangirai perhaps believed [...] "that others further away, in Western Europe and North America, are of greater importance" [...] to Zimbabwe than other countries in the region and Africa as a whole.|$|E

First grain and animals of various kinds were placed in compartments within the statue (as in the Rabbinic account). Then the children were offered, at first a few, and then more and more.|$|R

Mallinson demonstrates how people and events have shaped the army's development. Sections include: how Marlborough's victory at Blenheim is linked to Wellington's success at Waterloo; <b>how</b> the <b>desperate</b> fight at Rorke's Drift in 1879 underpinned the heroism of the airborne forces in Arnhem in 1944; and why Montgomery's momentous victory at El Alamein mattered long after the Second World War.|$|R
