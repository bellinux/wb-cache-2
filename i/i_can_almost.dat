500|$|Steve Wozniak (who {{consulted}} with Sorkin {{before he had}} written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015 {{that he does not}} [...] "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E

5000|$|Interface expert Jef Raskin {{has been}} a strong {{advocate}} of incremental search. In his 2000 book The Humane Interface, he wrote, [...] "From {{the point of view}} of interface engineering, the advantages of incremental searching are so numerous and the advantages of delimited searches so few that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see <b>almost</b> no occasions when a delimited search would be preferred." [...] This was followed by a footnote reading, [...] "A search is either incremental or excremental." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{so much of the}} Italian that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> fancy him an old and tried acquaintance.

6000|$|... "Yes; I've got it!" [...] Eustace answered, half beside {{himself with}} delight. [...] "I've got it! I've got it!

5000|$|Thomas’s plays {{were never}} trendy or fashionable {{and he was}} often {{dismissed}} by French critics and intellectuals. But his public loved him {{and the best of}} his work is elegant and well-constructed. It is also unlike anything else in its peculiar juxtaposition of tension and laughter. Thomas died in 1989 in Paris and, from what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> gather, <b>almost</b> nothing of his work has ever crossed the Channel. So his most celebrated play is surely ripe for re-evaluation ...|$|R

6000|$|... “What miracle is this, Captain Harker?” {{the officer}} cried {{as he came}} on deck. “Your {{lieutenant}} brought us news that you were dismasted and lying helpless in some little inlet, {{and here you are}} with what I can see is a French equipment and a couple of prizes! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>almost</b> accuse you of having brought us here on a fool’s errand.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, father, that is true," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but I had rather {{hear them}} talk. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} <b>almost</b> all they say. And then I {{like to see}} them change horses, and to see the conductor climb up and down. Then, besides, at almost all the villages they have parcels to leave at the inns; and it is good fun to see them take the parcels out and toss them down, and tell the bar maid at the inn what she is to do with them." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither my Utopian double nor I love emotion {{sufficiently}} to cultivate it, and my feelings {{are in a}} state of seemly subordination when we meet again.
