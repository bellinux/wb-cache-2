25|$|Mr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film {{directed}} by Ricky Lau in his directorial debut, and also produced by Sammo Hung. The film's {{box office success}} {{led to the creation}} of a Mr. Vampire franchise, with the release of four sequels {{directed by}} Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1991. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore. The film was released under the Chinese title 暫時停止呼吸 (literally: Hold Your Breath <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Moment)</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.|$|E
500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} pulls his chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E

500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} the glass door, making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon which he was experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers simply want her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' eyes. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing him to feel remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
2500|$|Silbermann {{invented a}} device {{by which the}} player could lift all of the dampers off the strings, {{permitting}} them to vibrate freely, either when struck or sympathetically when other notes were played. [...] This is the function in later pianos of the damper pedal. [...] Silbermann's device {{was different from the}} modern damper pedal in two respects. [...] First, it was not actually controlled by a pedal, but rather was a hand stop, which required the player to cease playing on the keys <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> order to change the damper configuration. [...] Thus, it was a device for imparting an unusual tonal color to whole passages, rather than a means of nuanced expression as the pedal is today. [...] Second, Silbermann's device was bifurcated, permitting the dampers of the treble and bass sections to be lifted separately. [...] This latter feature has recently been reintroduced to the piano, {{in the form of the}} fourth and fifth pedals of pianos made by the Borgato firm; see Innovations in the piano.|$|E
2500|$|However, Istrati's {{connection}} with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in Gringoire, a newspaper of the French far-right. Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name {{on a list of}} [...] "intellectuals [...] saw <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy." [...] He is in the company of Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis. Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: [...] "Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? There is something that those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he {{came face to face with}} the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, je ne marche pas [...] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, should he have lived to see their earliest crimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|An Antislavery {{meeting was}} held at Broadway Hall, in Broadway, above Howard Street, next to the famous Tattersalls. That large, quaint {{building}} stood gable end to the street, and its sloping roof descended just below the side windows of the hall of the meeting. Among other noted speakers Mr Garrison was present; while the exercises were progressing, an onslaught was made upon the meeting by the [...] "plug-uglies," [...] and other ruffians, sworn to exterminate the Abolition fanatics. Armed with sticks and clubs, and with a furious noise, they rushed upon the terrified audience, aiming particularly, however, at the rostrum and the speakers. Mr Garrison was safely got away {{through one of the}} side windows. George Bourne stood forth to receive the [...] "Tammany Braves," [...] and placing his cane before him with hands extended he said, [...] "Stand back, ye villains! What do you want here?

At last one of them swung his hat and cried out [...] "Three cheers for the dominie!" [...] which they gave with a will, and leaving him unmolested, they chased out the remainder of the audience, who were glad to escape without personal violence.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien called another early {{election}} {{in the fall of}} 2000, again hoping {{to take advantage of the}} split in the Canadian right and catch the newly formed Canadian Alliance and its neophyte leader Stockwell Day off guard. At the funeral of Trudeau in September 2000, President of Cuba Fidel Castro happened to meet with Day. Later that same day, Chrétien met with Castro, where Chrétien asked Castro about his assessment of Day and if he should call an {{early election}} or not. Castro advised Chrétien to dissolve Parliament early as he considered Day to be a lightweight, and as Castro was a leader whom Chrétien respected, his advice was an important reason for the election. Finance Minister Paul Martin released a 'mini-budget' just before the election call that included significant tax cuts, a move aimed at undermining the Alliance position going into the campaign. Chrétien formed a [...] "war room" [...] comprising his communications director Françoise Ducros, Warren Kinsella, Duncan Fulton and Kevin Bosch to gather material to attack Day as some sort of fascist who would plunge Canada into the Dark Ages, and to put forward the thesis to the Canadian people that Day had a [...] "hidden agenda", which was so horrifying that Day dared not to reveal it to the people of Canada until after he won power. In the first weeks of the 2000 election, the Canadian Alliance gained in the polls while voters expressed a certain coolness to Chrétien, whom most voters complained had overstayed his time in office and had no agenda beyond staying in power for the sake of staying in power. The fact that the Red Book of 2000 consisted almost entirely of recycled promises from the Red Books of 1993 and 1997 and various banal statements further reinforced the impression of a Prime Minister with no plans or vision for Canada and whose only agenda was to hang onto power as long as possible. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> October 2000 it appeared possible that the Alliance might win the election as the poll numbers continued in its favor. However, the Liberal claim that Day planned to dismantle the health care system to replace it with a [...] "two-tier" [...] health care system together with a number of gaffes on Day's part started to turn opinion decisively against the Canadian Alliance, despite the fact that most voters were growing tired of Chrétien. A CBC report on November 16, 2000, stated: [...] "Transport Minister David Collenette is said to have admitted at a strategy meeting that Chrétien is a problem and voters are saying they want Finance Minister Paul Martin to lead the party". However, the Liberal attacks against Day as a right-wing fanatic affected the voters more than did wariness with Chrétien. The climax of the Liberal effort to paint the Canadian Alliance as a gang of far-right wing extremists came on November 16, 2000, when the Liberal MP Elinor Caplan gave a much publicised speech, in she declared about the rank and file of the Canadian Alliance: [...] "Their supporters are Holocaust deniers, prominent bigots and racists". Leading a certain degree of credibility to the Grit claim that the Alliance was a party of racists was a speech on November 18, 2000, by the Alliance candidate Betty Granger in Winnipeg where she ominously warned that Canada was faced with the threat of an [...] "Asian invasion", by which Granger meant that Canada was accepting too many Asian immigrants for its own good. Historically, the fear of the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] had obsessed Canadians which led to laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923, and Granger's [...] "Asian invasion" [...] speech hearkened back to the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] fears of former times. Through Day promptly apologised, forced Granger to suspend her candidacy and insisted that the Alliance was opposed to racism, the damage had been done, and the Liberals made extensive use of the [...] "Asian invasion" [...] speech to suggest to Canadians, especially Asian-Canadians that the Alliance was a haven of white supremacists'. On November 22, 2000, Chrétien gave a speech in New Brunswick which in which he implied that people from Alberta were not quite normal, saying: [...] "I like to do politics with people from the East. Joe Clark and Stockwell Day are from Alberta. They are a different type".|$|E
