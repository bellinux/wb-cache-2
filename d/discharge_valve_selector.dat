50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{never have}} a suction valve, but depending on the application {{may or may not}} have a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The use of a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The use of a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> improves scroll compressor efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|R

40|$|The flow {{coefficient}} of a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> system with lift height was functionalized by experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulation {{to predict the}} mass flow rate through a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> system in a rolling piston compressor with different compressor frequency and operating conditions. The {{flow coefficient}}s of the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> system were determined by both experiments and CFD simulation for specifically configured condition with varying <b>discharge</b> port diameter, <b>valve</b> lift height and valve shape to consider operating and geometric conditions.

In order to verify the reliability of CFD simulation, the computational results were compared with those of experiment. The flow coefficient maps for each <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> system could be obtained from the computational results. The functional flow coefficient model was derived from the maps. It was applied to compressor performance simulation to calculate mass flow rate at the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> system as a function of diameter of discharge port and lift height of the valve. Energy Efficiency Ratio(EER) obtained from the functional flow coefficient model with varying compressor frequency showed good agreement with experimental data.

50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed switch valves. Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed switch valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the charging <b>valve</b> 1 and <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are open, and the <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (FigureÂ  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging <b>valve</b> 1 and <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of advance signal {{processing}} techniques for the classification of four common reciprocating compressor conditions. Non-stationary vibration signals from the compressor are decomposed based on two emerging techniques: WPT (Wavelet Packet Transform) and EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and harmonic changes of the optimal components of each technique are used for condition monitoring and diagnostics of the machine. Performance comparison of WPT and EMD is done for the envelope analysis of the optimal wavelet packet and the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) component that can extract salient features of the four compressor conditions including one normal and three fault conditions (intercooler leakage, <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> leakage and the combination of intercooler and <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> leakage). Harmonic changes produced after envelope analysis of the best packet and IMF component are used for classification and results show that WPT technique is more robust and effective in fault classification compared to EMD...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an analytical investigation on the practicability of using mechanically operated <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> in conjunction with a manually operated intake control for improving the performance of N. A. C. A. Roots type superchargers. These valves, which may be either of the oscillating or rotating type, are placed in the discharge opening of the supercharger and are so shaped and synchronized with the supercharger impellers that they do not open until the air has been compressed to the delivery pressure. The intake control limits the quantity of air compressed to engine requirements by permitting the excess air to escape from the compression chamber before compression begins. The percentage power saving and the actual horsepower saved were computed for altitudes from 0 to 20, 000 feet. These computations are based on the pressure-volume cards for the conventional and the modified roots type superchargers and on the results of laboratory tests of the conventional type. The use of <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> shows a power saving of approximately 26 per cent at a critical altitude of 20, 000 feet. In addition, these valves reduce the amplitude of the discharge pulsations and increase the volumetric efficiency. With slow-speed roots blowers operating at high-pressure differences even better results would be expected. For aircraft engine superchargers operating at high speeds these <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> increase the performance as above, but have the disadvantages of increasing the weight and of adding a high-speed mechanism to a simple machine.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} large-eddy simulation (LES) to predict the performance of hermetic reciprocating compressors utilized in refrigeration. In such devices the pressure difference between the suction/discharge chamber and the cylinder, established by the piston motion, {{is responsible for the}} valve opening. Once the valves are open, the flow dictates the pressure distribution on the valve reed surface and, consequently, the resultant force that will govern the valve dynamics and its displacement from the seat. The methodology developed herein applies LES, combined with the Smagorinsky sub-grid model, to account for the compressible turbulent flow through the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> A one-degree of freedom model is adopted for the valve dynamics, and a finite volume methodology to solve the flow field throughout the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> For the remainder of the compression cycle, an integral formulation is employed, with effective flow and force areas being used to evaluate the dynamics and mass flow rate for the suction valve. Numerical results demonstrate that the methodology is capable of predicting important flow features in the discharge process, at a reasonable computational cost...|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable.
