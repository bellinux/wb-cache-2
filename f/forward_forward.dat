60|$|Now came a swift command, and the English ranks rose {{to their}} feet, uncased their bows and strung them all as though {{with a single}} hand. A second command and every bow was bent. A third and with a noise that was half hiss and half moan, {{thousands}} of arrows leapt <b>forward.</b> <b>Forward</b> they leapt, and swift and terrible they fell among {{the ranks of the}} advancing Genoese. Yes, and ere ever one had found its billet, its quiver-mate was hastening on its path. Then--oh! the sunlight showed it all--the Genoese rolled over by scores, their frail armour bitten through and through by the grey English arrows. By scores that grew to hundreds, that grew till the poor, helpless men who were yet unhurt among them wailed out in their fear, and, after one short, hesitant moment, surged back upon the long lines of men-at-arms behind.|$|E
6000|$|The March {{proceeded}} {{through the}} old Country; a little to left of the track in June past: Roder Water, Pulsnitz Water; Kamenz neighborhood, Bautzen neighborhood,--Bunzlau on Silesian ground. Daun, at Bischofswerda, had foreseen this March; and, by his Light people, had spoiled the Road all he could; broken all the Bridges, HALF-felled the Woods (to render them impassable). Daun, the instant he heard of the actual March, rose from Bischofswerda: <b>forward,</b> <b>forward</b> always, to be ahead of it, however rapid; Lacy, hanging on the rear of it, willing to give trouble with his Pandour harpies, but studious above all {{that it should not}} whirl round anywhere and get upon his, Lacy's, own throat. One of the strangest marches ever seen. [...] "An on-looker, who had observed the march of these different Armies," [...] says Friedrich, [...] "would have thought that they all belonged to one leader. Feldmarschall Daun's he would have taken for the Vanguard, the King's for the main Army, and General Lacy's for the Rear-guard." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, v. 56.] Tempelhof says: [...] "It is given only to a Friedrich to march on those terms; between Two hostile Armies, his equals in strength, and a Third [Loudon's, in Striegau Country] waiting ahead." ...|$|E
