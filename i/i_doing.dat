25|$|Two {{years after}} the start of his {{collaboration}} with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, Sergio Corbucci. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's Navajo Joe (1966), The Hellbenders (1967), The Mercenary/The Professional Gun (1968), The Great Silence (1968), Compañeros (1970), Sonny and Jed (1972) and What Am <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> in the Middle of the Revolution? (1972).|$|E
500|$|Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles Chatwin included in What Am <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here. The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby's, and some of his final writing focused on this. The final section of What Am <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here, [...] "Tales from the Art World," [...] consists of four short stories on this topic. At the end of What Am <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here, Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward, who told him [...] "Never let anything artistic stand in your way." [...] Chatwin stated, [...] "I've always acted on that advice." ...|$|E

McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am <b>I</b> <b>doing?</b> What am <b>I</b> <b>doing?</b> Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E

The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.'

500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Patagonia, Chatwin {{discovered}} a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a nineteenth-century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey (present day Benin). Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa {{during a visit to}} Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt took place, and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary, arrested, and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in [...] "A Coup—A Story," [...] which was published in Granta and included in What Am <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> Here (1989).|$|E
500|$|He {{restored}} the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, {{his home in}} Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including [...] "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the [...] garden. Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E

Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is [...] "Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) {{in a city of}} lethal illusions". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, you ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road."

500|$|In September 2010 he {{went out}} on another month's loan, this time to League One club Walsall, where he had spent time as a junior. The Birmingham Mail {{reported}} that on his debut, in a defeat at Rochdale, he had [...] "a quiet first half but showed some impressive touches {{in the second period}} and fitted well into Walsall's 4–3–3 formation." [...] His captain, Darren Byfield, [...] "thought David was superb. Usually when you have players who love to tackle and get in your face, they can't use the ball– but he was playing balls around the corners and off the strikers. You can see already he's not one of those who come from the Premiership thinking 'what am <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> here?' He's listening to people and his attitude is superb." [...] He played the whole of Walsall's six matches during his initial month, apart from the last 15 minutes against Swindon Town when he was stretchered off with an injured ankle. The first five of those sixfour losses and a drawsaw Walsall drop from 13th place to bottom of the table, and, again according to the Mail, Davis [...] "did as well as can be expected from a 19-year-old pitched into a team in freefall". The loan was extended for another month, but because Wolves had injury problems, manager Mick McCarthy included a clause allowing them to recall him at 24 hours notice if they needed him. Davis played just once more for Walsall before he was recalled. With three first-team midfielders unavailable, McCarthy included him on the bench for Wolves' Premier League visit to Chelsea; he remained unused.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew."

2500|$|In September 1967, Pryor {{had what}} he {{described}} in his autobiography Pryor Convictions (1995) as an [...] "epiphany".

Afterward, Pryor began working profanity into his act, including the word [...] "nigger". His first comedy recording, the eponymous 1968 debut release on the Dove/Reprise label, captures this particular period, tracking the evolution of Pryor's routine. Around this time, his parents died—his mother in 1967 and his father in 1968.|$|E
