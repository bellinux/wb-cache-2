500|$|During the {{immediate}} post-UDI period Beadle, {{in his role}} as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main players—Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in case of necessity. He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's Attorney General Elwyn Jones, was [...] "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that he was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle [...] "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK Foreign Office remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia [...] "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," [...] the Chief Justice [...] "would be content to see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".|$|E

5000|$|With {{the demise}} of the Swing era and the decline of the great touring big bands, a major change in jazz music occurred. The advent of bebop led to new {{developments}} in Fitzgerald's vocal style, influenced by her work with Dizzy Gillespie's big band. It was in this period that Fitzgerald started including scat singing as a major part of her performance repertoire. While singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald recalled, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my voice what I heard the horns in the band doing." ...|$|R

We <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything the best we could ... and worked harder on the songs." [...] A few of the album's songs were written prior to recording; most of them were written as the recording process was underway, which allowed the band to be more creative.|$|R

Three versions of the room were built so Fincher could film scenes from multiple angles. A 3D computer model of the set on the soundstage was designed. Fincher, who had done pre-visualization for Fight Club, used the model to design shots and decide their sequence. The computer model also enabled the camera to have [...] "total freedom to travel" [...] inside the house. Fincher said, [...] "What we were <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with CG was to say, there's no camera operator, there's no crew, there's no track, and the camera can go everywhere." [...] The crew applied photogrammetry—"mapping still images {{over the surface of}} computer-generated 'sets'". The filming schedule was also shortened since camera setups could be evaluated and discarded virtually. Fincher had two-thirds of Panic Rooms shots planned before the start of filming. Director Steven Soderbergh reviewed Fincher's test footage and warned him that excessive planning would make actual production difficult for him.|$|E

After telling Christmas the thematic and musical direction Cult of Luna was aiming for with Mariner, the band gave her full creative control to write and perform how she best saw fit.

He is also the most mild-mannered among all the Buddyloids, never once bicker with anyone over anything and always <b>just</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what he can to help around. Gorisaki mainly does back-up work for the Go-Busters as a mechanic. Unlike other Buddyloids who watched their partners grow up, Ryuji was already a teenager when the two met. As Ryuji is quite mature for his age and carries himself in a rather proper manner all the time, Gorisaki feels that he is not as close to Ryuji as the other two Buddyloids are with their partners, seeing their dysfunctional moments to be a good thing. As a result, Gorisaki always holds back when he talks to Ryuji and resorts to more discreet methods like eavesdropping to know his partner better. However, when he sustains damage to protect his partner from Fanloid, Gorisaki is happy that Ryuji finally scolds him for his recklessness, feeling that for they finally made progress as partners. After the fight, Ryuji encourages Gorisaki to tell him everything he wants to say without holding back. To Ryuji's chagrin however, Gorisaki begins to run his mouth off in expressing his feelings soon after.|$|R
