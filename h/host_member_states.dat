40|$|Recent {{case-law}} of the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) on {{the rights}} of third-country nationals (TCNs) reveals the introduction of an 'integration exception': guarantees of equal treatment of TCNs are not applicable if the measures causing uneqaul treatment aim to promote the TCNs' integration in the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> As a result equal treatment of TCNs, including in the field of social rights, is made subject to a requirement of prior integration. This chapter analyses the case law on the integration exception and sheds light on its doctrinal and theoretical implications. It argues that the introduction of the integration exception marks the reinforcement of an 'exclusionary' approach to the integration of TCNs under EU law, which was already visible in the field of immigration and is now extended to the domain of social rights...|$|E

Following the introduction, the thesis itself focuses on the positive and negative delimitation of the concept. One of the core chapters of the "positive part" tries to find an answer on the research question whether any "Keck-like" principle exists as a criterion for defining obstacles to the free movement of workers. The aim of the chapter is to find an answer what shall be subsumed under the obstacles to free movement of workers and what are Member States left with to regulate freely on their territories. In regard with the negative delimitation of the concept, the author deals with the diversion between workers and non-economically active citizens of the EU.

This report analyses these practical problems and the relevant domestic rules, followed by normative recommendations. First, the statistical analysis revealed that corporate mobility is only a partial reality in the EU. Second, an empirical survey of lawyers from all Member States found, inter alia, that there is considerable legal uncertainty regarding {{the subject matter of}} this report in many of the Member States and that respondents support a possible harmonisation of conflict of laws rules. Third, the comparative part of the report provides a thorough analysis of the conflict of laws rules applicable to companies in all 28 Member States, based upon reports drafted by national correspondents from each Member State. Fourth, in the normative analysis, we recommend harmonisation of the relevant conflict of laws rules in a new ‘Rome V Regulation’.

40|$|This note {{addresses}} certain complications {{inherent in}} governance {{with regards to}} posted workers, i. e. workers posted on a temporary basis from one Member State of the Union to another, {{for the provision of}} services in the host Member State. In particular, this note attempts to explain how the current Directive 96 / 71 /EC (the Posted Workers' Directive) sets out mechanisms that produce socially inefficient levels of minimum protections for such posted workers that have to be provided by their employers. This note argues that none of the methods by which <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> may set such levels of minimum protection (namely positive legislation, universally binding collective agreements, and other qualifying collective agreements) allow for real and credible participation by, and representation of, such posted workers, so much so that this is arguably a defining characteristic of the Directive. Whatever response the competent Community institutions may take, a way will have to be found to provide for sufficient outlets for the voice of posted workers, in order to achieve socially efficient levels of minimum protection. Finally, this note examines how such outlets for the voice of posted workers can be created within the mechanisms envisaged by the draft recommendation of the Commission issued on April 3, 2008...|$|E
40|$|Benefit tourism as a {{problematic}} aspect in the EU Benefit tourism {{is a topic}} which has gotten {{quite a lot of}} media attention lately, has influenced the lives of mobile EU citizens as well as the EU itself in connection with the brexit. The aim of this thesis is to provide the reader with a comprehensive portrait of the topic, and to explore how is this phenomenon reflected in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU. In addition to dealing with the political context and the notion of benefit tourism, this thesis explores the free movement of persons based on both, the economic and the non-economic basis. The focus of the thesis lays on the case-law of CJEU relative to the access of economically inactive EU citizens to the social assistance systems of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> particularly the judicial chain Brey - Dano - Alimanovic - García-Nieto. These judgments are revolutionary in a way, because for the first time, the Court took into account also the "public finances" argument which has been raised by the Member States for years and the CJEU has always been adamant on rejecting it in favour of wider interpretation of social rights. The CJEU abandoned its previous stands on the financial solidarity, equal treatment and the extension of EU citizens' rights of socially inactive EU citizens and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, certain European Union (EU) {{initiatives}} {{such as the}} Erasmus programme provided the opportunity to {{a great number of}} academics, researchers and students to move for {{a relatively short period of}} time to other EU member states in order to enhance their skills and improve their career potential (a phenomenon known as ‘brain circulation’). The popularity of particular member states such as Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdoom has gradually created an influx of highly skilled staff especially from the less developed EU member states, from Southern Europe and the former Eastern European countries. The proposed changes in the EU Higher Education and Research frameworks during the 1990 s and the 2000 s encupsulated in the Bologna and Lisbon initiatives respectively, have had controversial results. In addition, the internationalisation and to a great extent the (competitive) commercialisation of Higher Education (HE) has left many EU member states behind since they failed to reform their national HE systems. A masive exodus of academics and researchers was observed from 2008 until 2017, mainly from the countries that suffered more the consequeses of the economic crisis (Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus). The destination (host) countries included primarily locations within the EU, with the most popular being the the UK and Germany. The mass emigration of academic staff within and outside the EU (‘brain drain’) is causing loss of highly skilled human capital with catastrophic consequenses for the sending (home) countries.

40|$|This article treats {{migration}} {{within the}} territory of the European Union (EU) <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> by Union citizens and their families; focusing on freedom of movement and education. Specifically, it will examine student maintenance grant eligibility in the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> facilitative of student mobility in the EU, in accordance with primary and secondary EU legislation on freedom of movement of EU workers and of EU citizens. It is submitted that the interpretation of EU law by the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) in recent cases lacks coherency and consistency. Primary provisions of EU law prescribe the right freely to move and reside for economically active EU citizens, and for EU citizens of independent means inclusive of students, who do not become an unreasonable burden on the welfare system of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality between <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> has played a pivotal role in the interpretation by the Court of Justice of EU citizenship free movement rights. Secondary EU law reinforces the principle of equality of treatment with nationals of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> in relation to the education of the children of EU citizen economic migrant workers. The Court of Justice in consecutive rulings has interpreted EU law expansively confirming independent residence rights for children of the migrant worker who are in education. A derived right then ensues for the primary carer of such children, irrespective of his or her nationality. As a result of two recent and controversial rulings of the Court, both independent and derived residence rights exist in the absence of financial self sufficiency. This, in spite of further secondary EU legislation agreed to by <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> requiring economically inactive migrant EU citizens and family members to have sufficient resources so as not to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> moreover, have agreed expressly in the EU Citizenship Directive that they reserve the right not to pay maintenance grant /loan funding to EU citizen students who have crossed a border in order to study in that <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> These two recent rulings emphasise the importance accorded in EU law to the concept of the economically active EU migrant worker, despite a lack of sufficient means, and the associated Treaty principle of equality of treatment without discrimination on grounds of nationality for migrant EU workers. The ability to manage its own education system is stated expressly in the Treaties to be the responsibility of each individual <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> The consequences of these rulings potentially will impact upon the public resources budgeted for schooling and thereafter higher University education inclusive of maintenance funding on the part of each <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> Stat...|$|R

50|$|The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held Ms Dano did {{not have}} {{sufficient}} resources and could not claim a right of residence in Germany. Therefore, they could not invoke the principle of non-discrimination in the Directive and Regulation. The Citizens Rights Directive article 24(2) did not require granting social assistance {{in the first three}} months of residence. The right to equal treatment depends on ‘residing on the basis of this Directive’. Under article 7(1)(b) that requires one to ‘have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system’. For residence between three months and five years, economically inactive persons should have sufficient resources of their own to prevent a <b>host</b> <b>member</b> <b>state’s</b> welfare system being used as a means of subsistence. A <b>member</b> <b>state</b> should be able to refuse social assistance to economically inactive citizens. Domestic law can exclude migrants from ‘special non-contributory cash benefits’ although they are granted to nationals of the <b>host</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> who are in the same situation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{evaluate}} {{the heart of the}} concept of citizenship of the European Union: namely, freedom of movement and residence. The evolution of citizenship, from its inception in the Maastricht Treaty, as a political concept will be treated. Freedom of movement and residence, with its rights and limitations, historically and legally accrued to economically active persons. Non-economically active persons have been given rights in secondary legislation to move and to reside subject to specified conditions and limitations. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, in accordance with which the link with economic in dependence and the freedom to move and reside has been broken, will be critically appraised. Resort to the principle of non discrimination on grounds of nationality in Article 12 of the European Community Treaty, read in conjunction with the citizenship provisions in Articles 17 and 18 EC, has resulted in legal rights for nationals of European Union <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> who are lawfully resident in, and who do not become an unreasonable burden on, the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Enforceable at the suit of individuals, EU citizenship has given rise to social advantages for non-economic actors. Citizenship has become a legal source of rights be yond those agreed to by the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> the legitimacy for which lies with the degree of financial solidarity accorded under the principle of non-discrimination and the level of integration of a particular EU citizen into the society of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> The need to establish a real link and the proportionate legitimate interests of the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> are limits to citizenship as a source of rights.
