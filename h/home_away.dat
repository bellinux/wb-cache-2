5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home {{by a series of}} governesses and tutors. She {{displayed}} artistic talent early, drawing and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she privately issued The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success. She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes in the years to follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit. In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from London and her artistic retreat. In a few years, Potter had established her own career, income, and home.|$|E
5|$|The crest was {{altered in}} 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons – {{one at the}} top, with Animo et Fide, and one at the bottom with Stockport County F.C.. In addition, the {{football}} was again removed from the shield. The Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer Umbro who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013–14 season, replacing Nike, thus making County the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013–14 season. For {{the start of the}} 2014–15 season, County again changed their kit manufacturer, this time from Umbro to Spanish-based manufacturer Joma which supplied County with a new <b>Home,</b> <b>Away</b> and Third kit along with training wear.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

25|$|Tunney cut Watson {{in on the}} {{business}} side of things. Their combined booking efforts resulted in large fortunes for the two of them. With connections to St. Louis promoter Tom Packs, Watson’s notoriety resulted in Watson ending Longson’s four year title reign with a victory at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on February 21, 1947. The territory of St. Louis became a <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from home for Watson. More than 10,000 St. Louis fans watched local hero Lou Thesz beat Watson for the world title on April 25, 1947. After Packs retired in 1948, Tunney bought into the territory in St. Louis and this resulted in many more matches for Watson in the city.|$|E
25|$|October 3, 1924 was {{the first}} time Roosevelt {{traveled}} to Warm Springs, Georgia and it soon became his <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from home. For many years to come Warm Springs would be where Franklin would retreat in comfort and do hydrotherapy for his legs. On April 29, 1926 he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients. One of Roosevelt's major goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health. It is now the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the State of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Playoffs: The six {{best teams}} at the {{conclusion}} of regular season proceed directly to quarter-finals. Teams placing between seventh and tenth (inclusive) will play preliminary play-offs best-out-of-three – the two winners take the last two slots to quarter-finals. Starting from the season 2007–2008 all series since then are best-of-seven. Losers of the semi-finals play a bronze medal match. Teams are paired up for each round according to regular season results so that the highest-ranking team will play against the lowest-ranking, second highest against the second lowest, and so on. Higher-ranking teams play the first match at home, then by turns away, <b>home,</b> <b>away,</b> etc. Each playoff match consists of a 60-minute regulation time which {{in the event of a}} tie is followed by extra 20-minute periods of 5-on-5 sudden death overtime, in which the first team to score wins.|$|E

25|$|From around 1952, {{when she}} gave her Met farewell, until her death 10 years later, Flagstad's health {{steadily}} deteriorated.

She even joked with an interviewer in 1958 that Oslo hospital had become her <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from home. From 1958 to 1960, Flagstad was the first Director of the Norwegian National Opera. In her last years she gave many benefit concerts throughout Norway. She was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 1960 and died of the disease on 7 December 1962.

500|$|Zecker {{remarked that}} in an ironic twist, {{immediately}} after the riots, Desdemona's family is shamed by a white realtor who [...] "doubts their fitness (whiteness)" [...] {{to live in the}} rich city Grosse Point. In the 1970s, African Americans, instead of Mediterraneans, were discriminated against through redlining. Zecker opined that by framing African Americans as the [...] "eternal destroyers" [...] and white ethnics as [...] "yet again the oppressed innocents", Eugenides [...] "captures perfectly the dominant narrative of urban decline in the early twenty-first century American Zeitgeist." [...] Insurance settlement from the damage caused at the riots allows the Stephanides to purchase a <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from the African Americans. The family participates in the white flight from the city to avoid the racial desegregation in the public schools, sending Cal to a private school.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} on stage nearly every weekend, even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers. The band soon {{became part of}} a circuit that also {{included}} the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma, a local all-ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline. Big-name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played {{on the main floor}}, while smaller acts were relegated to the basement, an area referred to as [...] "the Dungeon". The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage (which required a 100+ crowd to attend). [...] "Soma was like <b>home</b> <b>away</b> from home. All the punk kids who didn’t give a fuck about football games and proms or whatever came to hang out at Soma," [...] claimed Hoppus. The band's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday, where the band opened for Face to Face. Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime. The result was Buddha (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release. By this time, the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon, but Raynor's family relocated to Reno, Nevada, and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull. The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure.|$|E
