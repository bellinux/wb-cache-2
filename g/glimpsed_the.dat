2500|$|At first {{all went}} well. Panjandrum {{rolled into the}} sea and began {{to head for the}} shore, the Brass Hats {{watching}} through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began to lurch ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he looked up from his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1914, Schiele <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> sisters Edith and Adéle Harms, {{who lived}} with their parents {{across the street from}} his studio in the Viennese {{district}} of Hietzing, 101 Hietzinger Hauptstraße. They were a middle-class family and Protestant by faith; their father was a master locksmith. In 1915, Schiele chose to marry the more socially acceptable Edith, but had apparently expected to maintain a relationship with Wally. However, when he explained the situation to Wally, she left him immediately and never saw him again. This abandonment led him to paint Death and the Maiden, where Wally's portrait is based on a previous pairing, but Schiele's is newly struck. (In February 1915, Schiele wrote a note to his friend Arthur Roessler stating: [...] "I intend to get married, advantageously. Not to Wally.") Despite some opposition from the Harms family, Schiele and Edith were married on 17 June 1915, the anniversary of the wedding of Schiele's parents.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first women}} {{involved}} in exploration of Antarctica were wives and companions of male travelers and explorers. Women accompanied men as [...] "whaling wives" [...] to Antarctic waters. The first women {{to see the}} continent of Antarctica was Norwegian Ingrid Christensen and her companion, Mathilde Wegger, {{both of whom were}} traveling with Christensen's husband. The first woman to step onto the land of Antarctica, an island, was Caroline Mikkelsen in 1935. Mikkelsen only briefly went ashore, and was also there with her husband. Later, after her husband died, Mikkelsen remarried and didn't talk about her experience in Antarctica in order [...] "to spare his feelings." [...] Christensen went back to Antarctica three times after she first <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> land. She eventually landed at Scullin Monolith, becoming the first woman to set foot on the Antarctic mainland, followed by her daughter, Augusta Sofie Christensen, and two other women: Lillemor Rachlew, and Solveig Widerøe. Because the women believed the landing wasn't an actual [...] "first," [...] they didn't make much of their accomplishment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of Hamlet as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living antithesis to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough {{not to be able}} to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the Primordial Unity, which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [...] Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the physiological condition that enables making of any art. Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of combined electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) {{in terms of}} speech recognition in noise are well established; however the underlying factors responsible for this benefit are not clear. The present study tests the hypothesis that having access to acoustic information in the low frequencies {{makes it easier for}} listeners to <b>glimpse</b> <b>the</b> target. Normal-hearing listeners were presented with vocoded speech alone (V), low-pass (LP) filtered speech alone, combined vocoded and LP speech (LP+V) and with vocoded stimuli constructed so that the low-frequency envelopes were easier to glimpse. Target speech was mixed with two types of maskers (steady-state noise and competing talker) at − 5 to 5 dB signal-to-noise ratios. Results indicated no advantage of LP+V in steady noise, but a significant advantage over V in the competing talker background, an outcome consistent with the notion that it is easier for listeners to <b>glimpse</b> <b>the</b> target in fluctuating maskers. A significant improvement in performance was noted with <b>the</b> modified <b>glimpsed</b> stimuli over <b>the</b> original vocoded stimuli. These findings taken together suggest that a significant factor contributing to the EAS advantage is the enhanced ability to <b>glimpse</b> <b>the</b> target...|$|R
60|$|De Soto merely <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> river, then {{died and}} {{was buried in}} it by his priests and {{soldiers}}. One would expect the priests and the soldiers to multiply the river's dimensions by ten--the Spanish custom of the day--and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On the contrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite that amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites during a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One may 'sense' the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it up in this way: After De Soto <b>glimpsed</b> <b>the</b> river, a fraction short of {{a quarter of a}} century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a trifle more than half a century, then died; and when he had been in his grave considerably more than half a century, the SECOND white man saw the Mississippi. In our day we don't allow a hundred and thirty years to elapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should discover a creek in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe and America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to explore the creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other.|$|E
