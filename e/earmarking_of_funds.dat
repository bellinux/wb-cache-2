40|$|Earmarked {{funds are}} {{mentioned}} in the Polish Public Finances Act {{as one of the}} five organisational legal forms of budget management. This article deals with their legal status. Establishing the legal status <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> requires a comparative analysis based on administrative and tax law. As an introduction the author discussed the notion <b>of</b> a <b>fund</b> both in colloquial and legal language. Next she analysed the dogmatic and legal definition of this notion on the basis of regulations in force and the doctrine of financial law, pointing to inaccuracies in legal regulations. As a result there are considerable interpretative difficulties e. g. in establishing a catalogue <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds.</b> From the financial and legal point of view it was necessary to consider the legal nature c f revenue and expenditure and the nature of financial plan <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds.</b> The relation between plans <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> and budgetary acts and resolutions was also emphasised. The issues of the legal from <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> and the nature of property administered by the funds required a civil legal analysis. The analysis of administrative legal status <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> is based on the organisational and territorial structures <b>of</b> particular <b>funds,</b> the nature and competence <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> agencies. It seems that the essence <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> was not taken into consideration properly in the Polish tax law. Earmarked funds functioning on the basis of regulations in the Public Finances Act enjoy exemption from tax. Still, the way the issue is settled is debatable. Legal forms on which earmarked funds are based are non-uniform and casuistic. For that reason establishing a catalogue of universal legal properties <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> is problematic...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the role of public finance in the {{economic}} development of Newfoundland since 1949. The thesis starts with a discussion of some of the imminent economic problems of the Province and a description of those features of its economy which have bearing on public revenue and expenditure. A short history of public finance in the Island is sketched from the second half of the 19 th century highlighting the financial features which culminated in Confederation in 1949. A survey of public revenue. and public expenditure is presented with a view to show how I conducive the structure of revenue and pattern of expenditure is to the development of Newfoundland The accuracy of revenue is discussed and the elasticity of individual· tax revenues is calculated. Finally capital formation is discussed in relation to fiscal policy and comparison is made between public and private capital formation. Some of the principal findings of this thesis are: 1. Although the revenue from provincial sources has increased rapidly yet the federal aid remains the biggest source of revenue. 2. The common argument that conditional grants distort the provincial priorities does not apply in the case of Newfoundland. 3. Revenue raised from provincial sources suffers from a high degree of rigidity due to <b>earmarking</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> for certain uses and due to low elasticity of tax revenue 4. The revenue estimates suffer from a bias towards under estimation and there is no definite evidence of improvement in them. 5. While public expenditure on material and supplies has been increasing over the years, social welfare has remained the top priority despite the inadequacy of social capital. 6. Public capital formation accounts for a high share of total capital formation and the gross rate of public capital accumulation has been much higher than that of the private...|$|E

40|$|The hope in {{undertaking}} {{this study}} was to make a comparative evaluation of the myriad of federal legislative proposals introduced to provide some financial support for education. However,education is a tremendously broad area of study; furthermore, the span of time through which it has presented significant public issues is great. The need to render this study manageable,and {{at the same time to}} concentrate on issues of current importance and interest, led, therefore, to the exclusion of other topics from consideration. Consequently, the federal legislative proposals examined are only those which would have provided federal financial supportforprimaryandsecondary education in the United States. The vitally important subject of federal aid for higher education lies dormant, awaiting study by someone else. Nor have the proposals to create new educational programs (such as those designed to facilitate education of gifted or mentally retarded children) in primary and secondary schools,nor plans to aid education by underwriting loans to school districts or state school agencies, nor the vitally important proposals to aid adult and vocational education been considered. Also omitted from this study is consideration of programs, whether operating or proposed, to provide aid for schools in the so-called federally impacted areas. In short, the federal aid proposals evaluated in this study are limited to those which: (1) involved direct financial support, (2) embraced all primary and secondary schools in all of the states, and (3) did not provide for <b>earmarking</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> Federal aid proposals examined here are those which were introduced since the end of World War II. The impact of that war on education and specifically on the problem of financing education is well known. The problem of financing education in the foreseeable future, too, seems compelling enough to justify limiting this study to the postwar years. The methods of analysis and the sources of statistical information used are not without limitation. While the limitations are indicated throughout this study, a prefatory statement seems advisable. The results of this study are as reliable as the conscientious use of methods and sources available to me enables them to be. However, it is hoped that subsequent refinement specifically in theories of tax shifting and incidence, in expenditure theory, and in factual information about state distributions of income, expenditures, and other variables, will enable other interested persons to improve both on my techniques of analysis and on the preciseness of my results...|$|E
40|$|Congressional earmarks {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} political debate in recent years. Also known as “pork barrel spending,” earmarks are budgetary requests made by a single legislator that typically circumvent the traditional competitive bidding process designed to ensure the efficient use of public dollars. Utilizing annual state-level estimates of pork barrel spending, we briefly examine the factors influencing states’ receipt <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> from Congress. Results indicate that on average smaller states receive the largest amount <b>of</b> per capita <b>earmarked</b> <b>funding,</b> most likely as a result of their disproportionate influence in the Senate.

For example, estimates of the returns to density (jobs per square mile) are only slightly changed when using citation-weighted patents as the dependent variable. But estimates of returns to city size (urbanization effects) are quite sensitive to the choice of dependent variable.; Local human capital is the most important determinant of per capita rates of patenting. A 1 percent increase in the adult population with a college degree increases the local patenting rate by about 1 percent.; With few exceptions, there is little variation across fields of science in the contribution of academic R&D to patenting rates. The exceptions are computer and life sciences, where the effects are smaller. There is greater variation in the contribution <b>of</b> R&D <b>funded</b> by different sources-academic R&D funded by the federal government generates smaller increases in patenting rates than R&D funded by the university itself. This effect is somewhat stronger for federally funded applied R&D than for basic R&D.

The authors summarize an extensive research project they directed that included a survey of every state that offers a lottery, a general population survey of Georgia citizen attitudes toward the lottery, and results from an economic model summarizing the economic effects of the lottery. The analysis reveals that the Georgia lottery {{has been a significant}} source of revenue for the state's budget and operates in an administratively cost-effective manner. The analysis also confirms the conventional wisdom that lower-income households spend a greater proportionate share of their income on the lottery and that African Americans are more frequent players than whites. Furthermore, the Georgia lottery enjoys broad public support, the key to which appears to be the <b>earmarking</b> <b>of</b> lottery <b>funds</b> to specific, new, popular education programs. However, the data reveal that those educational programs promulgated by the Georgia lottery benefit citizens from both high and low socioeconomic status. Finally, the article suggests that lottery-generated funds may reach a plateau or peak during the first decade of implementation and that state policymakers should design lottery-funded programs accordingly.
