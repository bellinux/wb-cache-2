40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} toxic {{activities of}} essential oils obtained from Rosmarinus officinalis and Lavandula stoechas against the fourth larval instars of Orgyia trigotephras. Methods: A total of 1 200 larvae {{were divided into}} three groups-I, II, III. Group I {{was to investigate the}} effect of extracted essential oils from these aromatic plants as gastric disturbance. Bacillus thuringiensis was used as referencee and ethanol as control. Group II was used as contact action and Group III was used as <b>fumigant</b> <b>action.</b> For both Groups II and III, Decis was used as reference and ethanol as control. During the three experiments, the effect of essential oils on larvae was assessed. Results: The chemical composition of essential oils from two medicinal plants was determined, and their insecticidal effects on the fourth larval state of Orgyia trigotephras were assessed. They presented an insecticidal activity. Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil was less efficient compared to Lavandula stoechas. Conclusions: The relationship between the chemical composition and the biological activities is confirmed by the present findings. Therefore the potential uses of these essential oils as bioinsecticides can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} use of synthetic products...|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: In {{view of the}} {{recently}} increased interest in developing plant origin insecticides {{as an alternative to}} chemical insecticide, this study was undertaken to assess the fumigant and contact toxicity of crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf (Apocynaceae) against larvae and adult Sitophilus oryzae. Methods: Leaves were collected and dried crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf was done with Soxhlet’s extractor in distilled water for 8 hrs. Extracts were concentrated using rotary evaporator (BUCHI B- 850) under reduced pressure at 60 ºC. Bioefficacy of crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf was evaluated under laboratory conditions using 10, 14 and 18 th Results: The fumigant and contact toxicity of crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf exhibited higher toxicity against rice weevil. After 24 hours of exposure period fumigant and contact toxicity LD day larvae and adult Rice weevil. 50 values were 0. 027 mg cm- 2 and 0. 083 mg cm- 2 Interpretation & conclusion: From the results it can be concluded that the larvae and adult rice weevil were susceptible to crude aqueous extract of Catharanthus roeus leaf. Such findings would be useful in promoting research aiming at the development of new bio-insecticides for rice weevil control based on bioactive chemical compounds from Catharanthus roeus leaf an alternative to chemical insecticides. respectively.

40|$|Certain {{essential}} plant oils, {{widely used}} as fragrances and #avors in the perfume and food industries, {{have long been}} reputed to repel insects. Recent investigations in several countries con"rm that some plant essential oils not only repel insects, but have contact and <b>fumigant</b> insecticidal <b>actions</b> against speci"c pests, and fungicidal actions against some important plant pathogens. As part of an e!ort aimed at the development of reduced-risk pesticides based on plant essential oils, toxic and sublethal e!ects of some essential oil terpenes and phenols have been investigated using the tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura) and the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) as model pest species. In this paper I review (i) the range of biological activities of essential oils and their constituents; (ii) their toxicity and proposed mode-of-action in insects; (iii) their potential health and environmental impacts as crop protectants; and (iv) commercialization of pesticides based on plant essential oils.

40|$|The insecticidal and ovicidal {{effects of}} {{essential}} oil extracted from Ziziphora clinopodioides (Boiss.) (Lamiaceae) were tested on adults and eggs of Callosobruchus maculatus (Fab.). Oil concentrations of 9, 12. 5, 17. 6, 24. 5 and 34. 2 μl L - 1 air were tested on adults while concentrations of 3. 5, 5. 8, 9. 7, 16. 1 and 26. 7 μl L - 1 air were tested on eggs. Adults and eggs were exposed for 24, 48 and 72 h. After each exposure, insecticide effect was estimated by counting {{the number of}} dead adults of C. maculatus while ovicidal effect was estimated by {{counting the number of}} unhatched eggs. Results showed that the oil had high <b>fumigant</b> <b>action</b> against adults and eggs, the adults being more susceptible than the eggs. After 72 h of exposure to an oil concentration of 34. 2 μl L - 1 air, the adult mortality was 94. 65 % while the egg mortality was 61. 10 % for an oil concentration of 26. 7 μl L - 1 air. The lowest values after 72 h were observed on adults of C. maculatus (Fab.) (4. 01). The LC 50 amount for eggs at this time was 16. 98 μl L - 1 air. Progeny was reduced by 57. 76 % after a 72 h exposure of oil at a concentration of 34. 2 μl L - 1 air. Fumigant effects of this essential oil were considered to warrant further research into their potential for commercial use...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments to examine the mode of action and toxicity of three plant essential oils (thyme, manuka and pennyroyal) to the poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer), a serious ectoparasitic pest of laying hens. All three oils {{were found to be}} toxic to D. gallinae in laboratory tests with LC(50), LC(90) and LC(99) values below 0. 05, 0. 20 and 0. 30 mg/cm(3), respectively, suggesting that these products may make for effective acaricides against this pest. Further experiments demonstrated that when mites were exposed to only the vapour phase of the essential oil without contact with the oil itself, mortality was consistently higher in closed arenas than in arenas open to the surrounding environment, or in control arenas. This suggests that all three essential oils were toxic to D. gallinae by <b>fumigant</b> <b>action.</b> In addition, in an experiment where mites were allowed contact with the essential oil in either open or closed arenas, mortality was always reduced in the open arenas where this was comparable to control mortality for thyme and pennyroyal essential oil treatments. This supports the findings of the previous experiment and also suggests that, {{with the possible exception of}} manuka, the selected essential oils were not toxic to D. gallinae on contact. Statistical comparisons were made between the toxicity of the selected essential oils to D. gallinae in the current work and in a previous study conducted in the same laboratory. The results demonstrated considerable variation in LC(50), LC(90) and LC(99) values. Since both the essential oils and the mites were obtained from identical sources in the two studies, it is hypothesized that this variation resulted from the use of different 'batches' of essential oil, which could have varied in chemistry and hence acaricidal activity...|$|E
30|$|Some {{botanicals}} {{possess an}} insecticidal activity. They are generally less {{harmful to the}} environment, and their use avoids the development of insect resistance (Isman 2006). They are used as direct spray, soil amendments for plant parts, intercropping with main crop, grain protectants, and also as synergists (Prakash et al. 2008). There are many products that are safe as well as cost-effective that is why botanicals are considered extra efficient. For pest management, botanicals can be an attractive alternates to synthetic chemical insecticides because they pose little threat to human (Isman 2006). Azadirachta indica (neem) is a well-known plant species used for its insecticidal activity (Cruz-Estrada et al. 2013). It produces limonoid extracts with various insecticidal activities against more than 250 species of agricultural imporatnce (Morgan 2009). Additionally, it is known to show synergistic ability with some chemical or biological insecticides (Mohan et al. 2007). Eucalyptus leaves contain many terpenoid compounds like α- and β-pinene, 1, 8 -cineole (CIN), terpineol, and globulol (Lucia et al. 2012). These compounds have been described to have antimicrobial, antiviral, insecticidal, and antifungal activities, and even have been confirmed for contact and <b>fumigant</b> insecticidal <b>action</b> against some stored grain and other insect pests (Mann and Kaufman 2012).|$|R
