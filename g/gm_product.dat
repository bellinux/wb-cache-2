The objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the attitude of the Malaysian public toward GM foods (GM soybean and GM palm oil) and GM medicine (GM insulin). A survey was carried out using self-constructed multidimensional instrument measuring attitudes towards <b>GM</b> <b>products.</b> The respondents (n= 1017) were stratified according to stakeholders’ groups in the Klang Valley region. Results of the survey show that the overall attitude of the Malaysian stakeholders towards <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> was cautious. Although they acknowledged the presence of moderate perceived benefits associated with <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> surveyed and were moderately encouraging of them, they were also moderately concerned about the risks and moral aspects of the three <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> as well as moderately accepting the risks. Attitudes towards <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> among the stakeholders were found to vary not according to the type of all GM applications but rather depend on the intricate relationships between the attitudinal factors and the type of gene transfers involved.

40|$|We build a partial-equilibrium, two-country {{model to}} analyze some {{implications}} of the introduction of genetically modified (<b>GM)</b> <b>products.</b> In the model, innovators hold proprietary rights on the new technology, whereas farmers are (competitive) adopters; some consumers deem food produced from <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> to be inferior to traditional food; countries trade both traditional and GM products; countries can adopt regulations (such as mandatory labeling of <b>GM</b> <b>products)</b> that have direct trade implications; and, crucially, the mere introduction of GM crops affects the costs of non-GM food (because it makes it necessary to implement costly identity preservation). The analysis shows that, although agricultural biotechnology innovations {{have the potential to}} improve efficiency, some agents (consumers and/or producers that adopt the innovation) can actually be made worse off by the innovation, and indeed it is even possible that the costs induced by the innovation outweigh the efficiency gains. The study also illustrates the potential for protectionist policies that arise in the context of regulating <b>GM</b> <b>products.</b> In particular, mandatory labeling of <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> (as being implemented by the European Union) is unnecessary, inferior to a system of voluntary labeling, and has costly implications from the perspective of an exporting country that adopts <b>GM</b> <b>products.</b> But this costly labeling policy may actually benefit the importing country that implements the labeling requirement. biotechnology, food labeling, genetically modified products, identity preservation, innovations, intellectual property rights, international trade, market failure, monopoly, protectionism, regulation. ...|$|R

Despite {{the reluctance of}} their consumers, large western importers of maize, canola and soybeans, like Japan or the European Union have approved the imports {{of a number of}} key <b>GM</b> <b>products.</b> But with the acceleration in the release of new GM crop varieties in major commodity exporters (like the United States, Argentina, or Brazil), these and other importers are becoming concerned with delayed import authorizations and the increasing risk of temporary trade disruptions due to the adventitious presence of unapproved <b>GM</b> <b>products</b> conflicting with their zero percent tolerance for unapproved <b>GM</b> <b>products.</b> The consequence of such disruption is higher prices: importers either have to switch to less efficient GM suppliers or to non-GM suppliers to respond to their needs.
