The Tennessee Center for Policy Research (TCPR) has twice criticized Gore for electricity consumption in his Tennessee home. In February 2007, TCPR stated that its analysis of records from the Nashville Electric Service indicated that the Gore household uses [...] "20 times as much electricity as the average household nationwide." [...] In reporting on TCPR's claims, MSNBC's Countdown With Keith Olbermann noted that the house has twenty rooms and home offices and that the [...] "green power switch" [...] installed increased their <b>electric</b> <b>bill</b> while decreasing overall carbon pollution. Philosopher A. C. Grayling also defended Al Gore, arguing that Gore's personal lifestyle does nothing to impugn his message and that Gore's critics have committed the ad hominem fallacy.|$|E

2500|$|An {{innovative}} {{financing arrangement}} pioneered in Berkeley, California, and Palm Springs, lends {{money to a}} homeowner for a solar system, to be repaid via an additional tax assessment on the property for 20 years. [...] This allows installation {{of the solar system}} at [...] "relatively little up-front cost to the property owner." [...] Now known as PACE, for Property Assessed Clean Energy, it is available in 28 states. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have objected to the repayment of solar loans being senior to mortgage loans, and some states have relegated PACE loans to junior loans. HR 2599 was introduced to prevent interference with the PACE program by other lenders. The principle feature of the program is that the balance of the loan is transferred to the new owners in the event the property is sold, and the loan is paid for entirely through <b>electric</b> <b>bill</b> savings. Unlike a mortgage loan, no funds are transferred when the property is sold - only the repayment obligation is transferred.|$|E
