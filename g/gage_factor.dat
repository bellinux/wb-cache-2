The resistance was measured {{as a function}} of uniaxial loading under constant current conditions. The piezoresistive <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> was found to be in the range of 600 – 1700 at an applied stress of 1 MPa. The <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> depends on both the stress and temperature. The piezoresistivity was measured up to 1000 ◦C, demonstrating the viability of PDCs as piezoresistive materials at high temperatures. The Arrhenius dependence of the <b>gage</b> <b>factor,</b> ψ, gives the following expression for its temperature dependence at 1 MPa: ψ = 44 exp(28, 000 / 8. 31 T), where T is in Kelvin. The extrapolated values of the <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> yield a value of 322 at 1400 ◦C, and 287 at 1500 ◦C (at an applied stress of 1 MPa).

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are very}} attractive materials owing to its large <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> as a piezoresistive element. Thus, CNTs have high potential abilities as a strain gage for various sensor applications. However, batch-fabrication process for integrating CNTs is generally difficult because CNTs are flexible and easily deformed during microfabrication process, in addition adhesion force to substrate is very weak. In this paper, we report the batch-fabrication process of integration of carbon nanotubes piezoresistive elements into microstructures based on {{chemical vapour deposition}} of carbon nanotubes, and deposition of SiO 2 onto the CNTs. It {{has been reported that}} semiconductive CNTs exhibit a <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> of over 1000 [1, 2], also metallic CNTs exhibits a <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> of ~ 200 [3].

In order to demonstrate the integration of CNTs into microstructure, a cantilevered structure shown in Fig. 1 is fabricated in this research. At the support part of the freely-suspended SiO 2 cantilever, the strain gage of CNTs, which are buried into SiO 2, is formed.

40|$|Jump Starting Technologies, Patent Issues, & Translational Medicine Poster SessionAging {{brings about}} {{dramatic}} changes in the skeleton and other organ systems. Major skeletal diseases associated with aging include osteoporosis and attendant fractures (hip, spine and wrist or Collies) and osteoarthritis and its resulting need for various joint replacements. The prosthetic joint market in the United Sates is between $ 4 - 5 billion annually and estimates have suggested that this number will increase by upwards of 10 % annually as our population continues to age. The average life expectancy of hip and knee replacements is around 10 years, after which replacement of the prosthetic device becomes highly likely. A strain gage sensor that could be incorporated into the prosthetic implant represents a significant advance in terms of assessing the stability of the implant and potentially enables the surgeon to intervene preemptively before failure actually occurs. This poster outlines the fabrication of printable strain gage sensors for use in prosthetic implants and bone biology studies. The authors have completed the preliminary and feasibility studies and are looking for a partner to fund the project. The proposed strain gages are fabricated employing desktop inkjet printers and can be printed on flexible substrates. Special inks based on carbon nanotubes (CNT) and copper nanoparticles are prepared and used in the printing process. The proposed strain gage sensors have several advantages over the conventional metallic alloy gages currently used in biomedical studies. First, CNT-based strain sensors have <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> of up to 25. In contrast, metallic <b>gages</b> have <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> of 1. 2. The improved <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> translate into better sensor sensitivity and correspondingly into the detection of smaller strain variations. The commercially available metallic gages have a relatively large size. In contrast, the proposed strain sensors can be made very small due to the fine resolution of inkjet printers and can be custom shaped in different geometries. Furthermore, the sensors can be arranged in arrays enabling the measurement of strain at different points along the bone or the prosthetic implant. Finally, CNT-based strain sensors have better biocompatibility when compared to the metallic gages. Their biocompatibility has been demonstrated in several studies. The estimated cost of chemicals and reagents to prepare enough ink to fill several cartridges is around $ 780. Equipment and lab facilities are available at UMKC. Carbon nanotubes are commercially available from NanoLab Inc. Copper nanoparticles and other chemicals can be acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.

A layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication procedure is detailed for the manufacture of free-standing thin films defined by interdigitated phase homogeneity and high strength.

Results of strain tests using sensors protected using this approach are presented and the implications are discussed.

In this study, the strain and damage sensing possible application of carbon fiber reinforced alkali activated slag pastes has been evaluated. Cement pastes with 0, 0. 29 and 0. 58 vol % carbon fiber addition were prepared. Both carbon fiber dosages showed sensing properties. For strain sensing, function <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> of up to 661 were calculated for compressive cycles. Furthermore, all composites with carbon fibers suffered a sudden increase in their resistivity when internal damages began, prior to any external signal of damage.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{structures}} and components are highly susceptible to damage due to delamination, matrix cracking, inter-laminar fracture, and debonding, {{all of which}} have potential to cause catastrophic structural failure. While numerous sensing technologies have been developed and embedded in FRP composites for monitoring strain, they serve as defects and can promote damage formation and propagation. Thus, in this study, an alternative technique is proposed for in situ strain monitoring of FRP composites via layer-by-layer multi-walled carbon nanotube-polyelectrolyte thin films deposited directly upon glass fiber weaves. To date, these carbon nanotube-based thin films have been validated for their piezoresistivity.

40|$|Organoisocyanide {{polymers}} {{have been}} studied intensively since the 1960 s. It has been assumed that polyisocyanides exist as a tightly wound helix and this is always present in these polymers. However, our {{results indicate that the}} N-phenyl-polyiminomethylene (N-φ-PIM) is not a purely helical polymer in solution. N-φ-PIM is fairly soluble in THF, CH 2 Cl 2 and CCl 4 but aggregation and precipitation occur in solution. UV-Vis spectra were obtained to probe the kinetics of the aggregation process in solution. Our results are best interpreted by assuming that N-φ-PIM undergoes an uncoiling of the rigid rod helix in solution. Possible mechanisms of aggregation are also discussed in this study. ^ Conventional metal strain gages are inexpensive but the reproducibility is not good at high strains and they are not sensitive at very low strain. Polymer sensors have the advantages of being cheap, easily manipulated and tunable by synthesis. It has been found that the optical band gap shifts with the application of strain in wide band gap semiconductors. Polymers are also wide band gap materials, so polymers should also respond optically to applied strain. A simple one-dimensional model was introduced to illustrate how polymers might respond to applied strain. The four point flexure method was employed for measuring strain optically. A polyaniline/polyelectrolyte complex was used in our study because polyaniline has a chromophore which fits our model. Our results demonstrated that polymer thin films could be used to monitor strain optically and the <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> of polymer sensors are much bigger than that of metals. The short term reproducibility is good, however the environmental sensitivity of the polyaniline/polyelectrolyte complex remains a minor problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Flexible microwires {{fabricated}} from conducting polymers have a {{wide range}} of potential applications, including smart textiles that incorporate sensing, actuation, and data processing. The development of garments that integrate these functionalities over wide areas (i. e. the human body) requires the production of long, highly conductive, and mechanically robust fibers or microwires. This thesis describes the development of a microwire slicing instrument capable of producing conducting polymer wires with widths as small as a few micrometers and lengths ranging from tens of millimeters to meters. To ensure high conductivity and robustness, the wires are sliced from thin polypyrrole films electrodeposited onto a glassy carbon crucible. Extensive testing was conducted to determine the optimal cutting parameters for producing long, fine wires with cleanly cut edges. This versatile fabrication process has been used to produce free-standing microwires with cross-sections of 2 [micro]m x 3 [micro]m, 20 [micro]m x 20 [micro]m, and 100 [micro]m x 20 [micro]m with lengths of 15 mm, 460 mm, and 1, 200 mm, respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two distinct parts: An Optical Waveguide Strain Sensor comprises Part 1, and An Electrochemical Oxygen Sensor comprises Part 2. ^ The optical waveguide strain sensor examined in this work consists of a polyimide coated fused silica capillary tube {{which serves as a}} waveguide in which an optical signal is attenuated in an amount proportional to applied bending strain. The capillary is incorporated into an optical fiber fink, making possible continuous monitoring and damage assessment of structures such as bridges and buildings. By applying thin films to the surfaces of the waveguide, the strain gage can be optimized for specific strain ranges. This optical strain sensor exhibits advantages in comparison to commercially available metal foil (resistance) strain <b>gages,</b> including <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> 100 times larger and temperature insensitivity for operating temperatures ranging from – 25 °C to + 51 °C. ^ The electrochemical oxygen sensor consists of a glassy carbon (GC) electrode coated with either of two electrocatalytic polymer films: poly(1, 2 -phenylenediamine) (PPD) or poly(2, 3 -diaminophenazine) (PDAP). Either polymer film catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide in acidic aqueous media. In addition, relative to bare GC, the polymer films increase cathodic peak current by a factor of 3, shift the cathodic peak potential positively by 300 mV, and improve cathodic peak shape. Visible reflectance spectra reveal structural differences reveals between the two films, despite the fact that both are similar in their electrocatalytic behavior. Although either 1, 2 -phenylenediamine (PD) or 2, 3 -diminophenazine (DAP) may be electropolymerized onto GC for subsequent use in oxygen determination, DAP is preferred for use because it is more stable in solution and its spectrum exhibits a higher degree of conjugation. The in situ electropolymerization of DAP results in a polymer coating which is strongly adherent, stable, suitable for prolonged use, and highly effective in the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction. ...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical agents, {{including}} {{bacteria and}} toxins, are potentially dangerous and {{responsible for a}} wide variety of diseases. Reliable detection and characterization of small samples is necessary in order to reduce and eliminate their harmful consequences. Microcantilever sensors offer a potential alternative to the state of the art due to their small size, fast response time, and the ability to operate in air and liquid environments. At present, there are several technology limitations that inhibit application of microcantilever to biochemical detection and analysis, including difficulties in conducting temperature-sensitive experiments, material inadequacy resulting in insufficient cell capture, and poor selectivity of multiple analytes. This work aims to address several of these issues by introducing microcantilevers having integrated thermal functionality and by introducing nanocrystalline diamond as new material for microcantilevers. Microcantilevers are designed, fabricated, characterized, and used for capture and detection of cells and bacteria. The first microcantilever type described in this work is a silicon cantilever having highly uniform in-plane temperature distribution. The goal is to have 100 μm square uniformly heated area that can be used for thermal characterization of films as well as to conduct chemical reactions with small amounts of material. Fabricated cantilevers can reach above 300 C while maintaining temperature uniformity of 2 − 4 %. This is an improvement of over one order of magnitude over currently available cantilevers. The second microcantilever type is a doped single crystal silicon cantilever having a thin coating of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD). The primary application of such a device is in biological testing, where diamond acts as a stable, electrically isolated reaction surface while silicon layer provides controlled heating with minimum variations in temperature. This work shows that composite cantilevers of this kind are an effective platform for temperature-sensitive biological experiments, such as heat lysing and polymerase chain reaction. The rapid heat-transfer of Si-UNCD cantilever compromised the membrane of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast and lysed the cell nucleus within 30 seconds. Bacteria cells, Listeria monocytogenes V 7, were shown to be captured with biotinylated heat-shock protein on UNCD surface and 90 % of all viable cells exhibit membrane porosity due to high heat in 15 seconds. Lastly, a sensor made solely from UNCD diamond is fabricated with the intention of being used to detect the presence of biological species by means of an integrated piezoresistor or through frequency change monitoring. Since UNCD diamond has not been previously used in piezoresistive applications, temperature-denpendent piezoresistive coefficients and <b>gage</b> <b>factors</b> are determined first. The doped UNCD exhibits a significant piezoresistive effect with gauge factor of 7. 53 ± 0. 32 and a piezoresistive coefficient of 8. 12 × 10 ^− 12 Pa^− 1 at room temperature. The piezoresistive properties of UNCD are constant over the temperature range of 25 − 200 C. 300 μm long cantilevers have the highest sensitivity of 0. 186 m-Ohm/Ohm per μm of cantilever end deflection, which is approximately half that of similarly sized silicon cantilevers. UNCD cantilever arrays were fabricated consisting of four sixteen-cantilever arrays of length 20 – 90 μm in addition to an eight-cantilever array of length 120 μm. Laser doppler vibrometry (LDV) measured the cantilever resonant frequency, which ranged as 218 kHz− 5. 14 MHz in air and 73 kHz− 3. 68 MHz in water. The quality factor of the cantilever was 47 − 151 in air and 18 − 45 in water. The ability to measure frequencies of the cantilever arrays opens the possibility for detection of individual bacteria by monitoring frequency shift after cell capture...|$|R

The weighted least squares fit is specifically designed to increase the influence of single-component loadings during the regression analysis. The weighted least squares fit also reduces the impact of calibration load schedule asymmetries on the predicted primary sensitivities of the balance <b>gages.</b> A weighting <b>factor</b> between zero and one is assigned to each calibration data point that depends on a simple count of its intentionally loaded load components or gages. The greater the number of a data point's intentionally loaded load components or gages is, the smaller its weighting factor becomes. The proposed approach is applicable to both the Iterative and Non-Iterative Methods that are used {{for the analysis of}} strain-gage balance calibration data in the aerospace testing community. The Iterative Method uses a reasonable estimate of the tare corrected load set as input for the determination of the weighting factors.

Machine calibration data of a six-component force balance is used to illustrate benefits of the proposed weighted least squares fit. In addition, a detailed derivation of the PRESS residuals associated with a weighted least squares fit is given in the appendices of the paper as this information could not be found in the literature.

Thin film semiconducting oxides and nanocomposites based on indium tin oxide (ITO) and other semiconductors are being developed as strain sensors, thermoelectric devices and temperature sensors for high temperature aerospace applications.

The correlations obtained between deformation and electrical resistance show the suitability of the rods to be used as sensors. The fractional resistance change versus strain plots show that the <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> increases with decreasing carbon fiber content...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are recently used in civil applications, in strengthening of masonry and concrete structures. They offer many advantages, {{in comparison with}} traditional techniques, mainly related to the favourable strength to weight ratio. Besides, monitoring the structure during its lifetime is very important, in order to detect possible anomalous situations. The innovative and original multifunctional textile, described in this work, is conceived to perform both these functions: thanks to a tube woven inside the fabric during manufacturing process, a fibre optical sensor can be inserted successively inside this tube, directly on the reinforced structure, allowing the structural health monitoring. Tensile tests on composite material performed with the textile allowed the mechanical characterization and {{the identification of the}} <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> of the embedded sensor. Moreover, flexural tests, carried out on small scale samples reinforced with the textile, allowed to test the measuring performance of the textile in possible real applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Significant strain-gage errors {{may exist}} in {{measurements}} acquired in transient thermal environments if conventional correction methods are applied. Conventional correction theory was modified {{and a new}} experimental method was developed to correct indicated strain data for errors created in radiant heating environments ranging from 0. 6 C/sec (1 F/sec) to over 56 C/sec (100 F/sec). In some cases the new and conventional methods differed {{by as much as}} 30 percent. Experimental and analytical results were compared to demonstrate the new technique. For heating conditions greater than 6 C/sec (10 F/sec), the indicated strain data corrected with the developed technique compared much better to analysis than the same data corrected with the conventional technique.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{artificial}} prosthetic replacements {{depends on the}} fixation of the artificial prosthetic component after being implanted in the thighbone. This work shows a smart prosthesis based on highly sensitive silicon thin-film piezoresistive sensors attached to a hip prosthesis. The performance of the sensors for this application is studied and compared to commercial strain gauge sensors. Mechanical stress-strain experiments were performed in compressive mode, during 10, 000 cycles and data was acquired at mechanical vibration frequencies of 0. 5 Hz, 1 Hz and 5 Hz, and sent to a computer {{by means of a}} wireless link. The results show that there is a decrease in sensitivity of the thin-film silicon piezoresistive (n-type nanocrystalline Si) sensors when they are attached to the prosthesis, however this decrease does not compromise its monitoring performance. The sensitivity, compared to that of commercial strain gauges, is much larger due to their higher gauge factor (- 23. 5), when compared to the <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> of commercial sensors (2) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an innovative carbon nanotube-based non-woven composite sensor that can be tailored for strain sensing properties and potentially offers a reliable and cost-effective sensing option for structural health monitoring (SHM). This novel strain sensor is fabricated using a readily scalable process of coating Carbon nanotubes (CNT) onto a nonwoven carrier fabric to form an electrically-isotropic conductive network. Epoxy is then infused into the CNT-modified fabric to form a free-standing nanocomposite strain sensor. By measuring the changes in the electrical properties of the sensing composite the deformation can be measured in real-time. The sensors are repeatable and linear up to 0. 4 % strain. Highest elastic strain gage factors of 1. 9 and 4. 0 have been achieved in the longitudinal and transverse direction, respectively. Although the longitudinal <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> of the newly formed nanocomposite sensor is close to some metallic foil strain gages, the proposed sensing methodology offers spatial coverage, manufacturing customizability, distributed sensing capability as well as transverse sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Sputtered {{thin-film}} dynamic strain gages of 2 millimeter (0. 08 in) {{gage length}} and 10 micrometer (0. 0004 in) thickness were fabricated on turbojet engine blades and {{tested in a}} simulated compressor environment. Four designs were developed, two for service to 600 K (600 F) and two for service to 900 K (1200 F). The program included a detailed study of guidelines for formulating strain-gage alloys to achieve superior dynamic and static gage performance. The tests included <b>gage</b> <b>factor,</b> fatigue, temperature cycling, spin to 100, 000 G, and erosion. Since the installations are 30 times thinner than conventional wire strain gage installations, and any alteration of the aerodynamic, thermal, or structural performance of the blade is correspondingly reduced, dynamic strain measurement accuracy higher than that attained with conventional gages is expected. The low profile and good adherence of the thin film elements is expected to result in improved durability over conventional gage elements in engine tests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{prototyping}} {{of a new}} piezoresistive microforce sensor is presented. An {{original design}} taking advantage on both mechanical and bulk piezoresistive properties of silicon is presented and enables to easily fabricate a very small, large range, high sensitivity with high integration potential sensor. The sensor is made of two silicon strain gages for which widespread and known microfabrication processes are used. The strain gages present a high <b>gage</b> <b>factor</b> which allow a good sensitivity of this force sensor. The dimensions of this sensor are 700 mm in length, 100 mm in width and 12 mm in thickness. These dimensions make its use convenient with many microscale applications notably its integration in a microgripper. The fabricated sensor is calibrated using an industrial force sensor. The design, microfabrication process, and performances of the fabricated piezoresistive force sensor are innovative thanks to its resolution of 100 nN and its measurement range of 2 mN. This force sensor presents also a high signal to noise ratio, typically 50 dB when a 2 mN force is applied {{at the tip of}} the force sensor...|$|E
