50|$|Negative cutting (also {{known as}} {{negative}} matching and negative conforming) {{is the process}} of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the film editor. Original camera negative (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a film splicer and <b>film</b> <b>cement.</b> Negative cutting is part of the post-production process and occurs after editing and prior to striking internegatives and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process. Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on keykode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} verify {{marginal}} fit {{and the effect}} of <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness standardization on retention of provisional crowns made with prefabricated acrylic cylinders on abutments, using two temporary luting agents subjected or not to mechanical cycling. Provisional crowns were made from bis-acryl (Luxatemp Fluorescence) or methyl methacrylate (Duralay) resins on acrylic cylinders and marginal fit and <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness were evaluated. For retention evaluation, crowns were cemented with two temporary luting agents: non-eugenol zinc oxide (Tempbond NE) or calcium hydroxide-based (Hydcal) cements and subjected to tensile strength in a universal testing machine. After cleaning, debonded crowns were cemented again, subjected to mechanical cycling and retention was reassessed. The results of marginal fit and <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness were analyzed by Student's t-test while retention of cements before and after mechanical cycling was analyzed using a mixed linear model. Methyl methacrylate crowns presented greater marginal misfit (p= 0. 001) and occlusal <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness (p= 0. 003) than the bis-acryl ones. No difference was observed at axial <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness (p= 0. 606). Resins (p= 0. 281) did not affect crown retention, but luting agents (p= 0. 029) and mechanical cycling (p= 0. 027) showed significant effects. The only significant interaction was mechanical cycling*luting agents, which means that luting agents were differently affected by mechanical cycling (p= 0. 002). In conclusion, the results showed that bis-acryl resin associated to calcium-hydroxide luting agent provided the best retention and lower cement thickness...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the dangers}} of the nitrate film base being known {{practically}} since its development, it was used in virtually all major motion pictures prior to 1952, when Kodak completed a four-year conversion program to the sole manufacturing of acetate base film stocks. Kodak began working with acetate [...] "safety film" [...] as early as 1909, and started selling it in 1910 for 22 mm film. Acetate has always been used with 8 mm and 16 mm formats, as they were originally created for amateur home movie usage, and generally was used for most sub-35 mm formats to minimize risk to the general public. (Several formats, such as 17.5 mm, which were often re-slit from 35 mm, were nitrate, however. One of Kodak's reasons for choosing 16 mm instead of 17.5 mm for a standard amateur format width was specifically to prevent nitrate re-slits from being used in home movies.) All motion picture camera negatives are now shot on acetate film because it is safer than nitrate but not as strong as polyester bases, which may damage the camera rather than the film should a jam occur. Acetate can also be spliced with <b>film</b> <b>cement,</b> while polyester can only be spliced with tape or an ultrasonic splicer, so polyester would be hard to edit. Acetate film does not burn under intense heat, but rather melts, causing a bubbling burn-out effect - this can be seen simulated in films such as Persona (1966) or Velvet Goldmine, or, if one is unlucky, in real life during a film screening when a frame becomes stuck in the projector's film gate. Acetate films are also subject to degradation over time. With exposure to heat, moisture or acids the acetyl groups which are attached to long chains of cellulose which form the film base are broken from their molecular bonds and free acetic acid is released with a characteristic smell of vinegar. This is known as vinegar syndrome. As the degradation progresses the film base becomes brittle and shrinks.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Antonio Margheriti is an Italian film {{director}} {{who has not}} been the recipient of much academic or critical reassessment. Despite being a director for forty years, single handedly creating Italy's sci-fi genre, and being the first Italian director to make films critical of the Vietnam War, his contributions to Italian film canon are unrecognized. This thesis attempts to remedy this by examining one of his films, Castle of Blood, in order to set the foundation for future academic work on reassessing not only Antonio Margheriti, but other Italian genre directors as well. This thesis uses the vernacular film theory instead of the traditional auteur theory when analyzing Margheriti and Castle of Blood. The conclusions drawn from the thesis is that Castle of Blood is an important film in bridging the sexuality gap in Italy during the 1960 s, despite a period of influence from the Christian Democratic Party who regulated much of the cinema. The effects of Castle of Blood of challenging sexual notions in Italian <b>film</b> <b>cement</b> Margheriti as an important director and worthy of additional reconsideration...|$|E

40|$|Brief {{introduction}} to the problem: the growing awareness of climate change and its link to carbon dioxide emissions have caused concerns in the community. A substantial amount of carbon dioxide emitted {{is due to the}} energy consumed by residential households. Heating/cooling of a residential house consumes {{a large proportion of the}} total household energy. Purpose: This paper explores the concept by comparing thermal efficiency of the four most common external wall structures, with varying amounts of insulation added in the context of Sydney, Australia. Design/methodology/approach: Cost and thermal analysis for each wall type are calculated. Life cycle cost saving and payback period are then evaluated. Findings: It is found that up to 95. 7 % cost saving can be achieved in heating/cooling in comparing the use of insulated wall systems and air <b>film.</b> <b>Cement</b> sheet wall system is found to be the most cost effective wall system for insulation with minimum 50 % of cost saving can be achieved. The results also identify substantial energy cost required for heating/cooling a house without insulation when the climate gets extreme. The payback period for the installation of the insulated wall systems can be achieved in 4. 98 years for normal climate condition or 2. 58 years for extreme climate condition. Practical implications: The community is currently at great risk of being unable to deal with climate change issue as not clear the effective use of insulated wall systems. This paper can help provide insight and suggestions for residential households in tackling global warming issue...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness of a zinc phosphate or a resin cement on retention of untreated and pretreated root canal posts. Prefabricated zirconia posts (CosmoPost: 1. 4 mm) and two types of luting cements (a zinc phosphate cement [DeTrey Zinc] and a self-etch adhesive resin cement [Panavia F 2. 0]) were used. After removal of the crowns of 360 extracted premolars, canines, or incisors, the root canals were prepared with a parallel-sided drill system to three different final diameters. Half the posts did not receive any pretreatment. The other half received tribochemical silicate coating according to the manufacturer's instructions. Posts were then luted in the prepared root canals (n= 30 per group). Following water storage at 37 °C for seven days, retention of the posts was determined by the pull-out method. Irrespective of the luting cement, pretreatment with tribochemical silicate coating significantly increased retention of the posts. Increased <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness resulted in decreased retention of untreated posts and of pretreated posts luted with zinc phosphate <b>cement.</b> Increased <b>cement</b> <b>film</b> thickness had no influence on retention of pretreated posts luted with resin cement.
