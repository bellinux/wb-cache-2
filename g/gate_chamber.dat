An FEM model of the columnar reversing gate was built, and the natural vibration properties of the gate were analyzed. Based on the Westergaard added mass method, the added mass caused by the fluid-structure coupling motion was taken into account, {{and the effects of}} the coupling interaction were discussed. The results show that the size of the small gates meets the demand for discharge capacity, the current in the <b>gate</b> <b>chamber</b> is quite turbulent, the trunnion and arms are obviously impacted by flow, and the effects of water on vibration characteristics are remarkable.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{operation of}} a lock with separate water- saving basins and introduction of water through the chamber bottom, adopted as the reference solution during the preliminary design studies of the Seine-Nord Europe Canal, has been studied using numerical and physical models. These studies were used to size the chamber water supply system and define the most suitable design for the <b>gate</b> <b>chamber</b> controlling flows between the water- saving basins and the lock chamber. The 1 : 25 scale model built for the lock with the largest drop height (30 m) enabled the numerical simulation results to be validated and fine-tuned, and certain operating parameters to be optimised. The phenomenon of surge waves in the reaches, related to the rapid filling and emptying of large locks (in {{spite of the fact}} that most of this water volume is exchanged between the chamber and the water-saving basins in a closed circuit) means that special measures must be taken to maintain navigation conditions in the canal. Of the possible solutions, the one proposed at this stage of the project consists, firstly, in limiting the discharges exchanged between the chamber and the canal, which is a means of controlling the initial surge wave but restricts possibilities for speeding up lockage, and secondly, in creating damping basins along the reaches, preferably alongside the locks, in order to reduce the amplitude of the resulting waves in the canal...|$|E

Hyde, Winchester MON 5 TH April- MON. 3 I MAY 2010 Hyde Abbey Chamber {{is one of the}} last remains of the Hyde Abbey and is dated approximately 1, 100. I was invited for this project to make a site specific painting that was to situated amongst this historic situation. The project has taken over a year to execute and will be running to the end of may. ‘Statement “From the outset of this project, I wanted to set up a contrast between my work and the history and architecture of Hyde Abbey <b>Gate</b> <b>Chamber.</b> I did not wish to construct a narrative that illustrates the building’s history. “The building encloses an almost cubic space embedded with history, both past and contemporary; the graffiti, the contextual panels all adding to the character of this ancient site. My work attempts to make a comparison between the historical and the present. One of my central concerns is to map and integrate different spaces and ideas: a landscape is contrasted with a molecular system, which is in turn compared with a diagrammatic black hole. The fusing together of these spaces is involved in the art of imagining. I attempt to use a mixture of systems, the subjective and the distant, the personal and the objective, the autobiographical and the scientific. “For me, this project represents the placing of my work within the historic and the actual, and attempts to extend and embrace the question of memory, whether it is public or private, secular or sacred, or historic and imaginary. ” Stephen Cooper, April 2010 <br/...|$|E
40|$|The lock {{complex at}} Terneuzen {{is the main}} {{entrance}} for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The {{construction of a new}} large lock at the lock complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between the existing locks. The ground level is situated at NAP + 6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP - 2. 85 meter. The new lock will have larger dimensions than the current locks. It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must {{be able to use the}} lock tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new lock head. (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete lock head including the <b>gate</b> <b>chamber</b> and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the <b>gate</b> <b>chamber.</b> Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the lock head has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the lock head, is the best conceivable option.
