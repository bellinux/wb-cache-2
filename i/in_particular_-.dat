25|$|In an {{incredible}} finish to the knock-out quarter-final between Surrey Lions and Warwickshire Bears, the match was tied, so the players had {{to resort to}} a bowl-off - cricket's version of a penalty shootout, in which five players have two attempts at bowling at unguarded stumps, and if the stumps fall down, that was one point for their team. Surrey opened the batting in this match at The Oval, having been put in to bat by the Bears' captain Nick Knight. It was a shaky effort, often interrupted by wickets, and part-timer Jonathan Trott snared two wickets for 19 - admittedly tail-enders Ian Salisbury and Tim Murtagh. Mark Ramprakash, however, hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 34 to guide Surrey to 149 for 8, well below a par score. Warwickshire's innings then began under heavy cloud cover that assisted the Surrey swing bowlers. After Neil Carter went first ball, Warwickshire struggled in the rain, and the bad weather eventually stopped play just before five overs was played - so that, if the players couldn't return, the match would be declared a no-result. However, the rain gave way reasonably quickly, and quick hitting from Trevor Penney <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>-</b> who made 20 off 12 balls before being caught off a ball from Rikki Clarke closed down the deficit.|$|E

25|$|One of his {{greatest}} works from this period {{is a series of}} murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, he painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Along the opposite wall he painted what he called the “Seven Climates,” in the sense of “a belt of the earth’s surface contained between two given parallels of latitude.” The Gulf Coast—Ocean Springs <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>-</b> is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Another, smaller mural, painted around the same time but discovered only after his death on the wooden walls of a padlocked room in his cottage at Shearwater, is inspired by Psalm 104. It is a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the 'Walter Anderson Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|A {{housing crisis}} {{arose in the}} town {{at the end of}} the Second World War. New {{residential}} and private housing estates to the north-west, multi-storey flats and the redevelopment of areas such as Sinclairtown and Linktown occurred between the 1950s and 1960s. Several primary schools such as Valley, Fair Isle, Dunearn and Torbain were also built to serve these new estates (with Capshard being a latter addition in the early 1970s). Provision was given to new junior secondaries (Templehall and Balwearie); a new Catholic secondary (St Andrews) and the re-location of Kirkcaldy High School to Pathhead muir on the north side of the town. During the middle of the 1950s, construction began of a new hospital - on the site of the Fever hospital and sanatorium - to replace the cramped facilities of the cottage hospital situated to the east of the town. The late 1950s saw a new bus station open on a site north of the town centre to relieve the existing one on The Promenade (which continued to deal only with country routes until this was phased out in 1980). There was speculation that the town could grow around the 55,000 to 60,000 mark by 1970. This never materialised when the decline of linoleum in the mid-1960s - with the closure of the linoleum firm, Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd, shocking the town <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>-</b> saw the population of the town fall. To try to combat this, deep mining was commissioned at Seafield in 1954 by the National Coal Board to help reduce the impact of job losses, it later closed in 1988, after a tug of war between the National Union of Mineworkers and the Conservative Government. Kirkcaldy harbour, which had once been vital to the town’s well being, suffered its own fate when it was closed permanently in 1992 to main traffic.|$|E

[...] In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself [...] "pro-heterosexual" [...] and blamed this attitude on [...] "bad experiences" [...] with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father.

500|$|Arulpragasam {{was born}} on 18 July 1975, in Hounslow, West London, to Arul Pragasam, an engineer, writer and activist, and his wife, Kala, a seamstress.

Her family went into hiding from the Sri Lankan army, and Arulpragasam had little contact with her father during this period. She has described her family as living in [...] "big-time" [...] poverty during her childhood but also recalls some of her happiest memories from growing up in Jaffna. Maya attended Catholic convent schools such as the Holy Family Convent, Jaffna where she developed her art skills – painting <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>–</b> to work her way up her class. During the civil war, soldiers would put guns through holes in the windows and shoot at the school, what she notes as [...] "bullying exploitation." [...] Her classmates were trained to dive under the table or run next door to English-language schools that, according to her, [...] "wouldn’t get shot." [...] Arulpragasam lived on a road alongside much of her extended family and played inside temples and churches in the town.|$|E
500|$|Tyler and {{his allies}} had, since 1843, devised and {{encouraged}} national propaganda promoting Texas annexation, which understated Southern slaveholder's aspirations regarding the future of Texas. Instead, Tyler chose to portray the annexation of Texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to {{the nation as a}} whole. The further introduction of slavery into the vast expanses of Texas and beyond, they argued, would [...] "diffuse" [...] rather than concentrate slavery regionally, ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor. This theory was yoked to the growing enthusiasm among Americans for Manifest Destiny, a desire to see the social, economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across the continent. Moreover, Tyler declared that national security was at stake: If foreign powers – Great Britain <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>–</b> were to gain influence in Texas, it would be reduced to a British cotton-producing reserve and a base to exert geostrategic influence over North America. Texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery, inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between American free-soil and slave-soil interests. The appointment of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights reputation – which some believed was [...] "synonymous with slavery" [...] – threatened to cast doubt on Tyler's carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist. Tyler, though ambivalent, felt obliged to enlist Calhoun as Secretary of State, because Tyler's closest confidantes had, in haste, offered the position to the South Carolinian statesmen {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Princeton disaster. Calhoun would be confirmed by Congress by unanimous vote.|$|E
