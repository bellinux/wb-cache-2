5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear has <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> {{the making of}} this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error <b>went</b> <b>into</b> {{banishment}}. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person <b>went</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but the sages said that the person did <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person <b>went</b> <b>into</b> banishment, but the sages said that the person did not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> banishment.|$|R

The encounter was confrontational: Iorga decided to cut out entire passages where, he argued, the author had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> too much detail. The intervention was unwittingly destructive, as part of the documents cited by Filitti, and only by him, have since been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in its tracks.|$|E
5|$|Quality {{control and}} {{standards}} were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By {{the rise of}} consumerism in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> steep decline from Swiss competition.|$|E

5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a}} major {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks {{led to the development}} of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.|$|E
