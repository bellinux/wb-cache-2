Sex offenders, who may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners who require close psychiatric or medical supervision, are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian</b> is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted <b>in</b> <b>Norwegian.</b>|$|E

This thesis seeks to propose ways of reducing overruns in the IT-industry, through investigating the use of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> IT-industry and the role of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> educational system. An in-depth study of the use of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> IT-industry is conducted. In this study 18 companies and 50 projects are studied. In addition, three in-depth studies of teaching of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> educational system are conducted. A total of 28 schools are studied. Results from these studies suggest that there is plenty of room for improvement both in the use of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> IT-industry and within teaching of estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> educational system. <b>In</b> some, but far from all, of the software engineering courses available, an introduction to estimation is offered. In order to impose a positive effect on estimation <b>in</b> the <b>Norwegian</b> IT-industry, a greater focus on the teaching of estimation is suggested. This applies to the Norwegian educational system {{as well as to the}} <b>Norwegian</b> IT-industry. <b>In</b> this thesis several ideas on how to improve the teaching of estimation is proposed...|$|R
