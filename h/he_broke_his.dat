5|$|<b>He</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> nose during {{training}} camp after {{engaging in a}} pickup game. The injury required surgery and he needed to wear a mask.

During his rookie season, he received multiple assignments to the Grand Rapids Drive, the Pistons' D-League affiliate.|$|E

5|$|Nash's {{performance}} in junior cricket led Victorian district cricket club Fitzroy to sign {{him for the}} 1927/28 season. Nash made his first grade debut for Fitzroy as a seventeen-year-old and spent {{two and a half}} seasons at Fitzroy, earning plaudits for his performances and, until <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> wrist in a fielding mishap, there were suggestions that he was close to Victorian selection.|$|E

5|$|Nevin in 2002 played first base, {{which was}} {{considered}} his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons.

Three games after returning from the elbow injury, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks.

5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt {{a position as}} his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead.

Italy reached the final of the tournament, losing once again to France.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons, however, Hamels {{suffered}} through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly.

Subsequently, he was shut down {{for the remainder of the}} season with back spasms.|$|E
5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E

Playing with the club during the subsequent pre-season, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> right hand during a fight with Hartford Whalers forward Brendan Shanahan. The injury caused him to miss the first 11 games of the season. After recovering, he scored his first career NHL goal against the Whalers on December 2, 1995, a game-winner in a 5–3 victory. He finished his rookie season with 10 goals and 21 points over 70 games.

He was named the starting quarterback on the school's football team his senior year, but <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> foot {{in the second game}} of the season.

Currently, Hacker lives in Corsicana, Texas, with his wife, Christine, whom he married in November 2008. He is a Dallas Cowboys fan. Two of his hobbies are fishing and pool.|$|E
5|$|He fell badly out {{of shape}} before the 1993–94 season and was told by manager Dino Zoff to lose two stone (13kg) {{by the start of}} the {{campaign}} else he would lose his first team place. Gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat. He kept his place in the team and captained the club against US Cremonese when regular captain Roberto Cravero was substituted. However, in April <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>his</b> leg in training whilst attempting to tackle Alessandro Nesta. Upon his recovery he was disgruntled with new head coach Zdeněk Zeman's stern fitness approach, and both club and player decided to part ways {{at the end of the}} 1994–95 season.|$|E
