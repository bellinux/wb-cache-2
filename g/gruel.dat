5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned <b>gruel</b> or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned <b>gruel.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the energy density of <b>gruels</b> on energy and protein intake and the {{nutrition}} status of 148 hospitalized malnourished children age 3 to 24 months were determined under standardized conditions. Severely malnourished children consumed significantly more high- or low-energy-density <b>gruels</b> than children less affected. The feeding of high-energy-density (1. 0 kcal/ml) versus low-energy-density <b>gruels</b> (0. 5 kcal/ml) allows for {{a significant increase in}} mean energy and protein intakes from <b>gruels</b> : 29. 4 plus or minus 2. 1 (SE) versus 18. 9 plus or minus 1. 4 kcal/kg/day (p < 0. 001), 1. 10 plus or minus 0. 07 versus 0. 75 plus or minus 0. 05 g/kg/day (p < 0. 001). The mean serum albumin concentration tended to increase more for children consuming high-energy-density <b>gruels.</b> These data emphasize the interest of high-energy-density <b>gruels</b> in the rehabilitation of severely malnourished children.

25|$|Some seeds {{usually made}} into <b>gruel</b> in {{historical}} times are acorn and manna grass (Glyceria fluitans). Roots {{of the sea}} beet, Beta maritima, were prepared as well.

25|$|Barley meal, a wholemeal {{barley flour}} lighter than wheat meal but darker in colour, {{is used in}} {{porridge}} and <b>gruel</b> in Scotland. Barley meal <b>gruel</b> is known as sawiq in the Arab world. With {{a long history of}} cultivation in the Middle East, barley is used {{in a wide range of}} traditional Arabic, Assyrian, Israelite, Kurdish, and Persian foodstuffs including kashkak, kashk and murri. Barley soup is traditionally eaten during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. Cholent or hamin (in Hebrew) is a traditional Jewish stew often eaten on Sabbath, in a variety of recipes by both Mizrachi and Ashkenazi Jews, with barley cited throughout the Hebrew Bible in multiple references. In Eastern and Central Europe, barley is also used in soups and stews such as ričet. In Africa, where it is a traditional food plant, it has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.|$|E

25|$|In Taiwan, congee is {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as in Fujian Province, China, and consists of rice and water, with few other ingredients. Sweet potato is often added for taste, and eggs are sometimes beaten into it to thicken it to a <b>gruel.</b> As with most Chinese styles, congee is often served to the ill and those with difficulty chewing. A variety of side dishes are often served with congee, as well.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of items, outside of the {{traditional}} bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called tteok in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (juk), or <b>gruel</b> (mieum) and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and unfiltered versions.|$|E

Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make <b>gruel</b> and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.|$|E

25|$|John Kellogg and {{his brother}} Will Keith Kellogg started the Sanitas Food Company to produce their whole grain cereals around 1897, {{a time when the}} {{standard}} breakfast for the wealthy was eggs and meat, while the poor ate porridge, farina, <b>gruel,</b> and other boiled grains. John and Will later argued over the recipe for the cereals (Will wanted to add sugar to the flakes). So, in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which eventually became the Kellogg Company, triggering a decades-long feud. John then formed the Battle Creek Food Company to develop and market soy products.|$|E
25|$|The monks {{start their}} day at 3:30 a.m., or one hour later during winter, {{when they do}} zazen and read and chant sutras. Breakfast is a bowl of rice <b>gruel</b> with pickles. Then they do chores: clean, weed and, if needed, shovel snow. The floors and {{corridors}} have been polished smooth by daily cleaning for hundreds of years. Then they read and chant again. Dinner at 5 p.m. is meagre and ritualized: {{the position of the}} bowl and utensils is observed. Zazen or a lecture follows before bed at 9 p.m. The trainees shave each other's heads and take a bath every five days (every time the date contains a 4 or 9).|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or <b>gruel</b> made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion {{it was concluded that}} the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E
