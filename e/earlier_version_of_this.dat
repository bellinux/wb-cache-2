25|$|Koester adds insight when he {{concluded}} that Thomas did not evolve from the editing of Synoptic parables but from an independent oral source. From “careful analysis of {{the parable of the}} Sower in the Synoptics and Thomas, John Homan concludes not only that the version in Thomas is independent, but that it does indeed permit us to recover an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> parable.” These examples provide evidence that Crossan’s theory may be accurate when he discusses an early dating of Thomas and the independent oral source.|$|E
