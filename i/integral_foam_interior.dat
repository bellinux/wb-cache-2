40|$|<b>Integral</b> <b>foam</b> {{moulding}} (IFM) is an economical way {{to produce}} castings with integrated cellular structure, i. e. a solid {{skin and a}} foamed core. IFM {{has been known for}} polymers for more than four decades and is well established in industrial production. Polymer <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> parts are accepted as a material system with own properties which simplifies designs, reduces production costs and weight, and increases stiffness and overall strength. On the other hand, <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> moulding for metals is a new field of research. The development of metal based <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> moulding processes at WTM moves along analogous paths as that of polymers by transferring and adapting successful moulding technologies for polymer <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> to metals. Two moulding techniques for metal <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> are presented, a low and a high pressure process. In the low pressure process, the molten metal charged with blowing agent is injected into a permanent steel mould without completely filling it. In this case, the mould gets eventually filled by foam expansion. In the high pressure process foaming is initiated by expansion of the mould cavity after it has been filled completely with the mixture of the metal melt and the blowing agent. The moulded parts are characterized with respect to their cellular structure, density profile and pore size distribution. Mechanical properties such as stiffness and damping behaviour are discussed.

40|$|<b>Integral</b> skin <b>foams</b> {{consist of}} a {{cellular}} core and a near solid skin of the same material surrounding the cope. A study {{of the effect of}} mica on the flexural properties of free rise and <b>integral</b> skin polyurethane <b>foams</b> is presented. Addition of a small amount of mica (5 % v/v) is found to significantly increase the flexural modulus of free rise foams; however, the modulus remains nearly constant with further increase in mica concentration when compared at equal densities. The flexural strength of free rise foams is found to decrease with an increase in mica concentration. Similar trends with mica concentration are obtained for the <b>integral</b> skin <b>foams</b> of a fixed overall density. In this case, the properties of the foams are also dependent on structural parameters such as the skin and core thicknesses and the corresponding densities which are measured. A three region model for the <b>integral</b> skin <b>foam</b> structure (core and two skins) is developed to obtain the flexural modulus and strength for foams with dissimilar upper and lower skins in terms of the thickness and the properties of the regions. Empirical equations, based on the experimental data for free rise foams with different mica loadings, relating the flexural modulus and flexural strength to the density, are used to calculate the properties of each region in the model. The predicted values obtained from the model are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimentally measured values of flexural modulus and flexural strength. The mode of failure (tensile rupture as opposed to wrinkling) is also correctly predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus-containing {{alternatives}} {{have increasingly}} substituted halogen-containing flame retardants in the flame retardancy of PBT. Unfortunately, {{most of the}} flame retardants dete-riorate the mechanical properties of PBT or tend to bloom. Despite their common usage, a detailed understanding of how burning behaviour and material properties {{are influenced by the}} chemical structure of the flame retardants is still missing. The knowledge about the influence of the material's macrostructure on burning behaviour and flame retardancy demands is incomplete, too. In this study, phosphorus polyesters are presented as an alternative to commonly used low-molecular additives for the flame retardancy of compact, glass fibre reinforced and foamed PBT. The pyrolysis and burning behaviour of these polyesters is discussed. The macrostructure of PBT as well as the chemical structure of the phosphorus polyesters was systematically varied to deduce the corresponding structure-property relationships. Glass fibre reinforced PBT has a higher flammability than compact PBT, while PBT <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> has a higher risk of flame spread. The presence of bridging groups and P-O-Carom. -bonds in the phosphorus substituent of the phosphorus polyesters increases their char-forming ability and their condensed-phase activity, respectively. The nature of the active flame-retardancy mechanisms determines the fire risks, which are reduced. One of the phosphorus polyesters, PET-P-DOPO, forms an immiscible blend with PBT. PET-P-DOPO has a good flame-retardancy performance and deteriorates the mechanical properties less than common flame retardants. Additionally, it still has the potential for further optimisation. An improved miscibility and a higher phosphorus content would improve the mechanical properties and the flame-retardancy performance, respectively. PET-P-DOPO is less suited to flame retard PBT <b>integral</b> <b>foam.</b> In glass fibre reinforced PBT, however, PET-P-DOPO outperforms common flame-retardant additives even if they are used with a higher phospho-rus content than PET-P-DOPO. The results essentially contribute to the understanding of fundamental structure-property relationships in flame retardancy of polymers. They permit to predict specific flame-retardancy demands from the material's macrostructure. Furthermore, the results allow a more specific selection and optimisation of existing flame retardants through the modification of their chemical structure and a targeted design of new flame retardants for specific applica-tions or protection goals, respectively. A promising alternative to common additives for the flame retardancy of PBT was found with PET-P-DOPO...|$|R

40|$|Polyurethane <b>integral</b> skin <b>foams</b> {{comprise}} a low density foamed core {{surrounded by a}} high density skin of the same material, and are made in a single molding operation. Polyurethane <b>integral</b> skin <b>foams</b> find wide application as structural materials, and the mechanical properties of such foams are significantly affected by the foam structure, {{which in turn is}} determined by the foaming process. An experimental and theoretical study of the foam formation process is presented. Experimental results show that increase in the mold wall temperature results in an increase in the upper skin thickness, a decrease in the lower skin thickness, and a decrease in the density of both skins. The core density increases with increasing wall temperature. Increase in the blowing agent concentration produces a small increase in the skin thickness. Computations based on the model of Marciano et al. [Polym. Eng. Sci, 26, 717 (1986) ] are presented using an efficient numerical technique. Predictions of the model for the skin thickness, core density and pressure and temperature variation with time are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The model, however, predicts higher skin densities than the experimental measurements. A modification of the initial condition of the model to account for the air bubbles dispersed during mixing gives better agreement between theory and experiment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Integral</b> skin <b>foam</b> (designated ISF) {{consisting}} of core (cellular foam) and solid skin {{is produced in}} one operation. Since the recommendation of Montreal Protocol in 1987 to phase out five CFCs, the three major possibilities for producing ISF studied in the past include replacement of CFC with HCFC, HFC, or water. Recently, the use of HCFC- 141 b for blowing agent was also phased {{out at the end}} of 2003, and HFCs have been criticized for their high Global Warming Potential (GWP). However, it is difficult to produce a skin layer using water as the blowing agent because carbon dioxide (CO 2), which is generated by an isocyanate–water reaction is unlikely to condense at the mold surface. We have developed a new technology to produce all-water-blown ISF. A novel polypropylene glycol, which contains an extremely small amount of by-products (monool) and has narrow molecular weight distribution compared with conventional polypropylene glycols was applied to this new system. In case of applying this novel polypropylene glycol in all-water-blown ISF system, it is easy to control the balance between the gelling reaction and blowing reaction of ISF. Therefore, we have been able to obtain a tight skin layer like HFC-blown ISF. KEY WORDS: <b>integral</b> skin <b>foam,</b> polypropylene glycols, low monol, all water blown...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the lightweight}} potential of long fibre-reinforced and local continuous fibre-reinforced foam injection moulded components. Using the LFT-D foam process and breathing mould technology, long glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene foams were manufactured with a constant weight {{per unit area}} and varying density reductions. As the area moment of inertia increases with the wall thickness to the third power, in these investigations small density reductions were sufficient to increase the flexural rigidity by several hundred percent compared to a compact reference sample. The fibre length advantage generated by the direct process (injection moulding compounding) also meant that even at higher density reductions the ductility was not reduced by the foaming. In order to achieve even better mechanical properties, foam injection moulding can be combined with local continuous fibre reinforcement. To demonstrate the existing potential, sandwich <b>integral</b> <b>foam</b> components with local continuous fibre-reinforced facing were in-situ produced in an injection mould and characterised. Fully consolidated tape blanks and self-reinforced PP fabrics were positioned {{on both sides of the}} cavity and heated. Afterwards a gas-loaded melt was injected between them.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to study the controlling mechanisms involved in the transition from smoldering to flaming of a porous combustible material, flexible polyurethane foam, with an air flow forced across one of the porous-fuel surfaces. The experiments are performed in a small-scale, vertical, combustion wind tunnel, with the air flow forced upward and parallel to an exposed foam surface that forms one of {{the walls of the}} tunnel test section. Smolder is initiated {{at the bottom of the}} sample and propagates upward in the same direction as the forced and buoyancy-induced flows. The resulting smolder is therefore two-dimensional and forward. Thermocouple measurements of the <b>foam</b> <b>interior,</b> along with visual observations, when compared with schlieren interferometry images of the gas phase at the porous-fuel/air-flow interface, indicate that transition to flaming occurs inside the hot char region below the smolder front and not at the interface. An innovative ultrasonic imaging technique is employed to track the evolution of the char per-meability in real time, evincing that the char continues to react and increase substantially in permeability long after the primary smolder front has passed. The ongoing heterogeneous reactions in the char region result in the formation of large voids that provide locations for the onset of homogeneous gas-phase reactions. Furthermore, the higher permeability of the char favors the flow of oxidizer, as well as pyrolysis vapors produced by the primary smolder reaction, into the char interior, which, in conjunction with the reduced heat losses, leads to the onset of a homogeneous gas-phase ignition. This process results in the transition from slow smoldering to fast, exothermic, gas-phase reactions, which rapidly engulfs the entire fuel sample in flames...|$|R
