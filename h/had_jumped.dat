5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who <b>had</b> <b>jumped</b> from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E

5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which <b>had</b> <b>jumped</b> up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, and then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who <b>had</b> <b>jumped</b> before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|According to its literature, the Livestock Conservancy {{is funded}} by grants, sales of {{publications}} and promotional materials, membership dues and public donations. Publications sold include books on conservation and genetics, livestock husbandry, farming operations and breed guides. In the 1998 fiscal year, the organization claimed slightly over US$308,000 in income, coming mainly from public donations and membership dues, but also including service revenue, investment income and sales of goods. By 2009, this amount <b>had</b> <b>jumped</b> to slightly more than US$440,000, mainly from donations, grants and service revenue, but also including investment income. In 1998, the organization claimed slightly over US$288,000 in expenses, allocated mainly to program services, but with just under US$30,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. By 2009, expenses stood at almost US$490,000, spent mostly on employee salaries, benefits and other compensation (which includes program service expenses), but with almost US$150,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. The organization claims around 3,000 members as of 2009, a number up from 2,300 in 1989. It operates {{with a staff of}} nine, headed by an executive director, and a nineteen-member board of directors.|$|E

5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which <b>had</b> <b>jumped</b> up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the sinking, Royal Oaks survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived the sinking while serving as a Boy, First Class on Royal Oak, served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, Southsea, on the anniversary of the sinking. The last remaining survivor of Royal Oak, Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016.
