I always felt like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was my place in the universe, always felt like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blood." ...|$|E

The band got its recording deal {{as a favor}} for the artwork bassist Mike D'Antonio created for Ferret. The label's CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album {{out to the public}} because he thought the album [...] "ruled", and stated [...] "I had a one-off deal and when I knew they wanted to go someplace bigger, I figured <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them." [...] After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A man, Mike Gitter.|$|E

500|$|Takemitsu's {{sensitivity}} to instrumental and orchestral timbre {{can be heard}} throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as November Steps, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, shakuhachi and biwa, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example Quotation of Dream (1991), Archipelago S., for 21 players (1993), and ArcI & II (1963–66/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional [...] "groups". Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, [...] "Takemitsu's genius for instrumentation (and genius <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view) ...", {{in the words of}} Oliver Knussen, [...] "... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed".|$|E
500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It {{has been attributed to}} Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John's head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
500|$|The courts' {{cautiously}} optimistic acceptance of Pepper, which included {{an attempt to}} include it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, soon began to wane. Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of Hansard, and the Lords itself initially followed it in R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson, several objections and limits were expressed in later obiter dicta and ratio decidendi. The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings, where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created. In {{a speech to the}} Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment [...] "a regrettable decision" [...] that [...] "was not only misguided in practical terms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view contrary to principle", saying that: [...] The courts immediately began to [...] "whittle down" [...] the precedent set by Pepper. The first direct attack came through Massey v Boulden, where the Court of Appeal held that Hansard could not be used in criminal law cases, because of [...] "the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard".|$|E

500|$|The poor {{reception}} prompt Hadfield {{to release}} an apology to Minogue, blaming himself {{for not being}} {{in control of the}} promotion; [...] "I loved her voice, got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her." [...] Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] due to Minogue's approach to [...] "obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E
500|$|Hiddleston is {{well known}} for his {{portrayal}} of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E

If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power to do something, I had to do something.... Although I did not know what asylum, deportation, irregular immigration, or the Dublin agreement meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty." [...] Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment.|$|E
