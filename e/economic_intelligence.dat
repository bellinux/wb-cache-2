25|$|Basic {{training}} commences with 'pep talks' {{to boost}} {{the morale of the}} new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised with the real world of intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, Space Technology, Information Security, Energy Security and Scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise in a foreign language and introduced to Geo strategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like CIA, KGB, ISI, Mossad and MI6 are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in Gurgaon. A multi-disciplinary school of <b>economic</b> <b>intelligence</b> is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.|$|E
25|$|A foreign {{intelligence}} service, {{similar to the}} Central Intelligence Agency of the United States and MI6 of the United Kingdom, has never been established in Canada. However, {{through a number of}} agencies and through its Foreign Affairs postings, it has provided considerable political and <b>economic</b> <b>intelligence</b> to Ottawa decision makers. Whether most Canadians recognize it or not, this has very much blurred the boundaries as to what is required before a {{foreign intelligence}} service (FIS) is said to exist. For better or for worse, the debate on this topic has not received as much attention in Canada as it has around the world. Thinking has been that, {{due to the lack of}} clear and present danger to Canada, the high cost and political risk involved, such an agency is not a necessity. However, supporters of a dedicated Canadian agency noted that Canada could not rely on its interests coinciding with those of the UK and USA which supplied its intelligence, in contrast to the Cold War period when they shared a common enemy. A dedicated agency might also boost Canada's international standing and increase its global influence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{activities}} of the Resistance were largely directed towards undermining the German monopoly on information, and providing moral support to the population, by spreading counter-propaganda by word-of-mouth, leaflets, posters and later whole newspapers. Additionally, the Resistance helped Allied POWs and shot-down pilots, [...] "deserters" [...] from the Wehrmacht and other endangered Luxembourgers to cross the borders into Belgium or France. The introduction of forced labour and conscription into the Wehrmacht added to the Resistance's tasks: {{a large number of}} youths who refused to serve in the German armed forces now had to be hidden around the country and kept safe and fed, or helped to escape abroad. Collections of food and money were also made to help the families of those who were arrested, deported, or fired from their jobs. An increasingly important part of the Resistance's activities was to provide military, political and <b>economic</b> <b>intelligence</b> to the Allies. While some acts of sabotage did take place, they were rare and were seen as too risky in a small country with no remote areas to which they could withdraw. For similar reasons, armed combat by the Resistance against the occupiers was rare. Finally, many of the movements made contact with the government-in-exile, the Allies, and the French and Belgian resistance movements, with many young men joining the armed resistance in France and Belgium.|$|E

2500|$|Neuhausen {{was born}} on 13 December 1887 {{in the town of}} Merzig in the Rhine Province of the German Empire. Nothing is known of his family or life before World War I, and he was a pilot in the German Air Force during that war. In the inter-war period he reached the rank of Gruppenführer (major general) in the National Socialist Flyers Corps ( [...] , NSFK) which was a {{paramilitary}} Nazi Party organisation similar to the Sturmabteilung or SA. He was stationed in Belgrade from 1931 onwards, first as the manager of the German Transportation Office, then as the official representative or party attache (Landesgruppenleiter) of the Nazi Party in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and finally as the German consul-general, with the rank of Consul-General Major of the Luftwaffe. It is likely that he fulfilled both political and <b>economic</b> <b>intelligence</b> work in Yugoslavia throughout the 1930s. He had effective networks in both government and political circles and kept himself well informed about political and economic conditions, becoming a wealthy industrialist in the process. With the assistance of his close friend Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring he obtained shares in a range of mining and metal industries through dubious transactions. As a result of such deals, Neuhausen was arrested by the Gestapo several times but Göring interceded on his behalf on each occasion to ensure that the serious charges were downgraded. In return, Neuhausen provided Göring with foreign currency, and when he attended the Reichsmarshalls birthday party each year he gave Göring a [...] bar of gold or silver. Göring used this money to amass a huge collection of artworks and jewelry at his country estate, Carinhall. As consul-general, Neuhausen negotiated the purchase of the huge Bor copper mines from the defeated French in 1940, and subsequently became {{chairman of the board of}} the new German company that operated the mines, Bor Kupferbergwerke und Hütten A.G. in Belgrade.|$|E

2500|$|In Vietnamese {{business}} circles, the Hoa were dubbed as [...] "Crownless kings", [...] "rice kings", [...] "gasoline kings", or [...] "scrap-iron kings". Highly publicized {{profiles of}} wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs attracted great public interest and {{were used to}} illustrate the community's strong economic clout. [...] The huge materials supply system ensured maximum support for ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs for whatever goods and services they provided to their clients. The market was allegedly calibrated so as to ensure maximum profits and manipulated prices through import-export and transport systems. The Chinese also act as act as agents for [...] expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors outside of Vietnam that act as their underlings and providers of <b>economic</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Under the Saigon administration, a rapid influx of Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs from Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan came to South Vietnam for business and investment activities. The Hoa compradore bourgeoisie in South Vietnam also had {{the economic and political}} backing of wealthy expatriate Chinese from Taiwan and Hong Kong and Overseas Chinese capitalists in the United States and other countries in Southeast Asia. As the Hoa entrepreneurs in South Vietnam became more financially prosperous, they often pooled large amounts of seed capital and started joint business ventures with expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese business moguls and investors from all over the world. In addition, prominent Hoa compradore bourgeoisie often colluding and mingling with Saigon government officials and the South Vietnamese army elite to attain even greater wealth. The most notorious of South Vietnam's Hoa compradore bourgeoisie was Ly Long Than, who reportedly held large assets in 18 major commercial and industrial manufacturing enterprises (Vinatexco and Vinafilco textile factories, Vinatefinco dye-works, Vicasa steel factory, Nakydaco edible oil factory, Rang Dong sea transport company, a real estate company, a plush hotel, an insurance provider, and many restaurants) and sixteen banks including the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, and the Agriculture Industry Commerce Bank. Foreign investors and visitors doing business in Cholon would recall seeing the plethora of import-export shipping giants, banks, modern high-rise buildings, plush hotels and nightclubs, and restaurants all owned by Hoa businessmen. Other Hoa compradore bourgeoisie capitalists include Hoan Kim Quy, a native of Hanoi where he owned a prominent shipping firm and made his fortune from barbed wire manufacturing, the operation of a large textile and appliance import company and a gold mining and trading firm. He was the Director of the Vitako Company and was a major shareholder in several banks.|$|E

A simple calibration exercise in the spirit of Bils and Klenow (2000) and Castro (2005) is conducted.
