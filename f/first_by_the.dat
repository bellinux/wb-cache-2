In the final poll of the season, Alabama dropped into the No.7 position in the AP and No.8 position in the Coaches' Polls after their loss against Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever rings {{in with the}} right answer.

Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, {{made plans}} to create a 200-strong mounted police force to {{maintain}} order along the border; such a force, he thought, would enable the colonisation {{of the region and}} be much cheaper than deploying regular military units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the border area as a liminal, ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternate strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the border region itself and establish law and order there.|$|E

By December 1914, the BEF had expanded, fielding five army corps divided between the First and the Second Armies. As the Regular Army's {{strength}} declined, the numbers were made up— <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Territorial Force, then by the volunteers of Field Marshal Kitchener's New Army. By the end of August 1914, he had raised six new divisions; by March 1915, the number of divisions had increased to 29. The Territorial Force was also expanded, raising second and third battalions and forming eight new divisions, which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions. The Third Army was formed in July 1915 and with the influx of troops from Kitchener's volunteers and further reorganisation, the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army, which became the Fifth Army were formed in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
5|$|Operations of {{the ancient}} Amber Road - a trans-European, north-south amber trade route, {{continued}} and intensified during the Roman Empire times. From the 1st century BC the Amber Road connected the Baltic Sea shores and Aquileia, an important amber processing center. This route was controlled <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Celts, and later by the Romans south of the Danube, by Germanic tribes north of that river, and was used for transporting a variety of traded merchandise (and slaves) besides amber. As told in Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder, {{during the reign of}} Nero an equestrian of unknown name led an expedition to the Baltic shorelines, from where he brought a huge quantity of amber, which was subsequently used for propaganda purposes during public games - gladiator fights. The infrastructure of the Amber Road was destroyed by Germanic and Sarmatian attacks {{in the second half of}} the 3rd century AD; to a lesser degree it was still used intermittently until the mid-6th century. The Przeworsk culture sites provide a rich assortment of Amber Road traded objects.|$|E

5|$|Richard's {{approach}} to kingship {{was rooted in}} his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration {{of which can be}} found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged <b>first</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, Edward III, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of {{power in the hands of}} the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.|$|E
