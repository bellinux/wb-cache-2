40|$|ABSTRACT: Heavy {{rainfall}} {{often leads}} to complete suspension of highway construction due to saturated and unworkable soil conditions. Therefore, quantifying the impact of rainfall on the productivity of highway con-struction is essential in preparing realistic schedules and cost estimates for the preconstruction stage and in analyzing weather-related claims for the postconstruction stage. This paper presents a decision support system for quantifying the impact of rainfall on productivity and duration of common highway construction operations, namely: earthmoving, construction of base courses, construction of <b>drainage</b> <b>layers,</b> and paving operations. The system incorporates a knowledgebase and a database. The knowledgebase includes if/then type rules, acquired from experts in highway construction operations, and the database contains hourly records of weather parameters from the closest weather station to the construction site.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Marginal soils can be {{improved}} by introducing permeable geosynthetics as <b>drainage</b> <b>layers.</b> However, clogging of the geotextile pores causes significant reduction in drain capacity, which {{in the long run}} affects stability of the earth structures built up with poorly drained backfills. This paper reports performance of a geosynthetic drain layer placed within two fine-grained soil slurries. A multipurpose consolidation test device has been developed for this purpose. Test results demonstrated that thick geocomposite layers are good enough in draining out water escaped during consolidation. In order to reduce clogging, a combination thin sand mat and geosynthetic drain layer, which is called hybrid system, has been tested. Thin sand mat has been found effective in preventing finer grains from clogging the geocomposite layer. Bearing capacity tests on model embankments proved that hybrid system generates frictional interaction with the rough surface of the geocomposite. This study shows that hybrid system performs well as anti-clogging drain layer within fine-grained soil. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{relative}} maturity of landfill design practice, world-wide {{there are still}} significant numbers of large scale failures of waste bodies, often incorporating the lining system. In addition, there is growing evidence that post waste placement deformations in the lining system are leading to loss of function (i. e. discontinuous <b>drainage</b> <b>layers,</b> loss on protection and leaking liners). Best practice has established that both stability and integrity of the lining system must be assessed during the design process, and specifically that interaction between the waste body and lining system should be considered both in the short-term (i. e. during construction) and long-term (i. e. following waste degradation). The paper introduces available analysis approaches, reviews knowledge of waste behaviour required for such analyses and provides guidance on the mechanisms to consider. The need for field monitoring to validate numerical models is established as {{is the need for}} extensive measurements of waste mechanics properties linked to a standard classification system to aid comparison and use.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of {{nonwoven}} geotextiles and geocomposite <b>drainage</b> <b>layers</b> as moisture barriers in geotechnical applications where capillary flow is expected.

This study includes an evaluation of the material properties governing the hydraulic behavior of soils and geosynthetics in these applications, as well as an investigation of capillary rise using physical models of layered soil-geosynthetic systems. Capillary rise was observed to occur rapidly in a control model containing only soil, while capillary rise occurred more slowly when a nonwoven geotextile was placed between two soil layers. This is attributed to the low hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile when unsaturated. Capillary rise was prevented when using a geocomposite between two soil layers, due to the presence of an air gap in the geonet between the two geotextiles. Filter paper measurements indicate that negative water pressure is transmitted from the soil through the nonwoven geotextile, but not across the geocomposite...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the heat, air, and moisture conditions of slab-on-ground of a heated building. Measurements show that the coarse-grained fill or <b>drainage</b> <b>layers</b> beneath heated slab-on-ground struc-tures are warm and moist throughout the year. Moisture migration: gravitational water, ground water table, capillary action and diffusion, keep these layer moist throughout the year. The water vapor content of the warm and moist fill layer is usually higher than the content of the indoor air. Thus, the diffusion flow is directed into the indoor air, despite the existing heat flow into the opposite direction, and the ground is a moisture source for the structures above. Therefore, thermal and moisture conditions of the fill layers have the major effect on the overall moisture behavior of ground slabs: on the drying times of the fresh in situ cast concrete slab, and on the thermal and moisture behavior of the structure in normal long-term conditions. These conditions are also favorable for microbe growth, which is very common in fill layers. Fungal or bacterial growth was detected in 98 % of the test specimens taken beneath the ground slabs of heated buildings. These conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Green planted roofs: A {{green roof}} is a roof that is {{partially}} or completely covered with vegetation {{and a growing}} medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. A green roof typically consists of many layers, including an insulation layer; a waterproof membrane, often vinyl; a <b>drainage</b> <b>layer,</b> usually made of lightweight gravel, clay, or plastic; a geotextile or filter mat that allows water to soak through but prevents erosion of fine soil particles; a growing medium; plants; and, sometimes, a wind blanket. Green roofs are classified as either intensive or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and amount of maintenance required. Traditional roof gardens, which are labor-intensive and require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants are considered intensive, while extensive green roofs are nearly self-sustaining and require less maintenance.|$|E

50|$|The {{soil type}} {{is one of}} the most {{essential}} factors during site planning. The soil needs to provide adequate bearing capacity and drainage, and help to retain heat. With respects to drainage, the most suitable type of soil for earth sheltering is a mixture of sand and gravel. Well graded gravels have a large bearing capacity (about 8,000 pounds per square foot), excellent drainage and a low frost heave potential. Sand and clay can be susceptible to erosion. Clay soils, while least susceptible to erosion, often do not allow for proper drainage, and have a higher potential for frost heaves. Clay soils are more susceptible to thermal shrinking and expanding. Being aware of the moisture content of the soil and the fluctuation of that content throughout the year will help prevent potential heating problems. Frost heaves can also be problematic in some soil. Fine grain soils retain moisture the best and are most susceptible to heaving. A few ways to protect against capillary action responsible for frost heaves are placing foundations below the freezing zone or insulating ground surface around shallow footings, replacement of frost sensitive soils with granular material, and interrupting capillary draw of moisture by putting a <b>drainage</b> <b>layer</b> of coarser material in the existing soil.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Contemporary {{design of}} lined {{landfills}} in the United States {{began in the}} early 1980 ’s with Federal regulations focused on hazardous waste disposal. This regulatory framework was expanded to include municipal solid waste in the early 1990 ’s. With nearly 30 -years experience in the design of lined landfills, simple design practices have evolved to ensure the successful performance of lined landfills. Geosynthetic components {{play a critical role in}} the two main components of these landfills: (1) liners to limit the vertical migration of liquids, and (2) drainage field that collect the liquids and limit the potential for leaks to develop. Geomembrane liners provide a very stable barrier to the spread of liquids but must be built to very high standards, be protected from damage during construction and their service life, and come with the potential for stability problems generated by their slick surfaces. Geosynthetic drainage composites provide a means of draining the collected liquid from large areas of the liner surface. Properly designed, such geosynthetic <b>drainage</b> <b>layers</b> will add to the stability of the landfill by limiting hydrostatic forces due to the collected liquids. Past failures of lined landfills provide an effective means of demonstrating the inevitable consequences of not meeting fundamental design requirements for these components...|$|R
40|$|Waste from {{construction}} and demolition activities {{represents one of}} the highest volumes of waste in Europe. 500 million tonnes are produced throughout the whole EU every year. In some EU members like Spain, approximately 83 per cent of such waste is disposed in landfills.
