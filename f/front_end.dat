5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck. <b>Front</b> <b>end</b> loaders with large box-like <b>front</b> <b>end</b> attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E

5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the <b>front</b> <b>end,</b> and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes {{much larger than the}} other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|Both Spykers {{and both}} Super Aguris were {{knocked out of}} the first phase of qualifying, along with Alexander Wurz's Williams and Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. For Super Aguri's Takuma Sato, it did not matter where he qualified, as he was docked ten places, due to {{overtaking}} Jenson Button under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix. Spykers Adrian Sutil was hoping for a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying. At the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the grid, the McLarens were first and fourth, with Hamilton on top, and the Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth. Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the top five.|$|E

5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located {{at the back of}} the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{runs with}} a three-person crew: two {{operators}} control the train {{from the cab}} at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the train and handle related operations, while a third crew member is the Customer Service Ambassador. Stationed in a designated car {{in the middle of}} each train, the Customer Service Ambassador operates the doors and wheelchair ramp, makes station stop announcements, and is dedicated to assisting customers on board. Bombardier Transportation is responsible for providing train operations, taking over from CN crews in 2007 and CP crews in 2015. GO trains achieve on-time performance of approximately 95%, and a refund will be provided if a train is more than 15 minutes late, with some conditions.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active <b>front</b> <b>end</b> (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{we present}} area-efficient {{multiple}} antenna transceiver <b>front</b> <b>ends.</b> A {{portion of the}} greatly increased capacity (compared to a single antenna system) of the multiple antenna system is traded off for relaxed circuit noise requirements. This allows circuits without physically large on-chip inductors to be used, resulting in significant chip area savings. Comparing the area and noise performance between a narrowband low noise amplifier (LNA) and a broadband LNA shows a simulated 3 dB increase in noise figure but a threefold decrease in area. Furthermore, multiple receiver <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> for a proposed four transmit, four receive antenna (4 x 4) system have a smaller area than some reported single <b>front</b> <b>ends...</b>|$|R

While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
5|$|P90 Laserex models:The P90 LV (Laser Visible) and P90 IR (InfraRed) models, both {{of which}} were {{introduced}} in late 1995, have an integrated laser sight manufactured by Laserex Technologies in Australia. The P90 LV model projects an 8 mW visible laser intended {{to be used as a}} low-light shooting aid or for dissuasive effect, while the P90 IR model projects a 4.5 mW infrared laser that can only be seen with night vision equipment. Both laser systems are compact, consisting of a small, flat panel integrated into the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the weapon's frame.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping {{in front of the}} muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
