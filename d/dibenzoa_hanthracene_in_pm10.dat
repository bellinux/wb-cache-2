40|$|Abstract Objective: In Christchurch {{there is}} concern that winter air pollution, {{dominated}} by particulate matter (PM₁₀) from domestic heating, causes a local increase in cases of cardiorespiratory disease. Our aim was to investigate whether the particulate levels did influence emergency hospital admissions, and if so to what extent. Method: Air pollution and meteorological data was obtained from a Canterbury Regional Council monitoring station. Two local hospitals provided data on emergency admissions for both adults and children with cardiac and respiratory disorders. All data was obtained for the period from June 1988 to December 1998. Missing PM₁₀ data was interpolated from other known pollution values when necessary. The PM₁₀ data was compared to the admissions data using a time series analysis approach, with weather variables controlled for using a generalised additive model. Results: There was a significant association between PM₁₀ levels and cardiorespiratory admissions. For children and adults combined there was a 3. 4 % increase in respiratory admissions for every interquartile (14. 8 µg/m³) increase <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀.</b> <b>In</b> adults there was a 1. 3 % increase in cardiac admissions for each interquartile increase <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀.</b> There was no relationship between PM₁₀ levels and appendicitis, the condition that we selected to be our control. Conclusion: In Christchurch {{there is a significant}} relationship between particulate levels and the admissions for cardiac and respiratory illnesses. The size of the effect is comparable to other international studies, and the greatest impact is seen on the respiratory system...|$|R

This paper describes effect modification of temperature <b>in</b> the <b>PM(10)</b> -mortality association and tests the hypothesis that higher <b>PM(10)</b> effects <b>in</b> summer are due to enhanced exposure to particles. All deaths of residents of nine Italian cities between 1997 and 2004 were selected. The case-crossover approach was adopted to estimate the effect of PM(10) on mortality by season and temperature level. Three strata of temperature corresponding to low, medium, and high "ventilation" were identified, and the interaction between PM(10) and temperature within each stratum was examined. Season and temperature levels strongly modified the PM(10) -mortality association: for a 10 -microg/m(3) variation <b>in</b> <b>PM(10),</b> a 2. 54 % increase in risk of death in summer (95 % confidence interval: 1. 31, 3. 78) compared with 0. 20 % (95 % confidence interval: - 0. 08, 0. 49) in winter. Analysis of the interaction between PM(10) and temperature within temperature strata resulted in positive but, in most cases, nonstatistically significant coefficients. The authors found much higher PM(10) effects on mortality during warmer days. The hypothesis that such an effect is attributable to enhanced exposure to particles in summer could not be rejected...|$|R
40|$|As one of China's great metropolises, Taiyuan is {{generally}} recognized {{to be one}} of the most polluted cities in the world, It is affected by pollution from heavy industries, and from organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In this study, we measured the concentrations of OCPs in various environmental media in Taiyuan. We measured the levels of OCPs in 15 soil samples and 34 samples of respirable particulate matter (PM) (17 Of PM(2. 5) and 17 of PM(10)) from urban areas of Taiyuan. Analysis of the composition ratios of OCP residues revealed that dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were the predominant compounds in Soil, PM(2. 5) and PM(10). The total DDT concentrations were 1. 8 - 1. 0 x 10 (2) ng g(- 1) in soil, 6. 5 - 1. 0 x 10 (3) pg m(- 3) in PM(2. 5), and 8. 5 - 1. 5 x 10 (3) pg m(- 3) <b>in</b> <b>PM(10).</b> The total HCH concentrations were 1. 4 - 45 ng g(- 1) in soil, 5. 2 - 8. 0 x 10 (2) pg m(- 3) in PM(2. 5), and 9. 6 - 8. 7 x 10 (2) pg m(- 3) <b>in</b> <b>PM(10).</b> Furthermore, source analysis indicated that there was new input of OCPs at some sites. Finally, analysis of the individual OCPs revealed that new OCP contamination was the major problem in Taiyuan. This study suggests that measures should be taken to reduce the levels of OCP residues in order to improve the environmental quality in Taiyuan. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} ambient particulate matter on variation in childhood prevalence of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema. Methods: Prevalences of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema obtained in Phase One of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) were matched with city-level estimates of residential PM 10 obtained from a World Bank model. Associations were investigated using binomial regression adjusting for GNP per capita and for clustering within country. For countries {{with more than one}} centre, a two stage meta-analysis was carried out. The results were compared with a meta-analysis of published multi-centre studies. Results: Annual concentrations of PM₁₀ at city level were obtained for 105 ISAAC centres in 51 countries. After controlling for GNP per capita, there was a weak negative association between PM₁₀ and various outcomes. For severe wheeze in 13 - 14 -year-olds, the OR for a 10 μg/m³ increase <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀</b> was 0. 92 (95 CI 0. 84 to 1. 00). In 24 countries with more than one centre, most summary estimates for within-country associations were weakly positive. For severe wheeze in 13 - 14 -year-olds, the summary OR for a 10 μg/m³ increase <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀</b> was 1. 01 (0. 92 to 1. 10). This result was close to a summary OR of 0. 99 (0. 91 to 1. 06) obtained from published multi-centre studies. Conclusions: Modelled estimates of particulate matter at city level are imprecise and incomplete estimates of personal exposure to ambient air pollutants. Nevertheless, our results together with those of previous multi-centre studies, suggest that urban background PM₁₀ has little or no association with the prevalence of childhood asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or eczema either within or between countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives We {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} PM(10) concentration and out-of-hospital coronary deaths in eight Italian cities during 1997 - 2004. Methods 16 989 subjects aged > 35 years who died out-of-hospital from coronary causes were studied and hospital admissions in the previous 2 years identified. We studied {{the effect of the}} mean of current and previous day PM 10 values (lag 0 - 1). A city-specific case-crossover analysis was applied using a time-stratified approach considering as confounders weather, holidays, influenza epidemics, and summer decrease in population. The pooled percentage increase (95 % CI) in mortality per 10 mu g/m(3) increase <b>in</b> <b>PM(10)</b> was estimated. Results A statistically significant increase in out-of-hospital coronary deaths was related to a 10 mu g/m(3) increase <b>in</b> <b>PM(10)</b> : 1. 46 % (95 % CI 0. 50 to 2. 43). Although no statistically significant effect modification by age was found, the effect was stronger among subjects aged > 65 years (1. 60 %, 0. 59 to 2. 63), particularly those aged 65 - 74 (3. 01 %, 0. 74 to 5. 34). People in the lowest socio-economic category (3. 34 %, 1. 28 to 5. 45) had a stronger effect than those in the highest category. No clear effect modification was seen for gender, season or any specific comorbidity. An indication of negative effect modification was seen for previous admission for cardiac dysrhythmias. Subjects without hospital admissions in the previous 2 years were slightly more affected by PM(10) effects (1. 91 %, 0. 28 to 3. 47) than those with at least one previous hospital admission (1. 44 %, 0. 09 to 2. 82). Conclusions Our results show that short term exposure to PM(10) is associated with coronary mortality especially among the elderly and socio-economically disadvantaged. No clear effect modification by previous hospitalisations was detected except for cardiac dysrhythmias, possibly due to protective treatment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{findings}} of prior studies {{of air pollution}} effects on adverse birth outcomes are difficult to synthesize because of differences in study design. OBJECTIVES: The International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes was formed to understand how differences in research methods contribute to variations in findings. We initiated a feasibility study to a) assess the ability of geographically diverse research groups to analyze their data sets using a common protocol and b) perform location-specific analyses of air pollution effects on birth weight using a standardized statistical approach. METHODS: Fourteen research groups from nine countries participated. We developed a protocol to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between particulate matter <= 10 mu m <b>in</b> aerodynamic diameter (<b>PM(10))</b> and low birth weight (LBW) among term births, adjusted first for socioeconomic status (SES) and second for additional location-specific variables. RESULTS: Among locations with data for the PM(10) analysis, ORs estimating the relative risk of term LBW associated with a 10 -mu g/m(3) increase <b>in</b> average <b>PM(10)</b> concentration during pregnancy, adjusted for SES, ranged from 0. 63 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 30 - 1. 35] for the Netherlands to 1. 15 (95 % CI, 0. 61 - 2. 18) for Vancouver, with six research groups reporting statistically significant adverse associations. We found evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity in estimated effects among locations.

40|$|During {{the winters}} of 2010 and 2011, three {{intensive}} particulate matter (PM) monitoring campaigns were undertaken in Masterton, Alexandra and Nelson, New Zealand. The goal of these campaigns was, {{for the first}} time, to identify the sources and factors contributing to elevated PM concentrations on an hourly time-scale. In each location, hourly coarse (PM₁₀-₂. ₅; particles with aerodynamic diameters 2. 5 μm < d < 10 μm) and fine (PM₂. ₅; particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2. 5 μm) samples, PM₁₀ (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 10 μm, incorporating the coarse and fine fractions) concentrations and meteorological variables were collected {{from a number of}} sites. Using elemental concentrations determined from ion beam analysis and black carbon concentrations determined from light reflection for each hourly sample, PM sources and their contributions on an hourly time-scale were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF). In Masterton, where two sampling sites were employed, PM₁₀ concentrations displayed distinct diurnal cycles, with peak concentrations occurring in the evening (7 pm–midnight) and in the morning (7 – 9 am). Four PM sources were identified (biomass burning, marine aerosol, crustal matter and vehicles) at each of the sites and biomass burning was identified as the most dominant source of PM₁₀ during both the evening and morning. One of the sites experienced consistently higher PM₁₀ concentrations and katabatic flows across Masterton were identified to be the main contributor to this phenomenon. In Alexandra and Nelson, three sampling sites on a horizontal transect (upwind, central and downwind of the general katabatic flow pathway) and a fourth site located centrally, but at a height of 26 m, were incorporated in a novel study design. Each of the sites in Alexandra and Nelson also showed diurnal patterns <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀</b> concentrations. The central site in Alexandra experienced consistently higher PM₁₀ concentrations and four PM₁₀ sources were identified at each of the sites (biomass burning, marine aerosol, vehicles and crustal matter). Biomass burning was identified as the main source of PM₁₀ throughout the day at each of the sites. The convergence of numerous katabatic flows was identified as the contributing factor to the elevated PM₁₀ concentrations measured at the central site. In Nelson, five PM sources were identified at each of the sites (biomass burning, vehicles, marine aerosol, shipping sulfate and crustal matter) and biomass burning was identified as the dominant source of PM₁₀ throughout the day. Katabatic flows were also identified {{to play an important role}} <b>in</b> <b>PM₁₀</b> transport.

According to the EPA Department’s Deputy Director Chang Shuenn-chin (張順欽) this is caused by fugitive dust at riverbanks during the low-flow season of winter. These particles — suspended in the air by wind action and human activities — can be stirred up by the strong northeastern winds occurring in winter, also known as the northeastern monsoon. As such, wind speeds exceeding three meters per second are likely to cause gusts of fugitive dust with PM10 concentration levels above 250μg/m3. High maximum readings <b>in</b> <b>PM10</b> concentration levels <b>in</b> Yunlin County’s Lunbei Township (崙背) in 2015 (2,532μg/m3) and in Chiayi County’s Puzih City (朴子) in 2009 (1,793μg/m3) and; in 2013; in Puzih (497μg/m3) and in Lunbei (497μg/m3) are claimed to be heavily influenced by heavy rainfall and mudslides during Typhoon Morakot in 2009 {{as well as by the}} 6.2 Mw June 2013 Nantou earthquake.

The toxicity of organic fractions from particulate matter have been mainly evaluated by considering their mutagenic activity. This research expands on the toxicologic profile of organic compounds adsorbed to particulate matter, specifically in Puerto Rico, by using the cytotoxic neutral red bioassay (NRB). The NRB uses normal human epidermal keratinocytes or other types of cells to measure the effect on cell viability when exposed to organic compounds associated to the particles in the air. We validated the NRB for particulate matter by using a standard reference material (SRM 1649). We used the NRB to determine toxicologic differences of extracts between an urban industrialized site with anthropogenic activity versus a coastal region with less human activity. The cytotoxicity associated with organic compounds in particulate matter collected at the urban industrialized site was detected in both the particulate matter (3 / 4) 10 microm <b>in</b> aerodynamic diameter (<b>PM(10))</b> and particulate matter (3 / 4) 100 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(100)).

In addition, the nonpolar extracts of both PM(10) and PM(100) exerted the greatest cytotoxicity, followed by the polar, and, finally, the moderately polar extract.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use a range of {{statistical}} tools to assess particulate matter less than 10 μm (<b>PM₁₀)</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere that has been measured daily at five locations in South Australia over a 7 -year period. We consider a wind rose model to provide a graphical display of the frequency distribution of wind speed to explore the role of PM 10 accumulation over time. A generalised least squares technique with a firstorder autoregressive model was applied to the realisation of average changes in PM 10, and these were assessed at the 5 % significance level. This study found the change <b>in</b> variability of <b>PM₁₀</b> concentration over time. The pre-whitened PM₁₀ series were considered as realisations of white noise using correlogram plots. Furthermore, a robust regression technique involving wet (> 0. 5 -mm rainfall) and dry properties (< 0. 5 -mm rainfall) was used to assess the influence of rainfall on PM 10 distributions for the city of Adelaide.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} {{has focused on}} the health effects of ultrafine particles because of the documented toxicity and the larger concentration contrast near motorways of UFP than for PM 10 or PM 2. 5. There are only few studies that have measured UFP at inner-city streets simultaneously with other PM components. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contrast of UFP, PM(10) and soot measured simultaneously at 3 inner-city locations, namely a moderately busy street (15, 000 vehicles/day), a city and a suburban background location. Simultaneously, measurements of particle number concentrations (PNC), PM(10) and soot have been conducted on three locations in and around Utrecht, a medium-sized city in the Netherlands for 20 weekdays in autumn 2008. Measurements were done for 6 -h during afternoon and early evening. The mean PNC at the street location was more than 3 times higher than at the two background locations. The contrast was similar for soot concentrations. <b>In</b> <b>PM(10)</b> concentrations less contrast was found, namely 1. 8 times. Mean PNC concentrations were poorly correlated with PM(10) and soot. At the street location, high temporal variation of PNC concentrations occurred within each sampling day, probably related to variations in traffic volumes, high-emission individual vehicles and wind direction. Temporal variation was smaller at the two background locations. Occasional unexplained short-term peaks occurred at the suburban background location. A relatively high correlation between PNC minute values at the two background locations was found, pointing to similar area-wide sources. Typically low correlations were found with the street locations, consistent with the dominant impact of local traffic. A large contrast between two background locations and a moderately busy urban street location was found for PNC and soot, comparable to previous studies of much busier motorways. Temporal variation of PNC was higher at the street location and uncorrelated with background variations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Our aim was {{to explore}} the {{association}} between respiratory health and proximity air quality in elderly. METHODS: The prevalence of respiratory conditions was linked in 2104 individuals aged > or = 65 years recruited in Bordeaux (3 C Study) to home address concentrations of NO 2, CO, SO 2, fine particles (PM(10)), VOCs and benzene, estimated through a dispersion model combining data on background air pollution, traffic characteristics, and conditions of topographical and meteorological dispersion of air pollutants. RESULTS: Mean [minimum; maximum] values of the annual concentrations (microg/m(3)) of proximity air pollutants were respectively: 28 [18; 72. 2] for NO 2, 420 [350; 1337] for CO, 7. 5 [5; 13. 7] for SO 2, 23. 1 [19; 51] for PM(10), 8. 1 [0. 01; 116. 6] for VOCs and 1. 8 [1. 5; 6. 9] for benzene. Using a binary logistic regression model, PM(10) {{were significantly associated with}} usual cough (Odds-Ratio= 1. 33 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 00 - 1. 77) for exposed compared to non-exposed) and SO(2) with usual cough (1. 55 (1. 16 - 2. 08)) and phlegm (1. 45 (1. 04 - 2. 01)). We found a 10 % and a 23 % increase in usual cough for a 10 microg/m(3) increment <b>in</b> <b>PM(10)</b> and a 1 microg/m(3) increment in SO 2 respectively, and a 23 % increase in usual phlegm for a 1 microg/m(3) increase in SO 2. A sensitivity analysis showed similar results when considering 3 -year proximity pollution. A more pronounced effect of SO 2 and PM(10) on usual cough and phlegm was observed in woman. CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment of exposure to proximity air pollution has shown an increased prevalence of bronchitis-like symptoms in elderly living in areas polluted by SO 2 and PM(10) ...|$|R
40|$|This study explores a large set of OC and EC {{measurements}} <b>in</b> <b>PM(10)</b> and PM(2. 5) aerosol samples, undertaken with a {{long term}} constant analytical methodology, to evaluate the capability of the OC/EC minimum ratio to represent the ratio between the OC and EC aerosol components resulting from fossil fuel combustion (OC(ff) /EC(ff)). The data set covers a wide geographical area in Europe, but with a particular focus upon Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, and includes {{a great variety of}} sites: urban (background, kerbside and tunnel), industrial, rural and remote. The highest minimum ratios were found in samples from remote and rural sites. Urban background sites have shown spatially and temporally consistent minimum ratios, of around 1. 0 for PM(10) and 0. 7 for PM(2. 5). The consistency of results has suggested that the method {{could be used as a}} tool to derive the ratio between OC and EC from fossil fuel combustion and consequently to differentiate OC from primary and secondary sources. To explore this capability, OC and EC measurements were performed in a busy roadway tunnel in central Lisbon. The OC/EC ratio, which reflected the composition of vehicle combustion emissions, was in the range of 03 - 0. 4. Ratios of OC/EC in roadside increment air (roadside minus urban background) in Birmingham, UK also lie within the range 03 - 0. 4. Additional measurements were performed under heavy traffic conditions at two double kerbside sites located in the centre of Lisbon and Madrid. The OC/EC minimum ratios observed at both sites were found to be between those of the tunnel and those of urban background air, suggesting that minimum values commonly obtained for this parameter in open urban atmospheres over-predict the direct emissions of OC(ff) from road transport. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are explored. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relative importance}} of various measures of particulate and gaseous air pollution as predictors of daily mortality in Inchon, South Korea, the association between total daily mortality and air pollution was investigated for a 20 -month period (January 1995 through August 1996). Poisson regression was used to regress daily death counts on each air pollutant, controlling for time trends, season, and meteorologic influences such as temperature and relative humidity. Regression coefficients of a 5 -day moving average of particulate matter less than or = to 10 microm <b>in</b> aerodynamic diameter (<b>PM(10))</b> on total mortality were positively significant when considered separately and simultaneously with other pollutants <b>in</b> the model. <b>PM(10)</b> remained significant when the models were confined to cardiovascular or respiratory mortality. Sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and carbon monoxide (CO) were significantly related to respiratory mortality in the single-pollutant model. Ozone exposure was not statistically significant with regard to mortality in the above models, and graphic analysis showed that the relationship was nonlinear. A combined index of PM(10), nitrogen dioxide, SO(2), and CO seemed to better explain the exposure-response relationship with total mortality than an individual air pollutant. Pollutants should be considered together in the risk assessment of air pollution, as opposed to measuring the risk of individual pollutants...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{findings}} of prior studies {{of air pollution}} effects on adverse birth outcomes are difficult to synthesize because of differences in study design. OBJECTIVES: The International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes was formed to understand how differences in research methods contribute to variations in findings. We initiated a feasibility study to a) assess the ability of geographically diverse research groups to analyze their data sets using a common protocol and b) perform location-specific analyses of air pollution effects on birth weight using a standardized statistical approach. METHODS: Fourteen research groups from nine countries participated. We developed a protocol to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between particulate matter ≤ 10 μm <b>in</b> aerodynamic diameter (<b>PM₁₀)</b> and low birth weight (LBW) among term births, adjusted first for socioeconomic status (SES) and second for additional location-specific variables. RESULTS: Among locations with data for the PM₁₀ analysis, ORs estimating the relative risk of term LBW associated with a 10 -μg/m³ increase <b>in</b> average <b>PM₁₀</b> concentration during pregnancy, adjusted for SES, ranged from 0. 63 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 30 - 1. 35] for the Netherlands to 1. 15 (95 % CI, 0. 61 - 2. 18) for Vancouver, with six research groups reporting statistically significant adverse associations. We found evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity in estimated effects among locations. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in PM₁₀-LBW relationships among study locations remained despite use of a common statistical approach. A more detailed meta-analysis and use of more complex protocols for future analysis may uncover reasons for heterogeneity across locations. However, our findings confirm {{the potential for a}} diverse group of researchers to analyze their data in a standardized way to improve understanding of air pollution effects on birth outcomes...|$|R
