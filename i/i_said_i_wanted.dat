500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Songwriter {{and lead}} singer of the rock group Van Halen, was asked during an {{interview}} in 1985, [...] "When did you first decide {{that you wanted to}} go into show business?" [...] He replied, [...] "I was seven. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be Al Jolson. Those were the only records I had—a collection of the old breakable 78s. I learned every song and then the moves, which I saw in the movies." ...|$|E

"Basically I {{was told}} that my {{commitment}} to the group was not 100% and they wanted more commitment from their lead singer. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do some other things and that the songs were running down. I thought we needed to broaden our horizons a bit but that wasn't to be at that time. I was technically sacked. Beeb, Graeham, and Derek [...] wanted John Farnham in.

2500|$|Tutu {{came out}} in support of {{assisted}} dying on July 2014, stating that life shouldn't be preserved [...] "at any cost". He also said that laws that deny the right to assisted dying deprive those who are dying of their [...] "human right to dignity". He gave the example of Nelson Mandela, whose long and painful illness was in his opinion [...] "an affront to Madiba's dignity". Tutu stated that {{in a similar situation}} he would not want to have his own life [...] "prolonged artificially", saying [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} would be upset if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Amerie {{returned}} to the studio to work on her third album, Because I Love It, enlisting producers such as The Buchanans, One Up, Mike Caren. The album was her first not to feature writing and production from her long-time collaborator, friend, and producer Rich Harrison. She cited music of the 1980s as {{a major influence on}} the album, saying [...] "I love 80's music period! That's why I did Because I Love It, since it had mostly R, soul, and 80's new wave. When <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do that in 2006, people were like, 'what?!' [...] but I love it." [...] "Take Control", which was co-produced by Mike Caren, Amerie and Nicholson and co-written by Amerie along with Cee-Lo Green, became a top 10 hit in the UK in mid 2007. Because I Love It was released on May 14, 2007, in Europe, Asia and Australasia, reaching the top 20 in the UK, where the album's second single, [...] "Gotta Work", reached number 21.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} this {{connection}} by Gaenszle in 1992, Regmi said, [...] "I said: look, I dont know, I get paid for doing research on Nepal, I dont care where the money comes from….They gave me a grant, they never told me what to do. They said: You (can) do what you <b>want</b> to do. And <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do land tenure and taxation in Nepal. It started with a one volume project, one became two, two became three, three became four. So they financed all that." [...] The Institutes grant for Regmi was discontinued in 1969 when the Himalayan borders project was scrapped. However Regmi continued to cherish his friendship with Rose long after this controversy and thanked him on numerous occasions in many of his books for the support given.|$|R
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'hey <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him and then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> also <b>want</b> it to be (a) one take … and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the ending shot to look like this, And I described those two things to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|R

There was a wild consultation, and afterwards a hurrying to and fro and a feverish gathering up of razors from obscure places and a ransacking for soap. Next they took us into a little mean, shabby back room; they got two ordinary sitting-room chairs and placed us in them with our coats on. My old, old dream of bliss vanished into thin air! ...|$|E
