25|$|The King and noblemen, {{as well as}} high officials, had {{the right}} to receive {{conveyance}} from farmers. The right was never a <b>formal</b> <b>right,</b> but rather a consequence of the ‘conveyance duty’ which was imposed on farmers. Conveyance duty (Norwegian: skyssplikt) is known since the 12th century and functioned as indirect taxation. In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which conveyance farmers had was abolished at the same time.|$|E
500|$|As {{an elected}} body, the Parliament began to draft {{proposals}} addressing {{the functioning of}} the EU. For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the [...] "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" [...] (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties. Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any <b>formal</b> <b>right</b> to veto.|$|E
500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the <b>formal</b> <b>right</b> to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E

2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a <b>formal</b> <b>right</b> to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I think the president has the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Formal</b> and {{effective}} <b>rights</b> {{refers to the}} distinction between the theoretical rights of legalism and the measurable rights within implemented policies. It is argued that the gap between the two concepts stems from the difficulties in realising the theoretical concepts into manageable effective rights. Also, while there is a greater consensus regarding the <b>formal</b> <b>rights,</b> due partly on diplomacy motives, the actual implementation process is much more complex.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} {{of the right to}} health {{is that it is not}} feasible. Imre J.P.

Instead, Loefler suggests that the goal of improving population health is better served through socioeconomic policy than a <b>formal</b> <b>right</b> to health.|$|E

50|$|The Council {{consisted}} of noblemen who were appointed {{either by the}} king or their peers on the Council. Until the 1536 Reformation, bishops were automatically members.

The “backbenchers” of the council took part in daily negotiations of problems and administration, voted, and took on diplomatic tasks. Most of them were squires who also had to look after their lands.|$|E

The Great Powers tacitly recognized the fait accompli by the act of lowering their flags from the Souda fortress on 14 February 1913, and by the Treaty of London in May 1913, Sultan Mehmed V relinquished his <b>formal</b> <b>rights</b> to the island.|$|R
50|$|Interpellation is the <b>formal</b> <b>right</b> of a {{parliament}} to submit formal {{questions to the}} government. In many parliaments, each individual member of parliament {{has the right to}} formally submit questions (possibly a limited amount during a certain period) to a member of government. The respective minister or secretary is then required to respond and to justify government policy. Interpellation thus allows the {{parliament to}} supervise the government's activity. In this sense, it is closer to a motion of censure. In English, the parliamentary questioning sense of 'interpellation' dates from the late 19th century. It has been adopted from French constitutional discourse.|$|E

This decree reduced the headings by which subjects could be summarily punished to 24; later this was further reduced to 12. Maximum fines decreased from 25 francs to 15, and summary imprisonment was capped at five days. In practice, though, summary punishment continued {{at the discretion of}} local authorities. In French-controlled Cameroon, during 1935 there were 32,858 prison sentences for these 'administrative' offenses, compared to 3,512 for common law offenses.|$|E

40|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, increasing attention is being directed {{to the need to}} improve water rights systems. This paper is based on a recent study undertaken to investigate challenges facing optimal implementation of <b>formal</b> water <b>rights</b> systems for irrigation purposes in the Great Ruaha River Catchment in Tanzania. The study integrated social survey, hydrologic, water abstraction and water use data, and Geographical Information System techniques. The results showed that all the canals studied, except one, abstracted water throughout the year, provided there was water in the rivers irrespective of the conditions spelt out in their <b>formal</b> water <b>rights.</b> The <b>formal</b> water <b>rights</b> were also found to be problematic as the quantities to be abstracted were much higher compared to the actual water requirements and the actual river flows. This resulted in over-abstraction of water and increased water shortages for downstream users. The study concludes that although <b>formal</b> water <b>rights</b> are meant to control and regulate the use of water, they are also subject to abuse if not managed and monitored closely. The basin authorities in Tanzania therefore need to be equipped adequately and collaborate more closely with local water users in order to attain high levels of supervision and monitoring essential for optimal implementation of <b>formal</b> water <b>rights</b> systems. ...|$|R

These cities were typically located in small territories where the ruler was weak. They were nevertheless the exception among the multitude of territorial towns and cities.
