5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen {{watching}} the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair.

5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek {{gets up from}} <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> starts {{leaving out}} the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two {{set out to find}} out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Spooner, alone, stands from <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{attempts}} to leave, {{but the door}} is locked. Briggs soon enters to deliver Spooner food and champagne, rambling on about how he met Foster and ignoring Spooner's desire {{to know why the}} door was locked. Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} appearance in London was opposite Agnes Nicholls, in Wallfahrt nach Kevlaar by Engelbert Humperdinck at the St James's Hall, with the Handel Society under J. S. Liddle in late April 1903, and immediately afterwards he {{appeared at the}} Westmorland Festival. In June 1903 he was auditioned at the Royal College of Music in London by Charles Villiers Stanford, who left the room and brought Hubert Parry in to hear him as well. The violinist Professor Kruse, who was then attempting to revive the Saturday 'Pops' at the St James's Hall jumped out of <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> promptly engaged him, and it was Kruse who arranged for his first appearance in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius early in 1904 as an addition to his Beethoven Festival. Harry Plunket Greene, who had encouraged Elwes through this audition, also remained his lifelong friend.|$|E

25|$|As she {{approaches}} the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through {{the reflection of}} his drink. As she comes into the castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast {{sits in a chair}} (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E
25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up from <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin walk back to the manor together.|$|E
500|$|In 1920 Znaniecki {{returned}} to the newly established Second Polish Republic, where at Poznań University he soon became Poland's first chair in sociology. He accomplished this by renaming the department, originally [...] "Third Philosophical Department", to [...] "Department of Sociology and Cultural Philosophy", doing the same for <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> establishing a [...] Sociological Seminary. [...] That same year he also founded the Polish Institute of Sociology (Polski Instutut Socjologiczny), the fifth-oldest sociological institute in Europe.|$|E

Lincoln slumped over in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> then fell backward. Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like [...] "Freedom!" ...|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{the first}} of two music videos {{released}} by NBC on YouTube in advance of the episode's air date [...] the other being [...] "Everything Comes Down To Poo". The videos have since been removed from YouTube. In addition, the night before [...] "My Musical" [...] aired, actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and after an interview with the host, Braff grabbed a hand held microphone that was hidden in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the two began singing [...] "Guy Love". The song also appeared in [...] "My Road to Nowhere", as Turk's cell phone ring tone for Carla, and as an arranged incidental version in [...] "My Words of Wisdom", and was played as background music while Turk and J.D. hugged in [...] "My Comedy Show". The song was also used in the season 9 premiere [...] "Our First Day of School." ...|$|E

500|$|Fincher {{was drawn}} to this story because {{he spent much of}} his {{childhood}} in San Anselmo in Marin County during the initial Zodiac murders. [...] "I remember coming home and saying the highway patrol had been following our school buses for a couple weeks now. [...] And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, turned slowly in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E
500|$|The canvas is {{dramatically}} divided in two by a diagonal line separated by colour and tone. The lower two-thirds {{are dominated by}} heavy red and white pigments; browns and whites are prominent in the upper right-hand section. This division is delineated by a diagonal reaching from the upper edge of the curtain down to Ottavio's leggings in the right mid-ground. Other echoes of the colours and patterns include the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the overhanging curtain. This dramatic colour and luminosity can be in part attributed to this design, and to {{the manner in which}} Titian reverses the usual painterly technique in building tone: he began with a dark background, then layered the lighter hues before the darker passages. The effect {{has been described as a}} [...] "tour de force of symphonic colourism", and a high point of his blending of red and ochre pigments. Titian uses a variety of brushstrokes. While the pope's robes are painted with very broad strokes, his cape (mozzetta), ageing face and visible hand were captured in minute detail with thin brushes, with his hairs rendered at the level of individual strands.|$|E
500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped out of <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{ran out of the}} room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm just glad he didn't get up and leave because then I would have been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, 1970, John Norman Collins was {{unanimously}} {{found guilty}} of the first-degree murder of Karen Sue Beineman; he remained impassive upon hearing the jury foreman announce the verdict, although many spectators gasped audibly, and his mother and sister left the courtroom in tears. Formal sentencing was scheduled for 8:30a.m. August 28. On this date, Collins was formally sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Prior to his passing sentence, Judge Conlin asked Collins if he wished {{to address the court}} before mandatory life sentencing was imposed.
