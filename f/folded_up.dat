5|$|Jackson {{assisted}} Clair Brothers by teaming with Ron Borthwick {{to design}} a mixing console that <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> into its own road case, a proprietary model used by Clair Brothers for some 12 years of top tours. The console used novel plasma bargraph meters which displayed both average and peak sound levels, combining the characteristics of fast peak meters and slower VU meters. Clair Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound console to incorporate parametric equalisation.|$|E
5|$|Shen's largest atlas {{included}} twenty three maps of China {{and foreign}} regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen {{also created a}} raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.

5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria. This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.|$|E

5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E
5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and may already have been an antique {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E

Australia in reply scored 659/4 with Michael Clarke scoring a triple century (329 not out), Michael Hussey scoring 150 not out and Ricky Ponting scoring 134.

25|$|Several {{people on}} the ground {{witnessed}} the final moments of flight 240. The consensus of their evidence was that the stricken plane was lower than usual compared with other aircraft approaching East Midlands, and that it was losing altitude as well as oscillating in both pitch and roll. As it regained level attitude, both wings <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> almost simultaneously and became detached from the fuselage, along with other parts of the structure.|$|E

GC troopers continued to wear aluminium badges of rank, which were worn on the right sleeve, 11.5 centimetres below the right shoulder strap. Constables wore aluminium bars at the outer edges of the shoulder straps. The dark blue trousers were secured by the two-pronged black leather Garrison Belt, and completed by standard-issued black leather boots.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Dr P. Vadarajulu Naidu, who was {{conducting}} a Tamil news-cum-views weekly ‘Tamil Nadu’ started a daily {{with the same}} name. Its forceful and colluqial style gained it a wide readership but after the paper failed to take sides with the 1930 Civil Disobedience Movement, the Congress Party decided to bring out a new Tamil daily- India, edited by renowned poet Subramania Bharati. India showed great promise but could not establish itself financially, and <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> soon after Bharati was exiled to Pondicherry. All these papers were published from Madras.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{handcuffs}} {{have traditionally}} been advantageous when the arresting officer has {{to try to keep}} the suspect under control, there has been increasing complaint from officers that standard cuffs are bulky and inconvenient to carry. Hiatt developed a handcuff known as 'Rigid Folding Handcuffs' which work on the basis that they 'click' into place, staying rigid. It can be <b>folded</b> <b>up,</b> so they can be put on a belt or in a pocket. In the UK, undercover police have been known to use these covertly. They are roughly one and a half time the price of normal handcuffs.|$|E

25|$|On 23 May 1950, Vickers {{test pilot}} Les Colquhoun was flying the first {{production}} Attacker F.1 WA469. He was carrying out high speed tests when {{during one of}} the tests the outer portion of the starboard wing <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> and the ailerons became locked. Colquhoun decided not to eject and managed to do a high-speed landing at Chilbolton, in the course of which he used all but the last 100 yards (90m) of the runway and burst a tyre.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the German Army had an {{interest}} in a small helicopter for observation and communications duties that could be <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> compactly enough to be carried in a trailer pulled by a jeep. The Do 32, like several other light helicopters of the time such as the Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter and the Sud-Ouest Djinn, used rotor tip jets to drive the rotor blades. The advantage of tip drive is the absence of torque reaction, making a tail rotor unnecessary, saving weight and simplifying control of the aircraft. Dornier used a small gas turbine to drive a compressor, which fed air out through tubes in the rotors to the tips.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night sleeping in his seat on a train trip from Buffalo to Westfield, New York, George Pullman was inspired to design an improved passenger railcar that contained sleeper berths for all its passengers. During the day, the upper berth was <b>folded</b> <b>up</b> somewhat like a modern airliner's overhead luggage compartment. At night the upper berth folded down and the two facing seats below it folded over to provide a relatively comfortable bunk for the night. Although this was somewhat spartan accommodation by today's standards, {{it was a great}} improvement on the previous layout. Curtains provided privacy, and there were washrooms {{at each end of the}} car for men and women.|$|E
