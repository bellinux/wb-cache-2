Such knowledge is essential for optimizing implant materials, identifying patients who are possibly at risk of implant loosening, and proving the concepts of current joint simulators. An instrumented hip implant with telemetric data transfer was developed to measure the implant temperatures in vivo. A clinical study with 100 patients is planned to measure the implant temperatures for different combinations of head and cup materials during walking. This study will answer the question of whether patients with synovia with poor lubricating properties may be at risk for thermally induced bone necrosis and subsequent implant failure. The study will also deliver the different friction properties of various implant materials and prove the significance of wear simulator tests. A clinically successful titanium hip endoprosthesis was modified to house the electronics inside its hollow neck. The electronics are powered by an external induction coil fixed around the joint. A temperature sensor inside the implant triggers a timer circuit, which produces an <b>inductive</b> <b>pulse</b> train with temperature-dependent intervals.

The implant temperature is measured with an accuracy of 0. 1 °C in a range between 20 °C and 58 °C and at a sampling rate of 2 - 10 Hz. This rate could be considerably increased for measuring other data, such as implant strain or vibration.

40|$|<b>Inductive</b> <b>Pulsed</b> Plasma Thruster (IPPT) pulse circuits, such {{as those}} needed to operate the <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Inductive</b> Thruster (PIT), are {{required}} to quickly switch capacitor banks operating at a period of s while conducting current at levels {{on the order of}} at least 10 kA. [1, 2] For all iterations of the PIT to date, spark gaps have been used to discharge the capacitor bank through an inductive coil. Recent availability of fast, highpower solid state switching devices makes it possible to consider the use of semiconductor switches in modern IPPTs. In addition, novel preionization schemes have led to a reduction in discharge energy per pulse for electric thrusters of this type, relaxing the switching requirements for these thrusters. [3, 4] Solid state switches offer the advantage of greater controllability and reliability, as well as decreased drive circuit dimensions and mass relative to spark gap switches. The use of solid state devices such as Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), Gate Turnoff Thyristors (GTOs) and SiliconControlled Rectifiers (SCRs) often involves the use of power diodes. These semiconductor devices may be connected antiparallel to the switch for protection from reverse current, or used to reduce power loss in a circuit by clamping off current ringing. In each case, higher circuit efficiency may be achieved by using a diode that is able to transition, or 'switch,' from the forward conducting state ('on' state) to the reverse blocking state ('off' state) in the shortest amount of time, thereby minimizing current ringing and switching losses. Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diodes offer significant advantages to conventional fastswitching Silicon (Si) diodes for high power and fast switching applications. A wider band gap results in a breakdown voltage 10 times that of Si, so that a SiC device may have a thinner drift region for a given blocking voltage. [5] This leads to smaller, lighter devices for high voltage applications, as well as reduced forward conduction losses, faster reverse recovery time (faster turnoff), and lowermagnitude reverse recovery current. In addition, SiC devices have lower leakage current as compared to their Si counterparts, and a high thermal conductivity, potentially allowing the former to operate at higher temperatures with a smaller, lighter heatsink (or no heatsink at all) ...|$|R

A conventional Si FRD from ABB and a prototype Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diode from Cree, Inc. were characterized and tested as part of an IPPT solid state switching module on the Flat-Plate Thruster (FPT) developed and constructed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Electric Propulsion Thruster Development Laboratory. Preliminary analytical characterization of the devices, including static performance, dynamic (switching) performance, and thermal analysis is described, as well as the construction of the FPT thruster and the experimental setup used for thruster switching data collection.
