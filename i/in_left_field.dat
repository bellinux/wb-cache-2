5|$|In 1880, Sunday {{relocated}} to Marshalltown, Iowa, where, {{because of his}} athleticism, he had been recruited for a fire brigade team. In Marshalltown, Sunday worked at odd jobs, competed in fire brigade tournaments, and played for the town baseball team. In 1882, with Sunday <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13–4.|$|E
5|$|Musberger's call, {{dramatic}} as it was, incorrectly implied that Bernie Williams fielded the double in left. Bernie was playing center {{field at the}} time. Gerald Williams was <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> playing the ball and making the late throw back to the infield.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{endured a}} knee injury, {{multiple}} surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field.</b> In his return against the San Diego Padres, he nearly {{hit a home}} run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4. Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.|$|E

5|$|Larry Schmittou {{sold his}} {{majority}} {{interest in the}} Sounds to Al Gordon, president of AmeriSports Companies LLC, before the 1997 season. The new ownership group refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This brought the seating capacity to 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{continued}} {{to tinker with}} his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field.</b> However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{his first}} full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first). Until that time, he was {{primarily}} a third baseman, though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field.</b> Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Ishikawa {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and {{defensive}} replacement. Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. In 2014, he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However his bat wasn't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April and started for them <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> during the 2014 playoffs. On October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} Belt to first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during the 2014 postseason.|$|E

5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field.</b> Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E
5|$|The {{off-season}} the Phillies promoted {{assistant general}} manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. to general manager, succeeding Pat Gillick who retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract. Their most notable offseason player change was <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> as Pat Burrell departed due to free agency and was replaced by free agent Raúl Ibañez. Another notable acquisition was free agent pitcher Chan Ho Park. Park was originally signed as a backup option for the bullpen, as reliever J. C. Romero was assigned a 50-game suspension after violating the Major League Baseball drug policy, but Park won the fifth starter's job in Spring Training.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home {{run of the}} spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition against the Bears. Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted {{for all of the}} Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the New York Giants, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the eighth}} inning, with one out and two men on base, Red Sox closer Foulke came in to pitch. Édgar Rentería singled towards Ramírez <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> who unintentionally kicked the ball away, {{allowing}} Jason Marquis to score. Walker also hit the ball towards Ramírez in the next at bat. Ramírez slid in an attempt to try to catch the ball, but tripped and deflected the ball for his second error in two plays, and the fourth Red Sox error in the game. Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky's Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead. In the ninth inning, Foulke struck out Cedeño to win the game for the Red Sox 11–9.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field,</b> and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} several areas {{reserved}} for {{small and large}} groups. Four field-level suites, each with 33exterior seats and additional interior space to accommodate 22people, are located directly behind home plate.

Two covered party decks are located on the second level—one at each end—both of which can accommodate up to 75people each. Between {{the end of the}} lower seating bowl <b>in</b> <b>left</b> <b>field</b> and the outfield berm lies a group area which can accommodate up to 600individuals. This area consists of a covered picnic area, round picnic tables, rearrangeable chairs, and stadium seats.
