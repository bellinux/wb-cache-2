6000|$|... "All over!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>with</b> {{his eyes}} looking beyond her. [...] "I reckon--I'm glad.... But y'u can--do somethin' for or me. Will y'u?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Alma set her drawing {{against the}} wall, in rising to say goodnight to Fulkerson. He bent {{over on his}} stick to look at it. [...] "Well, it's beautiful," [...] <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>with</b> {{unconscious}} sincerity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! {{that is an}} idea! Of {{course there}} are. I knew you'd see me through. We'll defeat them yet. Hi, pup!... He's gone. Absolutely disappeared!' <b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief, and I caught the lucky moment.|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> <b>with</b> {{relief when}} she parts from him; Her proud head held in its black silk scarf Gone under the archway, home, he can join The men that lounge {{in a group}} on the wharf.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} is;' but <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> heavily, <b>with</b> {{a sense that}} it was almost profanation to have set such a {{profession}} in the balance against the sacred ministry.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighed,</b> and <b>with</b> that <b>sigh</b> {{went all}} his regrets {{for the life}} which had once seemed to him so greatly to be desired. He {{recognised}} in those few seconds the ignominy of peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} go," [...] <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> comic emphasis. [...] "My teachings don't {{seem to have}} {{improved}} your powers of reasoning. You are {{as bad as the}} police. Lady Donaldson has been robbed and murdered, and you immediately argue that she was robbed and murdered by the same person." ...|$|E
60|$|Already <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> {{the stress}} of care, the press of thought, which came upon him. The longing uneasiness of the boy had given place to another unrest--the unrest {{of the man who}} must face the world in earnest now, {{planning}} for food and shelter; and all plans included Maud.|$|E
60|$|He {{was proud}} of him! He could not but feel that in similar {{circumstances}} he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his replies, but his instinct told him that this taciturnity was the very thing. <b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief, however, when Soames, slowly turning, and without any change of expression, descended from the box.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it!" [...] yelled Jukes, so {{that every}} head on the Nan-Shan's decks looked towards the bridge. Then <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> and <b>with</b> sudden resignation: [...] "It would {{certainly}} be a dam' distressful sight," [...] he said, meekly.|$|R
60|$|At Queenstown {{one of my}} new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, {{and when}} I said {{something}} about the Lakes of Killarney, <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> and sung, <b>with</b> a look at me...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear boy, no, I have an {{assistant}} already," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> this time <b>with</b> genuine emotion. [...] "If {{you come here}} {{you will have to}} stand upon your own legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With all {{the other}} things?" [...] His face, while he sounded mine, seemed to say that I must then take his {{expectation}} as serious. But it seemed to say also that he was--definitely, yes--more at a loss than consorted with being quite sure of me. [...] "Well, {{it will make a}} lot, really----!" [...] But he broke off. [...] "You do," [...] <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> an effort at resignation, [...] "know more than I!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{long black}} mole slid past, the bows forged more {{slowly through the}} crystal brine, and the harbor opened up. Even before the yellow flag fluttered aloft, boats by the dozen shot out from the lava steps, and Dane eagerly scanned the faces of their occupants. They were fruit peddlers, {{shipping}} and coaling clerks, and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> disappointment as he next swept his eyes along the mole. Nobody among the loungers there raised a hat or a handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|Desmond laughed, and {{slipping}} {{his hand}} beneath the inquirer's arm strolled aft with him, but <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief when, as {{they joined the}} others {{on the opposite side}} of the deck-house, he saw Benicia already sitting there. He did not know how she had contrived it, until he remembered that to slip through the companion would shorten the distance. It was, however, half an hour later when she found an opportunity of standing beside him for a moment or two.|$|E
5000|$|Chen's {{considerable}} {{military and}} tactical abilities prompted the Qing authorities {{to offer him}} a post. However Chen declined the offerï¼Ž Before he was executed, <b>he</b> reportedly <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> emotion saying, [...] "I worried that the Taiping will lose whole areas of northern Yangtze River after I die!". Unluckily for the Taiping rebels, his last words came true.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps he divined {{what was}} passing in her mind. His whole {{attitude}} {{was one of}} intense longing--a veritable prayer for that confidence, which her foolish pride withheld from him. When she remained silent <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> and said <b>with</b> marked coldness-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God forbid," [...] {{said the}} colonel, and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> again, <b>with</b> {{his eyes fixed}} upon the fire. Eames {{had heard of the}} very gallant way in which Orlando Dale had persisted in running away with Lord De Guest's sister, in {{opposition}} to very terrible obstacles, and as he now looked at the intrepid lover, he thought that {{there must have been a}} great change since those days. After that nothing more was said till the earl came down.|$|R
6000|$|... "You remember, Madame Pratolungo, I took {{high ground}} {{in this matter}} from the first. I protested against the {{proceedings}} of the man Grosse, as involving a purely worldly interference with the ways of an inscrutable Providence. With what effect? My paternal influence was repudiated; my Moral Weight was, so to speak, set aside. And now you see the result. Take it to heart, dear friend. May it be a warning to you!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> ponderous complacency, and turned from me to the girl behind the counter. [...] "I will take another cup of tea." ...|$|E
60|$|Spring was {{the worst}} time. He was changeable, and intense and cruel. So he decided {{to stay away from}} her. Then came the hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him. His mother watched him growing restless. He could not go on with his work. He could do nothing. It was as if {{something}} were drawing his soul out towards Willey Farm. Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing. And his mother knew he was gone. And {{as soon as he was}} on the way <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief. And when he was with her he was cruel again.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> troubled {{gaze and}} grumbled an oath. [...] "I don't {{know what to}} think of him! He gits me." [...] And in that rather mournful spirit he went about his work, leaving the whole matter of the {{marriage}} festival {{in the hands of the}} women. In a dim way he still felt that haste was necessary, although Fan's face was as joyous, as careless, and as innocent as a child's. As she galloped about the country with her George Adelbert she sowed her [...] "bids" [...] broadcast, as if wishing all the world to share her happiness. There was nothing exclusive, or shrinking, or parsimonious in Frances Blondell.|$|E
60|$|A {{hundred yards}} more {{and we came}} to the little cottage nigh hid among the trees. John Paul paused a moment, his hand upon the latch of the gate, his eyes {{drinking}} in the familiar picture. The light of day was dying behind Criffel, and the tiny panes of the cottage windows pulsed with the rosy flame on the hearth within, now flaring, and again deepening. <b>He</b> <b>sighed.</b> <b>He</b> walked <b>with</b> unsteady step to the door and pushed it open. I followed, scarce knowing what I did, halted at the threshold and drew back, for I had been upon holy ground.|$|R
50|$|Valeri Tushentsov is the {{graduate}} of Karagandy ice hockey school. He {{started his career}} as a player of Stroitel Karagandy in 1993. In 1995, he invited to play in Kazakhstan National Hockey Team and played 7 games with them. In 1997, <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> a contract <b>with</b> Mechel Chelyabinsk and played in Russia before the end of his career.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{eyes opened}} wider, {{and though it}} was evident that there was not {{complete}} comprehension in them <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> as <b>with</b> a great contentment. Then they closed altogether as he turned his head a trifle on the pillow. The girl did not move, but stood stooping a little, and looking down at him with a great compassion, until {{a man who had been}} watching her nodded unseen to Seaforth as he also bent over the bed. He waited for almost a minute, and then straightened himself wearily as he spoke in a just audible whisper.|$|R
60|$|Sir Marmaduke {{had quickly}} {{arrived at the}} {{conclusion}} that Richard Lambert had seen and spoken to Lady Sue and had learned from {{her that she was}} now irrevocably married to him, whom she always called her prince. Doubtless, the young man was frenzied with grief, and in his weak state of health after the terrible happenings of the past few weeks, would mayhap, either go raving mad, or end his miserable existence over the cliffs. Either eventuality would suit Sir Marmaduke admirably, and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> satisfaction at the thought that the knot between the heiress and himself was indeed tied sufficiently firm now to ensure her obedience to his will.|$|E
60|$|Already <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> {{the stress}} of care, the press of thought, which came upon him. The longing uneasiness of the boy had given place to another unrest--the unrest {{of the man who}} must face the world in earnest now, {{planning}} for food and shelter. To go back to school was out of the question. To expect help from his father, overworked and burdened with debt, was impossible. He must go to work, and go to work to aid her. A living must be wrung from this town. All the home and all the property Mrs. Welsh had were here, and wherever Maud went the mother must follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe in two weeks... or, {{maybe in}} two or three months." [...] <b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> solemn deliberation. [...] "We're like the Irishman with the trunk an' nothin' to put in it. Here's the wagon, here's the horses, an' nothin' to pull. I know a peach of a shotgun I can get, second-hand, {{eighteen}} dollars; but look at the bills we owe. Then there's a new '22 Automatic rifle I want for you. An' a 30-30 I've had my eye on for deer. An' you want a good jointed pole as well as me. An' tackle costs like Sam Hill. An' harness like I want will cost fifty bucks cold. An' the wagon ought to be painted. Then there's pasture ropes, an' nose-bags, an' a harness punch, an' all such things. An' Hazel an' Hattie eatin' their heads off all the time we're waitin'. An' I 'm just itchin' to be started myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{only were}} {{sure she was}} safe," [...] <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> hanging over, <b>with</b> an {{intensity}} of affection and anxiety that brought a dew even to the old steersman's eyes; and he kindly engrossed Eugene by telling about the places they passed, and setting him to watch the smart crew of the boat from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, which was gaining on them.|$|R
6000|$|He {{then took}} up the apple {{and looked at it}} with eyes brimful of tears, for he knew the whole extent of his misfortune. His heart ached, he felt a loathing for the world, and <b>he</b> said <b>with</b> <b>sighs</b> and groans[FN#28]: ...|$|R
60|$|He made {{a breakfast}} which bore ample {{witness to the}} truth of his statement; a meal with long {{intervals}} of conversation. To Hartley, who usually breakfasted in a quarter of an hour, and was anxious to start for the office, it became tedious in the extreme, and his eyes repeatedly sought the clock. <b>He</b> almost <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief as the visitor took the last piece of toast in the rack, only to be plunged again into depression as his daughter rang the bell for more. Unable to endure it any longer he rose and, murmuring something about getting ready, quitted the room.|$|R
60|$|He sat up suddenly, {{threw away}} the bedclothes, from which came {{a puff of}} hot steam, and began to rub his pyjamas against his sides and his legs. He rubbed madly for a few moments. Then <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> relief. He sat {{on the side of}} the bed, moving from the hot {{dampness}} of the place where he had lain. For a moment he thought he would go to sleep. Then, in an instant his brain seemed to click awake. He was still as loath as ever to move, but his brain was no longer clouded in hot vapour: it was clear. He sat, bowing forward {{on the side of the}} bed, his sleeping-jacket open, the dawn stealing into the room, the morning air entering fresh through the wide-flung window-door. He felt a peculiar sense of guilt, of wrongness, in thus having jumped out of bed. It seemed to him as if he ought to have endured the heat of his body, and the infernal trickling of the drops of sweat. But at the thought of it he moved his hands gratefully over his sides, which now were dry, and soft, and smooth; slightly chilled on the surface perhaps, for he felt a sudden tremor of shivering from the warm contact of his hands.|$|E
60|$|Thomas Stevens {{may have}} toyed prodigiously with truth, {{but when we}} first met (it were well to mark this point), he wandered into my camp when I thought myself a {{thousand}} miles beyond the outermost post of civilization. At the sight of his human face, the first in weary months, I could have sprung forward and folded him in my arms (and I am not by any means a demonstrative man); but to him his visit seemed the most casual thing under the sun. He just strolled into the light of my camp, passed the time of day after the custom of men on beaten trails, threw my snowshoes the one way and a couple of dogs the other, and so made room for himself by the fire. Said he'd just dropped in to borrow a pinch of soda and to see if I had any decent tobacco. He plucked forth an ancient pipe, loaded it with painstaking care, and, without as much as by your leave, whacked half the tobacco of my pouch into his. Yes, the stuff was fairly good. <b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> the contentment of the just, and literally absorbed the smoke from the crisping yellow flakes, and it did my smoker's heart good to behold him.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{time the}} shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent amazement. Then he decided, being wise in his way, to take {{advantage}} of his good fortune. He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy clothing, and bathed in the pool with rare enjoyment. After he had dried himself with the soft towels he went into the dressing-room and took fresh linen from the drawers and put it on, finding that everything fitted him exactly. He examined the contents of the closets and selected an elegant suit of clothing. Strangely enough, everything about it was shaggy, although so new and beautiful, and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>with</b> contentment to realize that he could now be finely dressed and still be the Shaggy Man. His coat was of rose-colored velvet, trimmed with shags and bobtails, with buttons of blood-red rubies and golden shags around the edges. His vest was a shaggy satin of a delicate cream color, and his knee-breeches of rose velvet trimmed like the coat. Shaggy creamy stockings of silk, and shaggy slippers of rose leather with ruby buckles, completed his costume, and when he was thus attired the shaggy man looked at himself in a long mirror with great admiration. On a table he found a mother-of-pearl chest decorated with delicate silver vines and flowers of clustered rubies, and on the cover was a silver plate engraved with these words: ...|$|E
50|$|Oleg Bolyakin is the {{graduate}} of Karagandy ice hockey school. He {{started his career}} as a player of Avtomobilist Karagandy in 1981. In 1995, he invited to play in Kazakhstan National Hockey Team and played 3 games with them. In 1996, Avtomobilist Karagandy was disbanded. In 1998, <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> a contract <b>with</b> Amur Khabarovsk, but played only 9 games. From 1999 to 2003, he played for Yuzhny Ural Orsk at the Russian Major League.|$|R
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> <b>with</b> sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|R
50|$|One of Nao's best friends, {{and very}} loyal. She is boy-crazy {{and is very}} {{knowledgeable}} {{when it comes to}} that. She also keeps a book of all the hot boys she knows. Although Marina is very knowledgeable about them, she says she would never go out with anyone she doesn't like. Later in the story, she starts going out with Mi-chan. Usually, once starting to date a boy, she breaks up with him shortly after. Her only serious boyfriend has been and is still Mi-chan. However, when she gets into a fight with him about her hair, she visits him with Nao's advice and sees him with another girl. However, the girl with Mi-chan was someone in his study group. Marina confesses that she knew Mi-chan was not cheating on her but feels insecure about their relationship because she worries that he will establish a new life at his new high school and that he will no longer have room for her and says she may break up with him. He waits for her to tell her that he does not want them to break up and she tells him she was only joking. <b>He</b> <b>sighs</b> <b>with</b> relief and Marina kisses his cheek, ending their fight. She also takes computer classes.|$|R
