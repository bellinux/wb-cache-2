5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> once that he must become an actor.|$|E

5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{villages in}} the {{mountains}} to the south, west, and north of the Salmas Plain were generally smaller, and accounted for about half {{of the total number of}} villages that were lost. The foreshock was not <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> Borusliqalan (the westernmost village that was destroyed) and the losses were high. The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia (and to the southwest of Tabriz) where the village of Mamaqan was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed. Other nearby villages went almost unscathed, with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> odds with it.|$|E

5|$|Marge's absence is <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> home as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny {{with the rest of}} Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus. In the aftermath of the Franco-Turkish accords, Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and the supplier of its food and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> that time to reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, {{it was decided that}} it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in dry and warm weather conditions. Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 38.474 seconds, ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard. Barrichello set the fourth quickest time and caused the session to be yellow flagged when he lost control of his car and spun at the hairpin between turns ten and eleven and crashed into the perimeter fencing. Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella. Frentzen and Jarno Trulli set the seventh and ninth fastest times respectively for Jordan; they were separated by Jaguar's Eddie Irvine. Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR completed the top ten despite spinning off the circuit which caused grass to penetrate his radiators. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:37.728, six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello had trouble selecting first gear on his final run although he set the third quickest time. Coulthard was fourth fastest, ahead of Button. Frentzen and Trulli continued their good form setting the sixth and seventh fastest times. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta completed the top ten fastest drivers. During the session, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale was <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> Suzuka, although no structural damage was reported around the circuit despite mild alarm.|$|E
5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be <b>felt</b> <b>at</b> their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E
