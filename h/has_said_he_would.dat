25|$|In early 2016, Lula was {{appointed}} Chief of Staff under Rousseff, but Justice Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court blocked the appointment due to ongoing federal investigations. In Brasil the presidential {{chief of staff}} is a cabinet-level position that requires charges of malfeasance to be tried in a special court. On 12 July 2017, the former president was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. He was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sérgio Moro but remains free pending an appeal of the sentence; if the court upholds Moro's decision, Lula would be ineligible {{to run in the}} 2018 presidential election as he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E

De La Hoya has been seen wearing Dynamo colors on his boxing uniform with a small Houston Dynamo logo on his right leg in a fight against boxer Steve Forbes.

[...] However, he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide, and would not support a federal ban.|$|E

2500|$|After this success, Warner Bros. hired Schumacher {{to direct}} a sequel, Batman & Robin, in 1997. The film did not perform as well {{at the box office}} as its predecessors, and was a {{critical}} failure; it is frequently considered {{to be one of the}} worst films ever made. Warner Bros. subsequently put the Batman movie series on hiatus for several years, canceling Schumacher's next planned Batman movie, Batman Unchained. On the DVD commentary, Schumacher has admitted that his movie disappointed fans of darker Batman adaptations, saying that the film was made intentionally marketable (or [...] "toyetic") and kid-friendly. He claims to have been under heavy pressure from the studio to do so; however, he admits full responsibility and, at one point, apologizes to any fans who were disappointed. Schumacher is a devoted Batman fan himself, and <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have personally preferred an adaptation of the comic [...]|$|E

It has a special responsibility to use its power with care and to support international efforts to resolve conflicts collectively and peacefully". He has also said that US President, Donald Trump, [...] "seems determined {{to add to the}} dangers [...] by recklessly escalating the confrontation with North Korea, unilaterally launching missile strikes on Syria, opposing President Obama’s nuclear arms deal with Iran and backing a new nuclear arms race." [...] Following Trump's withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, {{he said it was a}} [...] "very big shame", further saying that [...] "Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate change deal is reckless and dangerous".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Ahern <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have no {{difficulties}} giving {{evidence to}} the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large {{we all know what}} happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened. I don’t think it will take too long [...] to write up what the position is." [...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that {{one of the first things}} that Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ray is head chef at The Queen Victoria, is in a {{relationship}} with Kat's friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and is trusted by Alfie, of which Inside Soap said an affair [...] "seems unimaginable, but might he surprise us with his actions?" [...] They called Ray [...] "eye candy" [...] for Kat, saying [...] "it's never a bad thing" [...] for her, and noted that she appreciates him as her head chef. For Kat to have an affair with Ray would not only mean betraying Alfie but also Kim. They felt that Ray was the most obvious choice, and had not yet had a major storyline, and an affair would shock viewers and have a big impact on Ray's family life. They also said that they would not blame Kat for an affair with Ray as he is [...] "gorgeous, sensitive and has a six-pack to die for". Soaplife opined that Ray was the [...] "red herring", as actor Venn <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like Ray to marry Kim and start a family, and later said that all hints were pointing to Ray, so [...] "it would be no kind of mystery if it is him." [...] All About Soap said that Ray's [...] "flirty banter with Kat has sent her into a spin", but were not sure Ray would be the one having the affair, especially after Kat picks Alfie for the football team over Ray, and made him joint third most likely, along with Derek. The magazine later opined that [...] "lovely" [...] Ray would not have it in him to cheat, but thought he may have tired of Kim's behaviour. Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father, but we all have our dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way..." [...] Venn also said, [...] "I would love it to be me—for the drama, of course. Why not? You can just imagine the kind of drama which would ensue with Kim. It'd be fight of the century, that one. Dynasty would have nothing on this!" [...] Venn also {{said in an interview that}} he was looking forward to kissing scenes with Wallace, implying that Ray could be Kat's lover. Ray was the first of the five suspects to be eliminated, on 7 August 2012.|$|E
