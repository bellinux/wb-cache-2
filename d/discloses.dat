40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{experience}} significant discrimination within American society. As a result of discrimination, MSM are at elevated risk for a number of health problems, such as substance use. MSM do not always <b>disclose</b> sexual identity/behavior to health care providers. Non-disclosure to medical providers can negatively impact health for MSM, such as elevated risk for contracting HIV. Reasons for non-disclosure include fear of provider rejection and perceived provider discomfort with discussing sexuality. The purpose of the present study is to examine factors that influence disclosure to medical providers. Eighty-seven participants were recruited through social media and LGBT-friendly organizations. These participants completed a quasi-experimental study of factors that influence disclosure/non-disclosure. These participants endorsed <b>disclosing</b> to primary care physicians and not <b>disclosing</b> to dentists most frequently. In addition, participants who <b>disclose</b> to providers in general endorsed more reasons to <b>disclose</b> than not to <b>disclose.</b> However, participants who did not <b>disclose</b> in general did not report more reasons to not <b>disclose</b> than to <b>disclose.</b> Across different types of providers, the majority of participants indicated they <b>disclosed</b> due to perceived need for the provider to know sexual orientation/same-sex behavior. These findings provide insight into multiple factors that influence disclosure and non-disclosure to different types of health care providers...|$|R
