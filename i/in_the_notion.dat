25|$|The ancient idea of melancholia still survives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a melancholic subtype. The new {{definitions}} of depression were widely accepted, albeit with some conflicting findings and views, and the nomenclature continues in DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} concerning corporeity connects {{also with}} Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (l'espace) and {{the primacy of}} the dimension of depth (la profondeur) as implied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of being in the world (être au monde; to echo Heidegger's In-der-Welt-sein) and of one's own body (le corps propre).|$|E

25|$|Even the {{indirect}} reference to types implicit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of stratification can be eliminated.

25|$|Interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of {{a snowball}} Earth {{increased}} dramatically after Paul F.

Berry has written at least twenty-five books (or chapbooks) of poems, sixteen volumes of essays, and eleven novels and short story collections.

25|$|The CCI {{model is}} {{independent}} of document types or data models, operation types, or supporting techniques (OT, multi-versioning, serialization, undo/redo). It was not intended for correctness verification for techniques (e.g. OT) that are designed for specific data and operation models and for specific applications. <b>In,</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of intention preservation was defined and refined at three levels: First, it {{was defined as a}} generic consistency requirement for collaborative editing systems; Second, it was defined as operation context-based pre- and post- transformation conditions for generic OT functions; Third, it was defined as specific operation verification criteria to guide the design of OT functions for two primitive operations: string-wise insert and delete, in collaborative plain text editors.|$|E
500|$|With Watchmen, Alan Moore's {{intention}} was to create four or five [...] "radically opposing ways" [...] to perceive {{the world and to}} give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of [...] " [...] regurgitated morals" [...] down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, [...] "What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{significance}} of the Gallipoli Campaign is felt strongly in both New Zealand and Australia, despite their being {{a small minority of}} the Allied forces; the campaign is regarded in both nations as a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and had been linked to their emergence as independent states. Approximately 50,000 Australians served at Gallipoli and from 14,000 to 17,000 New Zealanders. It has been argued that the campaign proved significant in the emergence of a unique Australian identity following the war, which has been closely linked to popular conceptualisations of the qualities of the soldiers that fought during the campaign, which became embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of an [...] "Anzac spirit".|$|E

500|$|Matrices can be {{generalized}} in different ways. Abstract algebra uses matrices with entries in more general fields or even rings, while linear algebra codifies properties of matrices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of linear maps. It {{is possible to}} consider matrices with infinitely many columns and rows. Another extension are tensors, which {{can be seen as}} higher-dimensional arrays of numbers, as opposed to vectors, which can often be realised as sequences of numbers, while matrices are rectangular or two-dimensional arrays of numbers. Matrices, subject to certain requirements tend to form groups known as matrix groups. Similarly under certain conditions matrices form rings [...] known as matrix rings. Though the product of matrices is not in general commutative yet certain matrices form fields known as matrix fields.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} in architectural criticism {{have investigated the}} relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place. Feminists in particular, such as Margrit Kennedy, perceive high-rise phallic-like buildings on the urban landscape as [...] "phallic symbols of male domination, power and rational instrumentality." [...] Esther M. K. Cheung believes the form of monumental high-rise building which grew up in 20th century America can [...] "be read as a phallic symbol of power". [...] The present trend symbolises [...] "Science and technology over nature, [...] incorporating all the maleness which that with sci-fi utopias." [...] Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying [...] "not so much {{the dominance of the}} phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is not so much to eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject." [...] Marc C. Taylor discusses phallic architecture and what makes a building masculine or feminine in his book Disfiguring: Art, Architecture, Religion.|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Howard Gordon was originally working on an episode about someone {{who appeared to be}} immortal, but after discussions with consulting producer Ken Horton he added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of xenophobia and [...] "melanin-sucking albino vampires". Series creator Chris Carter approved the storyline, but the first draft of the script was met with disapproval by the writing staff, and the story was restructured and rewritten. As the episode entered pre-production, Carter asked Gordon to refine the script to give it a purpose, and it was then that Gordon came up with the theme of [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate". This phrase is first spoken by Scully in conversation with Mulder after the post mortem on Owen Sanders, the fourth missing man. Mulder later throws the same phrase back at her in frustration as he leaves the Mt Zion Medical Center (where Aboah has been examined) to meet Diabra, the Burkinabe diplomat. And Scully finally uses the phrase in her field journal during her closing sentiments.|$|E

2500|$|Medieval Christian {{cosmology}} shows {{its influence}} {{especially in the}} account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord.

2500|$|In {{his book}} Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Appiah {{introduces}} two ideas that [...] "intertwine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of cosmopolitanism" [...] (Emerging, 69).

The second idea is that we should never take for granted the value of life and become informed of the practices and beliefs of others. Kwame Appiah frequents university campuses to speak to students.

2500|$|The {{notion of}} {{critical}} understanding {{is closely related}} to the concept of Critical Thinking, described as, ‘reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do.’ Critical thinking has also been described as, ‘thinking about thinking’, specifically in relation to John Dewey’s work on ‘the problem of training thought’. Critical understanding has its roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of pluralism, the idea of multiple approaches, methods and interpretations in which dialogue plays an important role. In a pedagogical sense it is closely linked to the theory of Education for Critical Consciousness, outlined by Paulo Freire, Brazilian educator and critical theorist, who wrote, ‘Only dialogue, which requires critical thinking, is also capable of generating critical thinking. Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education.’ ...|$|E
