Particle growth behavior of the 3 lactose grades was evaluated in a <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer.</b> Compactibility and porosity of the resulting granules were also evaluated. A uniaxial compression test on moist agglomerates of the 3 lactose grades was performed in an attempt to explain the mechanism of particle size effect observed in the <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer.</b> Particle growth of anhydrous lactose in the <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> was inversely related to the particle size of the starting material. In addition, granulation manufactured using the grade with the smallest particle size was more porous and demonstrated enhanced compactibility compared with the other grades. Compacts with similar porosity and low liquid saturation demonstrated brittle behavior and their breakage strength was inversely related to lactose particle size in the uniaxial compression test, suggesting that material with smaller particle size may exhibit more pronounced nucleation behavior during wet granulation. On the other hand, compacts prepared at higher liquid saturation and similar compression force exhibited more plastic behavior and showed lower yield stress for the grade with smallest particle size. The lower yield stress of compacts prepared with this grade may indicate a higher coalescence tendency for its granules during wet granulation...|$|E
40|$|Wet granule {{breakage}} is {{a significant}} mechanism, particularly in <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> granulation. This paper presents {{a study of the}} wet breakage mechanism using a Breakage Only Granulator. Granules with varying powder and liquid binder properties were created using single drop nucleation. These granules were inserted in a Breakage Only Granulator, a <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> granulator with non-granulating cohesive sand as the bulk medium. Two different impellers were used at impeller speeds of 500 and 750 rpm. An 11 ° beveled edge impeller was used to create both impact and shear in the granulator, and a flat plate impeller was used to minimize impact and maximize shear in the granulator. The fraction of granules which broke during the granulation process was used as a measure of granule breakage within the granulator. These results were compared with Stokes deformation numbers calculated using mean dynamic peak flow stresses measured in unconfined uni-axial compression tests. Results for the beveled edge impeller blade show increasing breakage with increasing Stokes deformation number. Significant breakage was observed at high Stokes deformation number. Increasing impeller speed increased the magnitude of breakage. The Stokes deformations number appears to be a reasonable predictor for granule breakage within the granulator. Results for the flat plate impeller show very little breakage at 500 rpm, and significant breakage for only one formulation at 750 rpm. This suggests that either impact is dominant over shear for breakage within the granulator, or that the two impeller designs give substantially different collision velocities in the granulator.

In this study, experiments are performed using the axisymmetric laminar jet system. The breakup of a laminar axisymmetric jet is a well-studied fluid dynamics phenomenon. Despite the extensive literature on jet breakup, the impact of surface active agents on jet breakup has received limited attention. An extensive series of experiments with water-air and oil-water jet systems with and without surfactants has been performed, varying fluid flow rate, jet diameter, jet bulk viscosity, surfactant type, and surfactant concentration. Surfactants were found to significantly affect the breakup of laminar liquid jets. Significant effects on both the length of jets and the size of resulting droplets are reported. In general, the effect of surfactants is to reduce the interfacial tension of the system in question, which results in longer jet breakup lengths and larger diameter droplets. However, the interfacial tension alone is insufficient to explain the physics of the jet breakup phenomena. Several breakup mechanisms were identified, and the regimes in which each operates vary not only due to jet geometry and velocity, but on the interfacial properties as well. The effect of surfactants on the breakup phenomena differs in each of these distinct breakup regimes. A mechanistic model for the prediction of breakup length for surfactant laden jets is presented.

40|$|Symposium on Science and Technology of Powders and Sintered Materials (STPMF 2009), Montpellier, FRANCE, MAY 25 - 27, 2009 International audienceThis study aims at better {{understanding}} the wet granulation process of a binary mixture composed of microcrystalline cellulose (water insoluble) and lactose (water soluble). It investigates {{the effect of}} formulation (proportion of the different components in the mixture) on the granule growth kinetics, the evolution of granule morphology during granulation, the wet mass consistency and dry granule strength of the end product. Additionally the influence of mixer design has been studied by up scaling the process from the 1. 9 L Mi-pro <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> used as the reference scale to a 6 L Diosna P 1 - 6 <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer.</b> The scale-up rules investigated were constant impeller tip speed and constant Froude number. Our results allowed us to draw the following conclusions: - The increase in MCC content is found to increase the optimum binder requirement for granulation, wet mass consistency and dry granule strength. - Granule growth takes place in three distinct stages: wetting, nucleation and growth. These stages can be identified {{with the help of}} the recorded torque values during the granulation process or by the evolution of granule size and granule morphology. - The characterization of the starting materials by moisture sorption isotherms brings more insight to the role of each component during the granulation process. - The increase of the granulation scale has little influence on the observed growth mechanism. However bimodality of the granule size distribution is increased, wet mass consistency and dry granule strength are decreased with increasing scale of operation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, Hoornaert et al. (Powder Technol. 96 (1998); 116 - 128) presented data from granulation experiments {{performed in a}} 50 L Lodige <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer.</b> In this study that same data was simulated with a population balance model. Based on {{an analysis of the}} experimental data, the granulation process was divided into three separate stages: nucleation, induction, and coalescence growth. These three stages were then simulated separately, with promising results. it is possible to derive a kernel that fit both the induction and the coalescence growth stage. Modeling the nucleation stage proved to be more challenging due to the complex mechanism of nucleus formation. From this work some recommendations are made for the improvement of this type of model...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{quantify}} the boundaries and validate the granule growth regime map for liquid-bound granules recently proposed by Iveson and Litster (AlChE J. 44 (1998) 1510). This regime map postulates that the type of granule growth behaviour is a function of only two dimensionless groups: the amount of granule deformation during collision (characterised by a Stokes deformation number, St(def)) and the maximum granule pore saturation, s(max). The results of experiments performed with a range of materials (glass ballotini, iron ore fines, copper chalcopyrite powder and a sodium sulphate and cellulose mixture) using both drum and <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> granulators were examined. The drum granulation results gave good agreement with the proposed regime map. The boundary between crumb and steady growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 1 and the boundary between steady and induction growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 001. The nucleation only boundary occurs at pore saturations that increase from 70 % to 80 % with decreasing St(def). However, the <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> results all had St(def) numbers which were too large. This is most likely to be because the chopper tip-speed is an over-estimate of the average impact velocity granules experience and possibly also due to the dynamic yield strength of the materials being significantly greater than the yield strengths measured at low strain rates. Hence, the map is only a useful tool for comparing the granulation behaviour of different materials in the same device. Until we {{have a better understanding of}} the flow patterns and impact velocities in granulators, it cannot be used to compare different types of equipment. Theoretical considerations also revealed that several of the regime boundaries are also functions of additional parameters not explicitly contained on the map, such as binder viscosity.

40|$|Granulation is {{the process}} by which a large number of fine {{particles}} (primary particles) are agglomerated together {{in the presence of a}} liquid to form a smaller number of larger particles (granules). The process of granulation can be carried out as dry or wet depending upon process conditions. Dry granulation is where the powdered particles, with or without the binder, are compressed together under high pressure to form granules. Wet granulation begins with the addition of a liquid binder to the powders that are to be granulated. There are well known and established techniques such as <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> <b>mixers</b> and fluidised beds which are currently used for the wet granulation of materials. Being batch processes these techniques can process material of variable quality and consistency. In the pharmaceutical industry the production of granules is still mostly based on a batch concept. Continuous process forms are considered to be feasible for only large volume productions and too inflexible for product changes which can occur daily. However, it is gaining in popularity recently since it provides several advantages over batch processes. Techniques such as roller compaction and spray drying are used for the continuous production of granules. In this context, twin-screw granulation can be seen as the latest process form for continuous wet granulation. Some studies have reported the utility of this equipment in continuous wet granulation. However, there are many other possibilities still left undiscovered. The present study was targeted to characterize the process of wet granulation in a twin screw granulator. The effect of variables like powder feed rate, liquid to solid ratio, screw speed, viscosity of granulation liquid on the granulation behavior and granular properties were studied. To determine the effect that each of these had on the properties of the granules, analysis was carried out to determine the size, shape, flowability and strength of the granules. The flow of powder in the twin screw granulator was studied using PIV. Finally, the granulation process along the length of screw was studied. The data will be useful to map the process of granulation using a twin screw granulator. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Some {{highlights}} are: (1) During this quarter's field trials, {{sand mold}} castings of parts and permanent mold tensile testing bars, K mold bars, and ingots {{were made from}} aluminum alloy-fly ash melts. (2) Another objective was met, i. e., to use class ''F'' type precipitator fly ash consisting of particle sizes less than 100 microns. It was possible to pour the composite melt into the sand mold through a filter. (3) Trials were run to determine the required amount of the wetting agent, magnesium, to ensure appropriate mixing of the aluminum alloy and fly ash. The magnesium content required to mix ''F'' fly ash was much lower compared to that required to mix hybrid ''C-F'' fly ash in similar melts. Fly ash particles of less than 100 microns were mixed in aluminum melt. Large scale field trials were undertaken at Eck Industries {{with the goal of}} standardizing procedures for producing aluminum-fly ash composite melts and to analyze the structure and properties of the resulting material. Limited testing of tensile properties has been done on pressure die cast parts, and attempts are underway to improve the distribution of fly ash in both sand cast and pressure die cast samples. Eck Industries performed radiographic, heat treatment, and tensile tests on permanent mold cast tensile test bars. After fly ash mixing experiments, the Lanxide <b>high</b> speed-high <b>shear</b> <b>mixer</b> (originally designed for mixing Al-SiC melts) was employed in an attempt to avoid fly ash agglomeration. It led to demixing (instead of deagglomerating) of some fly ash. However, the permanent mold tensile bars poured after <b>high</b> <b>shear</b> mixing displayed good distribution of fly ash in castings. A modified impeller design is being considered for <b>high</b> speed-high <b>shear</b> mixing of aluminum-fly ash melts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe morphological, thermal and non-isothermal {{crystallization}} {{behavior of}} poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its blends with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) processed in low (LSM) and <b>high</b> (HSM) <b>shear</b> <b>mixers</b> were studied by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The processing effect on the PVDF melt and crystallization kinetics was described {{and the effect of}} PMMA on the PVDF crystallization was also investigated. The addition of PMMA into PVDF increases of relative B phase content independent of the processing conditions. The validity of the modified Avrami and Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (KJMA) models for the non-isothermal crystallization of PVDF/PMMA blends are discussed. The KJMA method described accurately the non-isothermal crystallization behavior. The results showed a shift in the PVDF crystallization/fusion peak to lower temperatures. The activation energies for crystallization of PVDF and its blends evaluated through the isoconversional method using Friedman's approximation were higher for samples processed in the LSM. Differences in the activation energies were related to the ability of the molecular segments to crystallize when reaching the growing crystallization front, confirming that the mixing process has some effect on the interaction between the polymers. On the other hand, the isoconversional methods in combination with the KJMA equation provide better understanding of the kinetics of the crystallization process demonstrated by a strongly dependence of activation energy (Ea), relative crystalline fraction (XT), and global and local Avrami exponents (n and n (XT)) ...|$|R
