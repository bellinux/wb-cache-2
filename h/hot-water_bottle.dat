60|$|Sheldon obeyed her instructions, rushed <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles</b> {{along to}} her, {{and then sat}} on the veranda vainly trying to {{interest}} himself in a two- months-old file of Sydney newspapers.

60|$|In a {{few moments}} Lettie {{was up in the}} spare bedroom, {{arranging}} and adorning, and Rebecca was running with <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles,</b> and hurrying down with clean bed-clothes. Lettie hastily appropriated my best brushes—which she had given me—and took the suit of pajamas of the thinnest, finest flannel—and discovered a new tooth-brush—and made selections from my shirts and handkerchiefs and underclothing—and directed me which suit to lend him. Altogether I was astonished, and perhaps a trifle annoyed, at her extraordinary thoughtfulness and solicitude.|$|R
5|$|The Malé Friday Mosque is {{oriented}} west. Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray. Devotees enter the mosque from the Islamic Centre, climbing several marble steps {{leading to the}} mosque balcony. The prayer hall below has a burgundy-coloured carpet, patterned with images resembling <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles</b> which demarcate spaces for the believers offering prayers. The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers.|$|R

5000|$|During the genocidal {{campaign}} against the Polish Jews culminating in the Aktion Reinhard of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage. [...] Robbery of Polish Jews and looting of their property became the norm. In every town and village, Jews were forced to hand over not merely gold, currency and other valuables, but virtually anything consumable, including furniture and clothing. Even items such as birdcages, door handles and <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles</b> were looted. Any excuse, or none at all, became the pretext for extortion.|$|R

When the winter came they would have to bring in ice from the stream.|$|R

That's what I call comfort. A <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle</b> shoved under your feet--I should suppose I was a woman, and a feeble one at that. I'll tell you what I think about this Black Forest business, Bessie: I think it's part of a system of {{deception}} that runs through the whole German character.

It was so obviously a procession intended to impress, that neither Peter nor Sogrange thought it worth while to conceal their interest.|$|E

40|$|Erythema ab igne (EAI) is a red-brown netlike {{hyperpigmentation}} due to repetitive {{exposure to}} submaximal heat {{over a long}} period of time. This rash is typically seen on the anterior lower legs of people who sit in front of open fireplaces or coal stoves and on the trunk of patients with chronic disorders who seek pain relief by long-term use of <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles</b> or heating pads. EAI can not only be a diagnostic sign for underlying internal diseases including malignant tumors but can also give rise to cutaneous malignancies.

5000|$|Tarnier {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} {{involving}} the perinatal aspects of obstetrics, and in particular, the treatment and well-being of premature infants. In the 1870s he realized that keeping a constant temperature was not sufficient for a premature infant's survival. He believed that isolation, hygiene, appropriate feeding, and a warm, humid environment were also necessary. Inspired by a device used to incubate poultry, Tarnier introduced prototypes of infant incubators to the Paris Maternité in 1881. These devices were basically wooden boxes with glass lids and compartments that contained <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles.</b> He called his [...] "baby-warming device" [...] a [...] "couveuse", [...] and through it Tarnier was responsible for a 28% decrease in infant mortality {{over a three-year period}} at the Paris Maternité.|$|R
60|$|The {{rites of}} {{preparing}} for bed were elaborate and unchanging. The blankets had to be tucked in {{at the foot of}} his cot. (Also, the reason why the maid hadn't tucked in the blankets had to be discussed with Mrs. Babbitt.) The rag rug was adjusted so that his bare feet would strike it when he arose in the morning. The alarm clock was wound. The <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle</b> was filled and placed precisely two feet {{from the bottom of the}} cot.|$|E

60|$|Their ample {{discussion}} of {{every detail of}} the cigar-lighter led them to speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle,</b> and he announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding each new intricate mechanism--metal lathe, two-jet carburetor, machine gun, oxyacetylene welder--he learned one good realistic-sounding phrase, and used it over and over, with a delightful feeling of being technical and initiated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{babies were}} kept in a wicker basket {{borrowed}} from the neighbours, covered with heated blankets. They were brought {{into the kitchen and}} set by {{the open door of the}} stove to keep warm. One by one, they were taken out of the basket and massaged with olive oil. Every two hours for the first twenty-four, they were fed water sweetened with corn syrup. By the second day they were moved to a slightly larger laundry basket and kept warm with <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles.</b> They were watched constantly and often had to be roused.

25|$|The Knight Bus is {{a heavily}} enchanted purple triple-decker Regent Three class bus that {{transports}} witches and wizards.

The Knight Bus is faster than travelling by broomstick, but not as fast as near instantaneous Floo Powder and Apparating. The bus charges for the service based on distance; Harry is charged a base fare of 11 Sickles to travel from Little Whinging to The Leaky Cauldron. Amenities such as <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles,</b> toothbrushes, and hot chocolate are available for a small additional fee.|$|R
60|$|In his {{own house}} Richard Kenton lay down awhile, deadly sick, {{and his wife had}} to bring him brandy before he could control his nerves {{sufficiently}} to speak. Then he told her what he had done, and why, and Mary pulled off his shoes and put a <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle</b> to his cold feet. It was not exactly the treatment for a champion, but Mary Kenton was not thinking of that, and when Richard said he still felt a little sick at the stomach she wanted him to try a drop of camphor in addition to the brandy. She said he must not talk, but she wished him so much to talk that she was glad when he began.|$|E
6000|$|The {{doors of}} the waiting-room were thrown open, and cries of [...] "Erste Klasse! Zweite Klasse! Dritte Klasse!"

Oh, yes, Mrs. Dr. dear, she found it, in the goose at the dinner-table, mixed up with the stuffing. Do you think a woman like that would do for a minister's mother-in-law? I do not.

60|$|A strange exotic creature, this Saki, to us {{many others}} {{who were trying to}} do it too. For we were so domestic, he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan. While we were being funny, as planned, with collar-studs and <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles,</b> he was being much funnier with werwolves and tigers. Our little dialogues were between John and Mary; his, and how much better, between Bertie van Tahn and the Baroness. Even the most casual {{intruder}} into one of his sketches, as it might be our Tomkins, had to be called Belturbet or de Ropp, and for his hero, weary man-of-the-world at seventeen, nothing less thrilling than Clovis Sangrail would do. In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar-studs; if Saki's careless cruelty, that strange boyish insensitiveness of his, did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter. It may have been so; but, fortunately, our efforts to be funny in the Saki manner have not survived to prove it.|$|R

60|$|In {{the first}} place, Mrs. Evelegh ordered a Great Manitou. That, however, mattered little to 'the firm,' as I loved {{to call us}} (because it shocked dear Elsie so); for, of course, after all her {{kindness}} we couldn't accept our commission on her purchase, so that she got her machine cheap for £15 from the maker. But, in the second place--I declare I am beginning to write like a woman of business--she decided to run over to England for the summer to see her boy at Portsmouth, being certain now that the discoloration of her bangle depended more {{on the presence of}} sulphur in the india-rubber bottle than on the passing state of her astral body. 'Tis an abrupt descent from the inner self to a <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle,</b> I admit; but Mrs. Evelegh took the plunge with grace, like a sensible woman. Dr. Fortescue-Langley had been annihilated for her at one blow: she returned forthwith to common-sense and England.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Evelegh was rich--'left comfortably,' as {{the phrase}} goes, {{but with a}} clause which {{prevented}} her marrying again without losing her fortune; and I could gather from various hints that Dr. Fortescue-Langley, whoever he might be, was bleeding her to some tune, using her soul and her inner self as his financial lancet. I also noticed that what she said about the bangle was strictly true; generally bright as a new pin, on certain mornings it was completely blackened. I {{had been at the}} chalet ten days, however, before I began to suspect the real reason. Then it dawned upon me one morning in a flash of inspiration. The evening before had been cold, for at the height where we were perched, even in August, we often found the temperature chilly in the night, and I heard Mrs. Evelegh tell Cécile, her maid, to fill the <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottle.</b> It was a small point, but it somehow went home to me. Next day the bangle was black, and Mrs. Evelegh lamented that her inner self must be suffering from an attack of evil vapours.|$|E

Yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest deviation from daily routine and ritual. She would tell her friends--she ran over their names one by one--exactly what measures she had taken against the lace cover on the radiator-top and in regard to her two tortoise-shell hair brushes and the comb at right angles. How she had set everything in order--everything in order.

As he wipes his forehead, the final two spots are removed and {{transferred}} to his paw. Just then, Tom sees a small jar of red paint hidden in the corner, while Jerry puts the book down and tip-toes from him, Tom paints three spots on his head, which realization dawns on him; his mirror image changes to a donkey jackass. Tom becomes furious after realizing that he was tricked, grabs a sword and ready to get back at Jerry. He finds the mouse sitting hunched-up with head in hands, looking very depressed somehow and he only blinks at Tom apathetically when prodded with the sword's keen point. Only when Tom snatches him up does Jerry break out in genuine measles spots, which proliferate before Tom's horrified gaze. Tom quickly dashes to the bathroom and wash his hands and then doses himself frantically with everything he can find from the medicine cabinet (throat sprays, pills, mouthwash, nasal drops, etc., but little does he know that there is no cure for measles), while a sped-up version of George Frideric Handel's Death March plays over.|$|R

The majority gave similar testimonies of political vio-lence and torture during police interrogations. The {{aim of the}} present study was to describe gen-eral features and patterns of torture by the police in Bangladesh as well as medical and psychiatric sequelae in this group of alleged victims. The majority was young men, mean age twenty-nine, who had been politically active in op-positional student organisations, arrested in the street during demonstrations, and accused of il-legal possessions of arms or of murder. They were all kicked and beaten with police batons and fists. The most common torture methods were beatings on the soles with lathi, wooden canes or <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles,</b> straight or upside-down suspension, elec-tric shocks, and asphyxication by means of hot and/or polluted water poured into the nostrils. All the women and nearly a third of the men alleged that they had been raped.

50|$|Camera in hand, Latour {{immediately}} demonstrated {{he had a}} photographer’s eye. He did {{not leave}} an extensive photographic output, but it is of high quality. Latour was the correspondent of a press agency, but his work {{is not so much}} documentary as poetic. He seized in black and white shards of life and of the world, minuscule evanescent events of everyday life that his camera arrested in flight. His subjects include pedestrians crossing a street viewed from below knee level, a motorcycle hoisted aboard a ship that seems to be flying through the air, or a fisherman whose amiable smile appears to be squeezed between his Gallic moustache and the beret jammed on his head. He also captured passers-by that look like Lilliputians in front of a giant advertisement for the Galeries Lafayette, people seen from the back as they are looking from a bridge on the Seine which is not visible in the picture, or an odd and playful accumulation of pipes, wigs, <b>hot-water</b> <b>bottles</b> in a store window. Latour was artistic kin to other street poets like Robert Doisneau, Willy Ronis and Edouard Boubat. His keen and mobile eye sought new angles, from above or from below: a bird’s-eye view of a bottle of wine and a slice of bread transforms the latter into an original still life. He could focus on a detail and find delight in almost nothing. He would frame precisely and only what he was interested in, even if that meant cutting heads, leaving out the second wheel of a bicycle, or use the windshield of a car as a frame within the frame.|$|R
