Study was conducted in Surakarta Local Government employees who used computer facilities to access the internet in their duties. Data analysis involved validity testing namely Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), reliability testing with Cronbach's Alpha, and hypothesis testing was done using hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicated a positive significant relationship between role ambiguity, role conflict and cyberloafing. The influence of the role overload in cyberloafing moderated by internet experience...|$|E

Banking legislation and regulation changes have aim & to strengthen the industry and to provide consumers with more services and more choices among providers. Ownership of many banks is changing hands as holding companies acquire additional banks both within and beyond their home states.

40|$|There are {{two ways}} in the {{computor}} graphics, the one is by a X-Y plotter {{and the other is}} by a high speed line printer. Nevertheless accuracy of the graphics a line printer has two merits compare with a X-Y plotter. One of them is a graphic speed and the other is a mass of graphics. We experienced concerned with a speed of graphics that it takes 5 ～ 20 minutes to graphic by a X-Y plotter, but it takes only 1 ～ 2 secs to graphic the allmost same object by a high speed line printer. The other our experience is that it is very effective to eliminate the errors from a lot of experimental data, when we use this way of the graphic. We reported our <b>experienes</b> and the merits by a high speed line printer. We keep our new eye for the merits of the computer graphics by a high speed printer. He has speed and mass for the graphics...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that {{intrusive}} and over general autobiographical memory are correlated. Thus, paradoxically, in some patients a hyper accessibility of memory for one (series of) event(s) goes hand-in-hand with a scarcity of memories for other personal <b>experienes.</b> This clinical observation {{is reminiscent of the}} laboratory phenomenon of retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). This refers to the finding that repeatedly recalling some experimental stimuli impairs subsequent recall of related (i. e., tied to the same retrieval cue) stimuli. RIF of emotional autobiographical memories might provide an experimental model for the clinical memory phenomena in question. The present paper reports two experiments that explored the merits of applying the retrieval practice paradigm to relatively broad categories of autobiographical memories. Both studies found a significant RIF effect in that practised memories were recalled better than unrelated unpractised (baseline) memories. In addition, unpractised memories that were related to the practised memories were recalled more poorly than baseline memories. Implications of these findings for modelling the co-occurrence of intrusive and over-general memories are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{death of}} a loved one is an event that can shatter the {{carefully}} constructed edifice of one's everyday life and which can cause us to question out basic assumptions about ourselves and the world we inhabit. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the lived <b>experienes</b> of four humanistic therapists who had suffered a significant bereavement, and how this had affected their therapeutic practice. I chose a qualitative approach to the research underpinned by the epistemological and philosophical paradigms of phenomenology. The method chosen for analysing the data was Interpretative Phenomenoliogical Analysis (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009). Data was collected by using semi-structured interviews which were subsequently transcribed and analysed using an inductive, iterative approach that starts with the particular and builds up themse. Four master themes emerged from the data analysis comprising eight sub-themes. The findings suggest that bereavement is a unique experience that can be influenced by a variety of factors, and which can challenge one's sense of self and social identity. It can also result in personal growth and renewal as the bereaved relearn the world and reconstruct their identity. A major finding was the theme relating to the interface between the personal and professional and how continued professional development, including supervision, informed the participants' practice. Finally, the findings suggest that through the process of working through their own grief, the particpants' personal experience results in enhanced empathic understanding and connectedness in their therapuetuc relationships. The findings are generally consistent with other research in this area, although there are also significant differences. Further research in this area could involve a longtudinal study on the relationship between the changing impact on practice and the evolving process of grieving...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} suicide attempts {{in a group of}} drug abusers who previously had received treatment of their addiction. Another aim is to interpret and analyse the life situations that the individual associates with the suicide attempt. The dissertation is based on interviews conducted on two occasions with 92 drug abusers, 62 men and 30 women. The majority of the drug abusers were injection addicts with a complicated social situation going back many years. The theoretical tools focus on an interactive and an individual level and the analyses concern the relation between the suicide attempt and the drug abuse, social interaction, emotional experiences, and self perception. Results from the study shows that 39 percent of the drug abusers had attempted suicide during their period of active drug abuse, 60 percent were women. The suicide attempts took place at the start of their abuse career or /and after many years of abuse when they were deeply involved {{in the life of a}} drug addict. Five "keysituations" were identified and related to the suicide attempt. Theese reflected different lifesituations, which were related to the drug career. The keysituations were: suicide in the teens, mental pane which became unbearable, various coersive interventions linked to the abuse, the negative effects of the addiction such as an increasingly chaotic situation which could be described as "the rock bottom" and finally the fifth situation which reflected the processes of breaking out of addiction and the difficulty of living an "ordinary" social life. The analyses of the interviewees´narratives showed the relation between social, interactive, and individual factors and the significance of the abuse for the suicidal act. It was palpaple that the suicide attempt was explained on the basis of the specific stiuation in which it happened. This indicate that the suicide attempt is linked to specific social contexts, interactions with other people and the individual´s interpretation of this context. Whatever the context, the emotional <b>experienes</b> of the subjects were charged with feelings of shame and guilt and despair over their lifs situation...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{in culture}} {{encounter}} {{is about the}} Norwegian grass root movement for the Palestinians and the Jews. After the Second World War the whole Norwegian society was largely supporting the Jews, and the Palestinians was only referred to as Arabs and not as Palestinians. The Norwegians did not relate {{to them in the}} same way as the Jews, and in this context the Norwegian Palestinian Committee was founded in 1970. Their goal was to support the Palestinians in their fight for national liberation. Five years later the organization Med Israel for fred (MIFF) was founded, and their goal was to give correct information about the Israel-Palestine conflict. They would also refute what they meant was unilateral information from the Palestinian Committee. From the 1970 s the Norwegian society has reversed in their attitudes, and today the media, the opinion and the politics tend to be much more supportive to the Palestinians than to Israel. The two organizations represent more than 12 000 members, and are working towards political goals in line with the wishes of the Palestinians and the Jews. In this thesis I have examined what affects the volunteers in MIFF and the Palestine committee when it comes to motivation and engagement. My research shows that the volunteers in both organizations are motivated by concrete events in the conflict like the Six-day or the war in Gaza in 2014. But what motivates them the most is trips to Israel or Palestine, which has resulted in the establishment and administration of local branches. The research also shows that they strive with the same challenges when it comes to knowledge about the conflict in the society, and a polarized debate. But there are also some differences, to illustrate; MIFF is in a position where they find media to be harder to relate to, because they find them to be partisan to the Palestine. MIFF are also more often confronted in a negative way when presenting their views or opinions. This thesis shows that the volunteers relate to different realities, and have totally different <b>experienes</b> with the Palestine-conflict...|$|R
