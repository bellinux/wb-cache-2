Naoki Hisaya had worked {{as one of the}} main scenario writers for Kanon, but once the project was complete, he left the brand. Another member of the staff that made Kanon was OdiakeS, an outsourced composer who has since helped Key with two music albums, one each released for Air and Clannad, but <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> with Key since 2004. Three staff members only worked with Key on Air: Takashi Ishikawa as one of the scenario writers, Kazuki Fujii as a scenario assistant, and Din as a background artist. Air and Clannad had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as scenario writers. Kai later headed the planning of Kud Wafter, as well as contributing on the scenario of Angel Beats, Harmonia and Summer Pockets. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle Mikipon, left after Clannad. Two other outsourced graphic artists, Minimo Tayama and Torino, have often contributed on Key's games. Scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between Air and Planetarian. Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for Planetarian, and another artist, Fumio, worked as the art director for Tomoyo After.|$|E

500|$|On November 27, 2008, Blagojevich {{hinted that}} Davis {{might be his}} choice. On December 6, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that Jackson was among the minority of potential candidates {{who had not been}} granted a meeting with Blagojevich on the subject, but two days later Blagojevich granted Jackson a meeting. [...] On December 9, the day after a 90-minute meeting that Jackson described as his first meeting with Blagojevich in years, the Rod Blagojevich federal corruption scandal became public when the Governor was arrested. On December 10, Jackson was contacted by federal prosecutors for questioning with regard to the scandal involving Governor Blagojevich's search for a replacement. [...] The press speculated that Jackson was [...] "Senate Candidate #5", for whom it is alleged by Blagojevich that emissaries offered up to a million dollars in exchange for the appointment. [...] Jackson, however, denies any wrongdoing, and says that the U.S. Attorney's office assured him that he is not a target of the investigation. [...] In a press conference, his lawyer confirmed his belief that Jackson is candidate No. 5, but asserted that he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong. [...] Immediately thereafter, in his own news conference, Jackson confirmed that he is a subject and not a target of the investigation and emphatically stated his opposition to [...] "pay to play" [...] politics. [...] On December 16, a Jackson spokesperson confirmed special federal investigators have been questioning him since the summer. [...] Also WLS-TV reported December 15 that Jackson has notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Sandi Jackson, his wife, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund. Jackson spokesman Kenneth Edmonds clarified that although Jackson had been a federal informant for over a decade, never did his cooperation concern the current investigation into the Senate seat.|$|E
500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this goal, Nietzsche parodied a passage from the New Testament, which the Nietzsche-Archiv, headed by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, decided to suppress so {{that there would be}} no doubt as to the strict correctness of Nietzsche's use of the Bible. According to Nietzsche, one of the thieves, who was also being crucified, said, [...] "This was truly a divine man, a child of God!" [...] Nietzsche had Christ reply, [...] "If you feel this, you are in Paradise, you are a child of God." [...] In the Bible, only Luke related a dialogue between Christ and the thief in which the thief said, [...] "This man <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong" [...] to which, Christ replied, [...] "Today I tell you, you will be with me in Paradise." [...] (Luke 23: 39-43) Nietzsche had the thief speaking the words that the centurion later spoke in Luke 23: 47, Matthew 27: 54, and Mark 15: 39. In these passages, Christ was called the Son of God by the soldier. The Nietzsche Archives' suppression was lifted in later editions and now appears exactly as Nietzsche wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Deburau's great successes {{had come}} in the [...] "pantomime-féerie", {{featuring}} frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. [...] Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. [...] It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, {{and it was in}} the [...] "realistic" [...] pantomime that he excelled. [...] At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of Pierrot Dandin (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in Pierrot Dandin. [...] We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> but this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. [...] It must indeed be difficult to make people cry when one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. [...] Well! [...] Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. [...] In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. [...] The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's Bureaucrat Pierrot (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a very lazy, very inaccurate clerk. [...] At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. [...] Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little carafe of wine. 1023, MS 3408, sc. 1 (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr.
