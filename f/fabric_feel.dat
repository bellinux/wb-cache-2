There are several different styles of athletic apparel available at retailers and each individual has a preference as to what is comfortable for him or her. Comfort of clothing has traditionally been related to the <b>fabric</b> <b>feel</b> and thermal comfort of the individual. However, comfort can be defined with numerous other variables; such as fit, the environment, and the style of the garment. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to understand how runners perceive the fit, skin sensation and thermal comfort of three style treatments of running pants. In each treatment, the textile, environment, and fit of the pant was controlled. The three pant treatments were Style A: fitted pant with 0...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{development}} of an instrument to measure fabric handle characteristic objectively. A nozzle extraction method for objective measurement of fabric handle characteristics has been developed. The instrument measures the force exerted by the fabric being drawn out of the nozzle axially {{as well as on}} the periphery of the nozzle i. e. radials. These two forces in perpendicular directions have been used to determine the handle characteristics of fabric. Accuracy and reproducibility of the newly developed testing instrument is verified. It has been observed that the fabric extraction force and load time graph obtained from the instrument gives valuable information to draw some meaningful conclusion regarding the nature of fabric and the handle characteristics of the fabric. The preliminary test results indicate that <b>fabric</b> <b>feel</b> can be comprehensively judged from a single test from the instrument objectively. Cost and time involved in testing is also less compared to other existing instruments...|$|E
40|$|Fabric hand forms a {{significant}} component of clothing comfort. It {{is defined by}} the quality, aesthetics and appeal of a material. A good <b>fabric</b> <b>feel</b> creates asatisfying interaction between the garment wearer and their external environment. One form of fabric hand assessment is the subjective rating of fabrics when people use their five sensory modalities. This method forms an important aspect of fabric quality assessment and relies mostly on the spontaneous preference of a person whilst he examines the fabric. Another form of assessment is the use of FOM [Fabric Objective Measurement] technology with instruments like the KES-FB [Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabrics] to objectively measure textile parameters. However, the relationship between subjective rating and objective measurement has not been studied widely with regard to the direct role of the human sensory system and its contribution towards fabric hand. An attempt has been made to use the bio-medical engineering imaging technique, the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technique to study human perception towards fabric textures. The study was conducted to identify and create a sensory paradigm suitable for fMRI scanning of fabrics. The experiment attempted to verify the use of passive touch [no finger movement] for four different fabric hands. These fabric hands were classified as smooth-unpleasant, smooth-pleasant, rough-unpleasant and rough-pleasant. The perceptual response of eight, healthy, right-handed male volunteers was studied for the specified textures. The prime hypothesis was that the somatosensory area in the brain responds to different textures. The project aimed to create a relationship linking subjective descriptions, sensory perception and objective measurements of textile materials. The parietal lobe was activated for all textures especially in Sl areas BA 1, BA 2 and BA 3. Maximum activation was seen while rubbing the fabric on the fingers, followed by placement of fabric on fingers. These two conditions were compared to the baseline condition when there was no placement of fabric on fingers. The perception of pleasant fabrics was felt in the temporai lobe and parietal lobe. The perception of unpleasant fabrics was felt more in the frontal lobe and parietal lobe. The KES-FB was used to measure the mechanical parameters like roughness, bending, shear, compression and friction to support the fabric hand using fMRI and subjective rating of the fabrics.

Providing suitable cooling vests for these workers might help alleviate heat stress during summer time. However, whether workers are willing to wear cooling vests is still uncertain because of various personal preferences. To understand the determinants of worker preferences on two kinds of cooling vests, field studies were conducted in construction, horticulture and cleaning, and airport apron services industries, respectively. Workers were asked to rate 18 items of subjective attributes from a self-administrated questionnaire. Based on 17 items of subjective attributes, workers revealed four underlying factors; namely, thermal comfort, usability, tactile comfort, and <b>fabric</b> hand (<b>feel),</b> as the underlying factors affecting their preference. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted between the four underlying factors derived from factor analysis and one dependent variable 'dislike-like' to find out the reasons why horticultural and cleaning workers preferred one type of cooling vest over the others. Results indicated that while male and female workers were influenced differently by different underlying factors, usability was the common and determining factor having the strongest correlation with their preference regardless of gender difference. Thermal comfort, tactile comfort, and <b>fabric</b> hand (<b>feel)</b> were also important factors affecting their preferences. However, the choices of male workers were influenced more by thermal comfort, whereas female workers paid more attention to tactile comfort and <b>fabric</b> hand (<b>feel).</b> Therefore, gender differences should be considered in designing and constructing suitable cooling vests.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{are increasingly}} incorporated in textiles {{in order to}} serve as a thermal buffer when humans change from a hot to a cold environment and the reverse. Due to the absence of wetness sensors in the skin, cooling of the skin may be perceived as a sensation of wetness instead of cold. In order to investigate if this phenomenon occurs when manipulating textiles, nine subjects were asked to touch or manipulate PCM-treated and untreated fabrics. In 75 % of the cases, the subjects indicated that the treated material felt wetter than the untreated material independent of the way the textiles were manipulated. We conclude that incorporating PCMs in textiles may lead to a feeling of wetness which might be uncomfortable. Therefore, we recommend investigating a change in cooling properties to minimise this feeling. Practitioner Summary: This article describes a psychophysical experiment into the sensation of wetness of textiles treated with phase change materials.

40|$|Touch feels of textile {{materials}} are major factors related to the clothing comfort. We could perceive touch feels through contacts between skin and fabrics. Latest researches concluded there were four types of touch information including thermal, proprioceptive, cutaneous, and irritant and pains. There is a clear gap between current measurement methods on <b>fabric</b> touch <b>feels</b> and latest theoretical research outputs. This report introduced a new characterization method of textile touch feels. It simultaneously measured four categories of physical properties of textiles. Fabric Touch Tester (FTT), the reported instrument, included four modules as thermal, compression, bending and surface. Measuring time of one complete test on this instrument only took about 5 minutes. Output of FTT contained comprehensive descriptions on the physical properties of samples in both directions (warp/wale and weft/course). Experiment results showed that FTT could measure and distinguish these fabrics with good repeatability and reproducibility. Correlation study between FTT results and subjective evaluation scores showed there were significant correlations between them. Initial findings were concluded {{on the effect of}} thermal properties on other tactile perceptions as well as the interactions between different physical parameters.

There are several methods available to apply patterns and improve color control and retention on a fabric. Among the various methods for modification of surfaces of synthetic or natural fibers, laser treatment facilitating the fabric dyeing and finishing has found increasingly broad applications {{in the past few}} years. This study examined the effects of laser treatment on fabric surface in the context of changes in organoleptic fabric properties, including shape and dimensions retention, deformability, shape conformation or drapeability and other properties commonly considered as ‘hand feel’.

30|$|If the FR coating {{is applied}} to the inside face of the cover fabric as a backcoating, there may be little impact to the fabric aesthetics. However, when applied to the outside face or to both sides of the cover fabric, the <b>fabric</b> color, <b>feel,</b> and {{stiffness}} may be significantly altered. Although the aesthetics of laminated/coated fabrics may not be as desirable, these fabrics are often used to comply with the more stringent high occupant dwelling flammability regulations (e.g., Cal TB 133, Cal TB 129). In the UK, backcoated FR cover fabrics are considered to take about 80 % of the soft furnishing market ([Horrocks et al. 2007]). While FR coated cover fabrics self-extinguish and exhibit limited flame spread, they do not perform well when exposed to large ignition sources even for a short duration as they have a tendency to form brittle chars that crack open and expose the more flammable core materials. Research has shown that FR backcoating improves resistance to small flames like match and BS: Crib 5 (17 [*]±[*] 1 [*]g of wood), but when tested with large ignition sources as in Cal TB 133 or CFR 1633, the increased heat release of the backcoating results in accelerated thermal decomposition of the underlying PUF ([Gallagher 1993]). As discussed previously, it is these types of unexpected interactions between the components resulting in a synergistic or antagonistic impact on pyrolysis that makes it difficult to predict soft furnishing flammability based on the flammability characteristics of the individual components.|$|R

Through the CNN, each input, regardless of the modality, generates an embedding vector that records the fabric's physical property. By comparing the embeddings, our system is able to look at a fabric image and predict how it will feel, and vice versa. We also show that a system jointly trained on vision and touch data can outperform a similar system trained only on visual data when tested purely with visual inputs...|$|R
30|$|In the {{production}} of the paper yarn, a Hanji paper yarn is produced in almost the same process system as Japanese paper yarn, so the properties of the two paper yarns are quiet similar (Kim et al. 2006; Kim and Park 2008; Itoi 2001; Ishikawa and Shinohara 2001). In Korea, the Hanji paper yarn is made of Hanji paper sheets, so it has a high bulkiness. The thickness of paper yarn is greater than that of the same count of cotton yarn. As a result, the Hanji paper yarn is evaluated as a lightweight yarn because Hanji paper yarn’s diameter is larger meaning that the apparent specific gravity is lower (Kim et al. 2007; Park 2012). Therefore, it is possible to produce a lightweight denim <b>fabric</b> that actually <b>feels</b> lighter when worn by using the Hanji paper yarn as the weft. This is because the Hanji paper yarn is a paper yarn and is lightweight by its characteristic of yarn structure and is fast in absorption rate and drying speed rates. Therefore, Hanji denim fabric is a lightweight fabric material with a low specific gravity compared to existing denim fabric resulting in having excellent form stability and comfort.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges that need to be solved before the “Internet of Things ” becomes a reality is the lack of a scalable model to develop and deploy applications atop such a heterogeneous collection of ubiquitous devices. In practice, families of hardware devices or of software platforms have intrinsic characteristics that make it very cumbersome to write applications where arbitrary devices and platforms interact. In this paper we explore constructing the software fabric for the “Internet of Things ” {{as an extension of the}} ideas already in use for modular software development. In particular, we suggest to generalize the OSGi model to turn the “Internet of Things ” into a collection of loosely coupled software modules interacting through service interfaces. Since OSGi is Java-based, in the paper we describe how to use OSGi concepts in other contexts and how to turn non-Java capable devices and platforms into OSGi-like services. In doing this, the resulting software <b>fabric</b> looks and <b>feels</b> like well known development environments and hides the problems related to distribution and heterogeneity behind the better understood concept of modular software design. ...|$|R

It is also known that differences in wool fiber curvature (crimp) affect softness of handle of greasy wool and of wool textiles. In a replicated experiment, we investigated if wearers could detect the effect of using 17 µm superfine wool of low (74 °/mm) or high (114 °/mm) fiber curvature, and when the wools were blended with 17 µm cashmere (fiber curvature 49 °/mm) in differing proportions, on four comfort sensations. Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol using forearm sleeves made of the test fabric and a control fabric. Data (37 sensorial assessments of high curvature wool fabrics; 38 sensorial assessments of low curvature wool fabrics) were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis (restricted maximum likelihood), which included fixed effects for wool type and blend ratio and a random effect for participant. The use of a control sleeve fabric reduced variance due to participant effects by providing an anchor for each sensation over time.
