5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

25|$|It {{marked a}} turn {{to more of}} a focus on work in the trade unions, and {{a key part of}} this process was the {{pamphlet}} published in 1966: Incomes policy, legislation and shop stewards, which opposed the Labour Party's incomes policy and discussed <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be fought.|$|E
25|$|Riders became {{adept at}} {{circumventing}} controls. Their advisers learned to calculate {{how long it}} would take a drug to move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. And sometimes riders simply cheated. In 1978 the world discovered <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be done.|$|E
25|$|Neutrophil apoptosis, or {{programmed}} cell death, {{is vital}} in controlling {{the duration of}} the early inflammatory response, thus restricting damage to tissues by the neutrophils. ANCA may be developed either via ineffective apoptosis or ineffective removal of apoptotic cell fragments, leading to the exposure of the immune system to molecules normally sequestered inside the cells. This theory solves the paradox of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be possible for antibodies to be raised against the intracellular antigenic targets of ANCA.|$|E

50|$|When the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) met in February 1934, {{manufacturers}} of 'upright' bicycles lobbied to have Faure's one-hour record declared invalid. On 1 April 1934, the UCI published a new {{definition of a}} racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground, <b>how</b> far <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{be in front of}} the seat and <b>how</b> close <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be to the front wheel. The new definition effectively banned recumbents from UCI events for a combination of tradition, safety, and economic reasons.|$|R
25|$|Vladimir Igorevich Arnold {{was born}} on 12 June 1937 in Odessa, Soviet Union. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, née Isakovich), an art historian. When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an {{engineer}} told him about calculus and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, {{and he started to}} study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> possibly have ended up in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it differs}} from spyware, adware often {{uses the same}} methods and technologies. Merchants {{initially}} were uninformed about adware, what impact it had, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> damage their brands. Affiliate marketers {{became aware of the}} issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that adware often overwrites tracking cookies, thus resulting in a decline of commissions. Affiliates not employing adware felt that it was stealing commission from them. Adware often has no valuable purpose and rarely provides any useful content to the user, who is typically unaware that such software is installed on his/her computer.|$|E

25|$|By 2000, Steve Jobs {{expressed}} interest in developing a portable music player. But Rubinstein demurred, saying the necessary components were not yet available. While on a routine supplier visit to Toshiba Corp. in February, 2001, however, Rubinstein first saw the tiny, 1.8-inch hard disk drive that became {{a critical component of}} the iPod. While Toshiba engineers had developed the drive, they were not sure <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used. At a Tokyo hotel later that evening, Rubinstein met with Jobs, who was in Japan on separate business. “I {{know how to do it}} now. All I need is a $10 million check,” he told Jobs.|$|E
25|$|John and Benjamin Green were {{a father}} and son {{architectural}} practice active in Newcastle. In 1841 Benjamin Green had proposed a high level bridge for road traffic, substantially on the alignment of the actual High Level Bridge; and sensing the commercial climate he explained <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be adapted for railway use. He failed to get any financial support, but in 1843 George Hudson was looking for ways to extend his railway network northwards, and the Greens' scheme fitted with his takeover of the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway; the line got its authorising Act on 22 May 1844, and the Act included the road bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Grorud Line {{was built}} {{as part of}} the {{original}} metro network and opened on 16 November 1966. The Ring Line was built in two stages between 2000 and 2006. Oslo Sporveier announced in 2005 that it planned to double the number of services on the Grorud Line, to eight per hour. However, the bottleneck of the system is the Common Tunnel through the city center and services on all branches of the metro are limited by the capacity of that line. With the Ring Line under way, planners started to look at <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used to increase traffic flow and capacity of the metro. This would allow traffic to be diverted around the Ring Line instead of through the Common Tunnel, increasing capacity on the system as a whole.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, von Ardenne {{had come}} into his {{inheritance}} with full control as to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be spent, and he established his private research laboratory the Forschungslaboratoriums für Elektronenphysik, in Berlin-Lichterfelde, to conduct his own research {{on radio and television}} technology and electron microscopy. He financed the laboratory with income he received from his inventions and from contracts with other concerns. For example, his research on nuclear physics and high-frequency technology was financed by the Reichspostministerium (RPM, Reich Postal Ministry), headed by Wilhelm Ohnesorge. Von Ardenne attracted top-notch personnel to work in his facility, such as the nuclear physicist Fritz Houtermans, in 1940. Von Ardenne had also conducted research on isotope separation. Taking Ewald's suggestion he began building a prototype for the RPM. The work was hampered by war shortages and ultimately ended by the war.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1965, Goldenson {{announced}} a merger proposal with ITT to ABC management; {{the two companies}} agreed to the deal on April 27, 1966. The FCC approved the merger on December 21, 1966; however, the previous day (December 20), Donald F. Turner, head antitrust regulator for the United States Department of Justice, expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market, and concerns over the journalistic integrity of ABC and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{be influenced by the}} overseas ownership of ITT. ITT management promised that the company would allow ABC to retain autonomy in the publishing business. The merger was suspended, and a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice in July 1967, with ITT going to trial in October 1967; the merger was officially canceled after the trial's conclusion on January 1, 1968.|$|E
25|$|After the Federal {{criminal}} investigation ended in 1996, Zimmermann {{and his team}} started a company to produce new versions of PGP encryption. They merged with Viacrypt (to whom Zimmermann had sold commercial rights and who had licensed RSA directly from RSADSI), which then {{changed its name to}} PGP Incorporated. The newly combined Viacrypt/PGP team started work on new versions of PGP encryption based on the PGP 3 system. Unlike PGP 2, which was an exclusively command line program, PGP 3 was designed from the start as a software library allowing users to work from a command line or inside a GUI environment. The original agreement between Viacrypt and the Zimmermann team had been that Viacrypt would have even-numbered versions and Zimmermann odd-numbered versions. Viacrypt, thus, created a new version (based on PGP 2) that they called PGP 4. To remove confusion about <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be that PGP 3 was the successor to PGP 4, PGP 3 was renamed and released as PGP 5 in May 1997.|$|E

25|$|The next part in Guth's path {{came when}} he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been {{developed}} since 1974, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt proclaims The Winter's Tale as [...] "one of the best-acting of our author's plays", and recalls {{with delight}} {{some of his}} {{favourite}} actors who played the parts, including Sarah Siddons and John Kemble. He notes the incisive psychology of the unfolding of King Leontes's madness, the appealing roguery of Autolycus, and the charm of Perdita's and Florizel's speeches, after wondering <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be that Pope doubted {{the authenticity of the}} play as Shakespeare's.|$|E
500|$|As a {{group leader}} at the Metallurgical Laboratory, Creutz {{conducted}} studies of uranium and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be extruded into rods. His group looked into the process of corrosion in metals in contact with fast-flowing liquids, the [...] processes for fabricating aluminium and jacketing uranium with it. It also investigated the forging of beryllium, and the preparation of thorium. Frederick Seitz and Alvin Weinberg later reckoned that the activities of Creutz and his group may have reduced the time taken to produce plutonium by up to two years.|$|E
