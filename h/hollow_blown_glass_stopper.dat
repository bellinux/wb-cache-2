50|$|Vino-Seal is a plastic/glass closure {{released}} by Alcoa. Since its introduction into the European market in 2003, over 300 wineries have utilized Vino-Seal. Using a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> with an inert o-ring, the Vino-Seal creates a hermetic seal that prevents oxidation and TCA contamination. A disadvantage with the Vino-Seal is {{the relatively high}} cost of each plug (70 cents each) and cost of manual bottling {{due to the lack}} of compatible bottling equipment outside of Europe. Vinolok is a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> developed and produced by a Czech crystal glass producer Preciosa.|$|R

25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|R

5000|$|According to art {{historian}} Martha Drexler Lynn, [...] "Labino had a life-long love of tools, inventing and problem-solving which he {{coupled with a}} passion for artistic endeavors..." [...] His interest in <b>blowing</b> <b>glass</b> began in the 1930s, when he ran the Owens-Illinois milk bottling plant. There he had a laboratory in which he created glass formulas. In 1940, his predecessor at the plant, Ben Alderson, showed Labino how to <b>blow</b> <b>glass.</b> Labino later <b>blew</b> <b>glass</b> as a hobby; at Johns-Manville he built a home glass furnace at which to pursue the craft. An early project was a glass paperweight that he created in 1958 for a friend's retirement. By 1960 he had melted a batch of glass and created a primitive blowpipe.|$|R
