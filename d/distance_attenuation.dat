40|$|Ground-motion {{prediction}} equations (GMPEs) {{have recently}} been developed in the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project for application to shallow crustal earthquakes in tectonically active regions. We investigate the compatibility of those models with respect to magnitude scaling, distance scaling, and site scaling implied by Italian strong motion data. This is of interest because (1) the Italian data are principally from earthquakes in extensional regions that are poorly represented in the NGA dataset, and (2) past practice in Italy has been to use local GMPEs based on limited datasets that cannot resolve many significant source, path, and site effects. We find that the magnitude scaling implied by the Italian data is compatible with four NGA relations. However, the Italian data attenuate faster than implied by the four NGA GMPEs at short periods; the differences are statistically significant. Comparison with the fifth one was not possible because it was developed for rock conditions only. Three regression coefficients are reevaluated for the four NGA GMPEs to reflect the faster attenuation: a constant term, a term controlling the slope of <b>distance</b> <b>attenuation,</b> and a source fictitious depth term. The scaling of ground motion with respect to site shear wave velocity is consistent between the NGA models and Italian data. Moreover, the data are found to contain a nonlinear site effect that is generally compatible with NGA site terms. The intraevent scatter of Italian data is {{higher than in the}} NGA models, although interevent scatter is comparable to NGA recommendations when the faster <b>distance</b> <b>attenuation</b> is considered.

Values of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>distance</b> and the mean free path derived from coda studies for the earth and moon are compared, and it is found that for the frequency range 0. 5 - 10 Hz, diffusion scattering is important in lunar codas, while at frequencies from 1 to 25 Hz single scattering is important in terrestrial codas.

We show that incorporating the impact of <b>distance</b> <b>attenuation</b> and lognormal fading on each constituent interferer in the aggregate, leads to a composite interference that cannot be satisfactorily modeled by a lognormal. Using the interference statistics we determine a number of key parameters needed for the deployment of CRs. Examples of these are the exclusion zone radius, needed to protect the primary receiver under different types of fading environments and acceptable interference levels, and the numbers of CRs that can be deployed. We further show that if the CRs have apriori knowledge of the radio environment map (REM), then a much larger number of CRs can be deployed especially in a high density environment. Given REM information, we also look at the CR numbers achieved by two different types of techniques to process the scheduling information. I...|$|E

Growing nonmetro-tometro commuting is evidence of increasing urban spillovers that blur the distinction between rural and urban and are indicative of a de facto regionalization process.

The advantages, from a theoretical point of view, are: <b>distance</b> and <b>attenuation</b> are measured at the same time; each sensor measurement is not affected by the presence of similar sensors in the same field, being two independent white noises not correlated; once n sensors are used simultaneously, making use of cross correlation functions between all the emitted and all the reflexed received signals, it is possible to measure n 2 distances from each sensor to any other one. Such theoretical results have been tested on a prototypal realization, here described, and the results are illustrated. They show the real applicability of such idea.
