25|$|We were skeptical, but {{everyone}} we {{have spoken to}} since– doctors, teachers, journalists, shopkeepers– has talked of a city transformed. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ubiquitous checkpoints where the warlords’ militias killed, extorted and stole. Gone are their technicals, Jeeps with heavy machine guns mounted on the back. The infamous Bakaro arms markets has been closed.

Blood Tsunami entered Midrange Studios in January 2012 and together with engineer Anders Henningsen they recorded a new 6 track demo.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|E
25|$|Sōya {{was fully}} {{decommissioned}} in 1978. Her last mission was a farewell tour to communities she had served, including {{the port of}} Hakodate, and photographs exist from this period of well-wishers swarming the ship before her departure. In 1979 Sōya was moored alongside at the Museum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, and remains {{open to the public}} as a museum ship, open daily and generally closed only when typhoons threaten Tokyo. She remains in largely original condition. Her propellers have been removed and placed on deck but her interior is largely intact from Antarctic exploration days. However, as a result of modifications made in the 1950s her superstructure has changed considerably from her appearance during World War II. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> tall funnel and aft crane assembly, while the addition of a helicopter landing deck and higher forward gunwales give her a beefier appearance than the cargo ship she started out as.|$|E
500|$|... 1969 brought another {{change to}} Jamaican popular music {{in which the}} beat slowed down even further. [...] The new beat was a slow, steady, ticking rhythm that was first heard on the Maytals song [...] "Do the Reggay." [...] Marley {{approached}} producer Leslie Kong, who was {{regarded as one of}} the major developers of the reggae sound. For the recordings, Kong combined the Wailers with his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars, which consisted of the bassists Lloyd Parks and Jackie Jackson, the drummer Paul Douglas, the keyboard players Gladstone Anderson and Winston Wright, and the guitarists Rad Bryan, Lynn Taitt, and Hux Brown. [...] As David Moskowitz writes, [...] "The tracks recorded in this session illustrated the Wailers’ earliest efforts in the new reggae style. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ska trumpets and saxophones of the earlier songs, with instrumental breaks now being played by the electric guitar." [...] The songs recorded would be released as the album The Best of The Wailers, including tracks [...] "Soul Shakedown Party," [...] "Stop That Train," [...] "Caution," [...] "Go Tell It on the Mountain," [...] "Soon Come," [...] "Can’t You See," [...] "Soul Captives," [...] "Cheer Up," [...] "Back Out," [...] and [...] "Do It Twice".|$|E

500|$|The Late Woodland Period {{was once}} {{considered}} to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity. Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, {{but this does not}} appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. [...] Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize. Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, goosefoot, little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade. [...] The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa. At Rainbow, a large house was excavated, showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families. Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group.|$|E

The character of Cora Sanders was obviously, but loosely, {{influenced by the}} real-life Angela Y. Davis. She appeared in one episode of The Golden Girls sixth season. She played Queen Haley in , a 1979 miniseries.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{condensed}} {{version of}} this painting with four figures, long {{thought to be the}} second version of The Card Players, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also <b>gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame {{in the center of the}} wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players. The painting is brighter, with less focus on blue tones, than the larger version.|$|E

60|$|Written {{close to}} the middle of the last century, such has been the {{revolution}} worked in man's method of trafficking with the sea, that the life and conditions described in Dana's book have passed utterly away. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> crack clippers, the driving captains, the hard-bitten but efficient foremast hands. Remain only crawling cargo tanks, dirty tramps, greyhound liners, and a sombre, sordid type of sailing ship. The only records broken to-day by sailing vessels are those for slowness. They are no longer built for speed, nor are they manned before the mast by as sturdy a sailor stock, nor aft the mast are they officered by sail- carrying captains and driving mates.|$|E
60|$|How {{different}} {{is the scene}} that I have now to tell from that which has just been told! <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> quiet college rooms, gone the wind-swayed English elms, the cawing rooks, and the familiar volumes on the shelves, and in their place there rises {{a vision of the}} great calm ocean gleaming in shaded silver lights beneath the beams of the full African moon. A gentle breeze fills the huge sail of our dhow, and draws us through the water that ripples musically against her sides. Most of the men are sleeping forward, for it is near midnight, but a stout swarthy Arab, Mahomed by name, stands at the tiller, lazily steering by the stars. Three miles or more to our starboard is a low dim line. It is the Eastern shore of Central Africa. We are running to the southward, before the North East Monsoon, between the mainland and the reef that for hundreds of miles fringes this perilous coast. The night is quiet, so quiet that a whisper can be heard fore and aft the dhow; so quiet that a faint booming sound rolls across the water to us from the distant land.|$|E
6000|$|Once a {{fortress}} and a mansion, but now, unfortunately, {{little more than}} a noble ruin, Hoghton Tower stands {{on one of the most}} commanding sites in Lancashire. From the fine old entrance-gate a beautiful expanse of highly-cultivated land slopes down and stretches away to the distant sea, glimmering like a strip of molten silver; and on either hand there are beautiful woods, in the old times 'so full of tymber that a man passing through could scarce have seen the sun shine in the middle of the day.' At the foot of these wooded heights a little river ripples through a wild ravine, and meanders through the rich meadows to the proud Ribble. From the building itself, however, the glory has departed. Over the noble gateway, with its embattled towers, and in one of the fast-decaying wainscots, the old family arms, with the motto, Mal Gre le Tort, still remain; but these things, and a few mouldering portraits, are all that are left there to tell of the stately women who, from the time of Elizabeth down to comparatively modern days, pensively watched the setting sun gild the waters of the far-off Irish Sea, and dreamed of lovers away in the wars--trifling things to be the only unwritten records of the noble men who buckled on their weapons, and climbed into the turrets to gaze over the road along which would come the expected besieging parties. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> gallants and their ladies, the roystering Cavalier and the patient but none the less brave Puritan, for, as Isaac Ambrose has recorded, during the troublous times of the Restoration, the place, with its grand banqueting chamber, its fine old staircases, and quaint little windows, was 'a colledge for religion.' The old Tower resounds no more with the gay song of the one or the solemn hymn of the other, ...|$|E

6000|$|Or, again, where {{now are the}} Jacobins? Childless, most decrepit, as we saw, sat {{the mighty}} Mother; gnashing not teeth, but empty gums, against a traitorous Thermidorian Convention and the current of things. Twice were Billaud, Collot and Company accused in Convention, by a Lecointre, by a Legendre; and the second time, it was not voted calumnious. Billaud from the Jacobin tribune says, [...] "The lion is not dead, he is only sleeping." [...] They ask him in Convention, What he means by the {{awakening}} of the lion? And bickerings, of an extensive sort, arose in the Palais-Egalite between Tappe-durs and the Gilt Youthhood; cries of [...] "Down with the Jacobins, the Jacoquins," [...] coquin meaning scoundrel! The Tribune in mid-air gave battle-sound; answered only by silence and uncertain gasps. Talk was, in Government Committees, of 'suspending' the Jacobin Sessions. Hark, there!--it is in Allhallow-time, or on the Hallow-eve itself, month ci-devant November, year once named of Grace 1794, sad eve for Jacobinism,--volley of stones dashing through our windows, with jingle and execration! The female Jacobins, famed Tricoteuses with knitting-needles, take flight; are met at the doors by a Gilt Youthhood and 'mob of four thousand persons;' are hooted, flouted, hustled; fustigated, in a scandalous manner, cotillons retrousses;--and vanish in mere hysterics. Sally out ye male Jacobins! The male Jacobins sally out; but only to battle, disaster and confusion. So that armed Authority has to intervene: and again on the morrow to intervene; and suspend the Jacobin Sessions forever and a day. (Moniteur, Seances du 10-12 Novembre 1794: Deux Amis, xiii. 43-49.) <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Jacobins; into invisibility; in a storm of laughter and howls. Their place is made a Normal School, {{the first of the}} kind seen; it then vanishes into a 'Market of Thermidor Ninth;' into a Market of Saint-Honore, where is now peaceable chaffering for poultry and greens. The solemn temples, the great globe itself; the baseless fabric! Are not we such stuff, we and this world of ours, as Dreams are made of? ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already <b>gone,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
6000|$|Willum Lang's {{puckered}} face means business. He {{has been}} sent for by a millworker from Langholm, who, having an hour to spare, thinks he may as well drop in at the priest's and get spliced; or by an innocent visitor wandering through the village {{in search of the}} mythical smithy; or by a lawyer who shakes his finger threateningly at Willum (and might as well have stayed at home with his mother). From the most distant shores letters reach him regarding Gretna marriages, and if Willum dislikes monotony he must be getting rather sick of the stereotyped beginning [...] "I think your charges very extortionate." [...] The stereotyped ending [...] "but the sum you asked for is enclosed," [...] is another matter. It is generally about midnight that the rustics of the county rattle Willum's door off its snib and, bending over his bed, tell him to arise and marry them. His hand is crossed with silver coin, for <b>gone</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> bridegrooms whose gold dribbled in a glittering cascade from fat purses to a horny palm; and then, with a sleepy neighbor, a cold hearth, and a rattling cynic of a window for witnesses, he does the deed. Elsewhere I have used these words to describe the scene:--"The room in which the Gretna Green marriages have been celebrated for many years is a large rude kitchen, but dimly lighted by a small 'bole' window of lumpy glass that faces an ill-fitting back door. The draught generated between the two cuts the spot where the couples stand, and must prove a godsend to flushed and flurried bridegrooms. A bed--wooden and solid, ornamented with divers shaped and divers colored clothes dependent from its woodwork like linen hung on a line to dry--fills a lordly space. The monster fireplace retreats bashfully before it into the opposite wall, and a grimy cracked ceiling looks on a bumpy stone floor, from which a cleanly man could eat his porridge. One shabby wall is happily hid by the drawers in which Lang keeps his books; and against the head of the bed an apoplectic Mrs. Langtry in a blue dress and yellow stockings, reminding the public that Simon Lang's teas are the best, shudders at her reflection in the looking-glass that dangles opposite her from a string." [...] The signboard over a snuffy tavern that attempted to enter into rivalry with the Queen's Head depicts the priest on his knees going through the church marriage services, but the Langs have always kept their method of performing the ceremony a secret between themselves and the interested persons, and the artist in this case was doubtless drawing on his imagination. The picture is discredited by the scene of the wedding being made in a smithy, when it is notorious that the [...] "blacksmith" [...] has cut the tobacco plug, and caught fish in the Solway, and worked at the loom, the last, and the toll-bar, but never wielded Vulcan's hammer. The popular term is thus a mystery, though a witness once explained, in a trial, to Brougham, that Gretna marriages were a welding of heat. Now the welding of heat is part of a blacksmith's functions.|$|E
