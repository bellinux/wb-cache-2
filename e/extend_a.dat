40|$|The Simple Argument 1. It Is good to save someone’s life, if {{and only}} if it is a life worth living. 2. When we save someone’s life we are merely {{extending}} their life. 3. If saving a life is good, and saving a life is identical in all relevant characteristics to <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life, then <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life must be good. 4. Surely, if <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life by a limited period is good, then <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life for an indefinite period would create a vast amount of good. 5. Therefore, <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life worth living indefinitely is good. The Life Shape Hypothesis claims that the value of a life is at least partially determined by its shape of good events. If someone were to have her life extended indefinitely, then, in most cases, there would not be a discernible shape. Does indefinite life extensions eliminate the value that could have been captured by having a certain shape...|$|R

5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E
5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E

Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was {{appointed}} as the Metropolitan Railway's Chairman. A director of many railway companies, {{he had a}} vision of unifying a string of railway companies to create a single route running from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations {{to take control of the}} Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and a section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway running north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury to join the existing lines and create a direct route from London to the north of England. He also proposed to <b>extend</b> <b>a</b> short rail branch which ran from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to the small town of Brill, known as the Brill Tramway, southwest to Oxford, and thus create a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor, and although still an extremely roundabout route, had the scheme been completed it would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham, chairman of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and owner of the Brill Tramway, was enthusiastic, and authorisation for the scheme was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected.|$|E
