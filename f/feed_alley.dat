50|$|The {{interior}} of the barn has the exposed balloon framing and the circular laminated beam overhead at the barn's perimeter. The <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> runs {{around the perimeter of}} the lower level, approximately 4 ft wide. There is a gate that separates the central area from the main entrance. Moving around the lower level in a clockwise manner, the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> extends all the way around to the northwest corner where it breaks for the sliding door to the outside. On the north end of the barn, there are three large posts that open to the connector to the rectangular barn and form two openings with gates.

50|$|The lower {{interior}} of the barn has a finished concrete floor. Originally farm animals were housed on this level. The space is organized around the central bin/storage/pen area and well lit by the perimeter windows. Laminated beams located above the centralized <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> are in turn braced by support posts that define {{the outer edge of}} the feeding area. Posts run along either side of the central drive. The floor joists of the upper level radiate inwardly from the exterior -walls to the central drive and then run north and south over the central drive. At the center on the south side between the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> and central drive are pens with sliding gates. On the north side a set of permanent stairs lead to the upper haymow. The main upper level is relatively dark except for the cupola's windows. A 5 by 5 ft square grain bin located adjacent to the stairs from the lower level stops short of the roof. The rest of the main level space is open and the balloon framing of the walls and the roof. The roof system is unsupported except for the two laminated beams found at the intersection of the three roof pitches.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the barn is a composition of spaces arranged to facilitated the dairy operation. There is a central drive that runs from the main doors on the northeast and southwest. On {{either side of the}} main drive are feed alleys that are created by the central posts and a concrete feed trough, which forms a circle some 40 ft in diameter. On the east side, a concrete trough is followed by a ring of support posts that brace a laminated beam above which helps to carry the weight of the floor joists. Stanchions for the milk herd are fitted between the posts, followed by a manure alley along the outer perimeter. The west side has a similar arrangement but there is a corncrib built {{into the middle of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>alley.</b> Finally, along the outer reaches of the west side, there are openings into the attached shed where pens could accommodate the storage of animals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three semi open free-stall barns (B 1, B 2, and B 3) for dairy cows with capacities for 120, 120 and 500 cows, respectively, from three different dairy farms (F- 1, F- 2 and F- 3), situated in Central Southern Bulgaria. The investigated farms had the same production system – loose housing in semi open free-stall dairy barn. For each of the farms the main microclimatic parameters – air temperature, relative humidity and speed of airflow were recorded twice a month at 10. 00 h 12. 00 h, 14. 00 h, 16. 00 h and 18. 00 h of the day inside the barns in three main technological zones - above the stalls, above manure and <b>feed</b> <b>alleys</b> and outside the buildings. It was found that: a) Microclimatic parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity and speed of airflow) in technological zones (above the stalls, the manure and <b>feed</b> <b>alleys)</b> of three semi open free-stall dairy barns meet the animal hygienic requirements for all seasons according to Regulation No. 44 (2006).

40|$|Twelve dairy herds with {{evidence}} of post-natal infection with Neospora caninum were compared with 21 control herds with no evidence of post-natal infection. On the former farms, dogs consumed placenta or licked uterine discharge in 75 and 67 % of the farms, respectively, while on control farms these activities occurred in 38 and 24 % of the farms, respectively. On all control farms and all but three post-natally infected farms the dogs were fed colostrum or milk. Defecation of dogs on the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley</b> was observed in 92 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 24 % of the control farms. The same trend was observed for defecation of dogs in grass silage, in 75 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 19 % of the control farms; and in corn silage, in 50 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 10 % of the control farms. Consumption of placenta, material of aborted foetuses or uterine discharge in combination with defecation on the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley,</b> storage of grass or corn silage was observed in 19 % of the control farms and in 75 % of the post-natally infected farms. This study supports the hypothesis that farm dogs may become infected by foetal fluids or placental material of infected cattle, and may subsequently cause a post-natal infection of cattle in the herd by shedding oocysts.

40|$|In modern dairy housing, {{flooring}} conditions lead to restricted locomotion and claw disorders. Epidemiological {{studies showed}} that housing on concrete floors {{was positively correlated with}} the incidence of lameness and claw disorders. Lameness and claw disorders constitute a significant health and welfare problem in modern dairy farming. Animals experience pain, are limited in their natural behaviour and can less easily meet their biological needs. The research in this thesis is focused on epidemiological and ethological aspects of claw disorders and disturbed locomotion with special emphasises on floor type and implications for animal welfare. The majority of the 1. 5 million dairy cows in The Netherlands are nowadays housed in cubicle houses with concrete stall floors. A small percentage of dairy cows are housed in straw yards. This housing system has a deep litter (straw-bedded) area where animals can rest collectively, accompanied by a concrete walking surface in front of the <b>feed</b> <b>alley.</b> At first, we investigated the claw health of more than 7500 dairy cows on different stall floors.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} consistency in competitive success across 3 common resources available to dairy cows housed in free-stall barns. Specifically, we determined if those cows that displaced other cows most often at the feed bunk (high-ranking) had priority of access to free-stalls or a mechanical brush. Our secondary {{objective was to}} determine if the displacements at each resource were a function of usage of that resource. These objectives were tested using 6 groups of 12 lactating dairy cows housed in pens with 0. 6 m of bunk space per cow, 1 free-stall per cow, and 1 mechanical brush per pen. Time-lapse video was used to quantify the time spent feeding, in the stalls, and using the mechanical brush. The incidence of displacements at the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> and lying area was measured for 3 d consecutively. Usage was lower for the brush, so displacements were monitored for 14 d consecutively. The individual measures of competitive success were not highly correlated between resources indicating a cow that frequently displaced other cows for access to one particular resource did not always do so when accessing the other resources. Competition at the feeder was responsible for 87. 6 +/- 1. 4 % of displacements observed throughout the experiment, indicating that gaining access to feed was a high priority for cows. These results suggest that competitive success by dairy cows may vary according to each cow's motivation to access the resource...|$|E

Fifty-one dairy farms with at least 70 Holstein milking cows and no access to pasture were selected from a list provided by the hoof trimmers from the Alberta Hoof Health Project. On these farms slipperiness and flooring type in the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley</b> and in the holding pen was recorded. Forty focal cows were gait scored (limping, head bob, asymmetric steps and tracking-up). In order to calculate odds ratios, farms were divided in groups: Farms with < 15 % of lame cows and farms with ≥ 15 % lame cows. Farms with < 25 % asymmetric cows and farms with ≥ 25 % asymmetric cows. Farms with < 60 % under-tracking cows and farms with ≥ 60 % under-tracking cows. Because of the small number of farms with other flooring than grooved concrete in the feeding area of the pen and in the holding pen, odds ratios could not be calculated.

These stresses include reduced dry matter intake, increased clinical mastitis and somatic cell count (SCC), reduced reproductive performance, feet problems caused by wet and muddy conditions, and lower milk production due to smaller calf sizes at birth. All of {{this is due to}} high temperatures and high humidity and high rainfall. This paper will deal with new facilities in Florida that try to relieve environmental stresses on dairy cattle. 2001 Study.

Visando à determinação do Índice de Temperatura do Globo e Umidade (ITGU) e da Carga Térmica de Radiação (CTR), foram instalados quatro globos negros, no centro de baias dispostas no sent ido transversal, dispondo dois globos no lado oeste e dois globos no lado leste (separados pelo corredor de alimentação). Lateralmente ao galpão, no lado leste, havia vegetação a 4 m da instalação, que promovia sombreamento nas primeiras horas do dia. Pode-se concluir que, nas primeiras horas do dia, não há diferença significativa entre os valores de ITGU e CTR encontrados, indicando que o sombreamento, devido à vegetação, foi capaz de amenizar os efeitos da radiação solar.

40|$|AbstractLameness is {{a severe}} welfare problem and a production-limiting disease in dairy farming. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine prevalence of lameness and investigate cow- and herd-level factors associated with lameness in dairy cows housed in freestall barns in 3 Canadian provinces. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein-Friesian cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Québec, Ontario, and Alberta. In total, 5, 637 cows were scored once for lameness (presence of limping when walking). Data collected included information on individual cows (hock lesions, claw length, body condition score, parity, days in milk, and milk production), management practices (floor and stall cleaning routine, bedding routine, and footbath practices), and facility design (stall dimensions, stall base and bedding type, width of <b>feed</b> <b>alley,</b> flooring type, and slipperiness) hypothesized to be risk factors for lameness. Multilevel mixed logistic regression models were constructed (including farm as a random effect and province as a fixed effect). Herd-level lameness prevalence ranged from 0 to 69 % (mean= 21 %). Lameness prevalence increased with increasing parity; compared with first parity, cows in parity 2, 3, and ≥ 4 had 1. 6, 3. 3, and 4 times, respectively, higher odds of being lame. Furthermore, the odds of lameness were 1. 6 times greater in cows with low body condition score (≤ 2. 5) than in cows with a higher body condition score. In addition, injured hocks and overgrown claws were associated with 1. 4 - and 1. 7 -fold increased odds of being lame, respectively, whereas every 1 kg increase in daily milk production was associated with a 3 % decrease in the odds of being lame. Lameness prevalence was higher in herds with ≤ 100 cows, but lower in barns with a sand or dirt stall base, or with bedding ≥ 2 cm deep. Cows exposed to very slippery floors had 2 times the odds of being lame compared with cows exposed to nonslippery floors. We attributed the wide range of lameness prevalence to the great variability in facilities and management practices among farms. Finally, we inferred that the prevalence of lameness could be decreased by improving management of multiparous, thin, or injured cows and by adopting management practices intended to improve cow comfort, namely the floor’s slip resistance and the stall’s lying surface...|$|E

To investigate this, groups of pregnant heifers were allocated to deep straw bedding (Soft) or cubicles (Hard), both with scraped concrete <b>feeding</b> <b>alleys.</b> After the grazing season, they were re-housed in cubicle systems, half on slatted concrete (Hard) and half on slatted rubber (Soft) alleys. Claw measurements, contact area and pressure distribution claw/flooring, claw disorders and leg lesions were recorded at the start and end of each housing season. Locomotion and leg lesions were also scored monthly after calving. Prevalence of sole haemorrhages was higher among pregnant heifers in cubicles than in deep straw. After calving, first-calvers on Hard floors had higher odds for lameness (OR = 3. 6; P < 0. 01), sole haemorrhages/ulcers (OR = 2. 2; P < 0. 05), white-line haemorrhages (OR = 2. 8; P < 0. 01) and leg lesions (OR = 2. 6; P < 0. 02) than those on Soft floors. Lowest prevalence and severity of sole and white-line haemorrhages (non-significant) in first-calvers was found in those on Soft floors and reared on Hard floors and the highest prevalence and severity on those on Hard floors reared on Soft floors.

40|$|Among {{the causes}} that {{influence}} cow welfare, heat stress induced by microclimatic conditions {{is one of}} the most relevant and many studies have investigated the efficacy of different cooling systems on animal health status. Nevertheless, the direct influence of the cooling systems on possible modifications of dairy cow behaviour has been addressed in a few studies and the related results were affected by the presence of a paddock, which gave a refuge from hot temperature. Since an alteration of the daily time budget spent by dairy cows in their usual activities can be associated with changes in their health status, this study investigated the effects of the alternation of two different cooling systems on lying, standing, and feeding behaviour of a group of dairy cows bred in a free-stall dairy house where animals had no access to a paddock. The barn was equipped with a fogging system associated with forced ventilation installed in the resting area and a sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation installed in the feeding area. The two systems were activated alternately. The results demonstrated that the management of the two cooling systems affected the analysed behaviours. Though the activation of the cooling system installed in the resting area encouraged the decubitus of animals in the stalls, the activation of that one of the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley</b> could not be able to influence the standing behaviour and had only a moderate positive influence on the feeding activity...|$|R
40|$|Eight dairy herds with {{evidence}} of post-natal transmission of Neospora caninum were {{used to test the}} hypothesis of a point source exposure by a retrospective analysis of the housing and feeding of infected age-groups. The first N. caninum-associated abortion or birth of N. caninum-seropositive offspring from the post-natally infected age-group was considered as the first indication of the infection. In seven of the eight dairy herds, a point source exposure to N. caninum of the infected age-groups was found during a limited period of common housing and feeding. In all herds studied, the analysis indicated that the cattle had been infected shortly before the first abortions occurred. In all, except one herd, the post-natal infection was more directly related to housing than to feeding. Therefore, it appeared that the feed was contaminated in the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley.</b> In one herd, the total mixed ration was found to be the probable path of infection. In all farms studied, a new dog (young, adult dog or litter) had been introduced within a period of 1. 5 years prior to the first indication of N. caninum infection in the cattle. As there was evidence in all herds of vertical transmission of neosporosis for years, it is hypothesized that the newly introduced dog was infected with N. caninum by materials from already infected cattle and subsequently transmitted the infection to other cattle by shedding of oocysts.

Seven lots of predominately black steers and heifers (4 and 3, respectively) visually determined to be approaching the final mo on feed were identified, randomly gate-sorted, and allocated to pens located across the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> from each other to receive 1 of 2 treatments: 1) Shade (mean shade area = 1. 5 m(2) /animal) or 2) No shade. Shade was provided using a 13 -ounce polyethylene fabric and pens were oriented northwest to southeast. The mean starting date was June 13 and the mean days on feed for lots while on the study was 38 d. Cattle were fed a 77. 67 % DM steam-flaked corn-based diet and had ad libitum access to water throughout the duration of the trial. Zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZIL) was included in the finishing ration at an inclusion rate of 8. 3 mg/kg of DM for the last 20 d on feed with a 3 d withdrawal period. Pen floor temperatures (PFT) were measured using an infrared thermometer and prevalence of cattle open-mouth breathing (OMB) was recorded on a pen basis. In addition to shade treatment, the effect of temperature humidity index (THI) on PFT and OMB was analyzed by classifying days as either "Alert" (THI 79). On the day of slaughter, pens within a replicate were kept separate through all stages of the marketing channel from loading at the feedlot until stunning at the plant. Pen served as the experimental unit for all measurements. There was a THI x shade treatment interaction for PFT and OMB (P 0. 05). Heat stress, a significant animal welfare concern and cause of reduced performance in feedlot cattle during the final phase of the feeding period, was alleviated in shaded cattle and illustrates the importance of shade provision as 1 tool to protect the welfare and increase feed consumption in large pens of feedlot cattle during hot summer months...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLying {{behavior}} {{is an important}} measure of comfort and well-being in dairy cattle, and changes in lying behavior are potential indicators and predictors of lameness. Our objectives were to determine individual and herd-level risk factors associated with measures of lying behavior, and to evaluate whether automated measures of lying behavior {{can be used to}} detect lameness. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Alberta, Ontario, and Québec. Lying behavior of 5, 135 cows between 10 and 120 d in milk was automatically and continuously recorded using accelerometers over 4 d. Data on factors hypothesized to influence lying behavior were collected, including information on individual cows, management practices, and facility design. Associations between predictor variables and measures of lying behavior were assessed using generalized linear mixed models, including farm and province as random and fixed effects, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to determine whether lying behavior was associated with lameness. At the cow-level, daily lying time increased with increasing days in milk, but this effect interacted with parity; primiparous cows had more frequent but shorter lying bouts in early lactation, changing to mature-cow patterns of lying behavior (fewer and longer lying bouts) in late lactation. In barns with stall curbs > 22 cm high, the use of sand or > 2 cm of bedding was associated with an increased average daily lying time of 1. 44 and 0. 06 h/d, respectively. Feed alleys ≥ 350 cm wide or stalls ≥ 114 cm wide were associated with increased daily lying time of 0. 39 and 0. 33 h/d, respectively, whereas rubber flooring in the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> was associated with 0. 47 h/d lower average lying time. Lame cows had longer lying times, with fewer, longer, and more variable duration of bouts compared with nonlame cows. In that regard, cows with lying time ≥ 14 h/d, ≤ 5 lying bouts per day, bout duration ≥ 110 min/bout, or standard deviations of bout duration over 4 d ≥ 70 min had 3. 7, 1. 7, 2. 5, and 3. 0 higher odds of being lame, respectively. Factors related to comfort of lying and standing surfaces significantly affected lying behavior. Finally, we inferred that automated measures of lying behavior could contribute to lameness detection, especially when interpreted in the context of other factors known to affect lying behavior, including those associated with the individual cow (e. g., parity and stage of lactation) or environment (e. g., stall surface) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research study which had the objective of investigating the effect of a sprinkler system coupled with forced ventilation on the heat stress of dairy cows bred in a free stall barn without paddock. To this aim, an experiment was carried out inside a free-stall dairy house equipped with two different cooling systems: a fogging system associated with forced ventilation in the resting area and a sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation in the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley.</b> The experiment regarded two adjacent pens of the barn and was constituted by three different trials carried out in the following periods: 27 th June - 7 th July (P 1), 25 th July - 4 th August (P 2), 24 th August - 3 rd September (P 3). The experimental protocol of each trial required that the treatment group was housed in one pen where the two cooling systems were always activated following an established timetable, whereas the control group was housed in the other pen, where the sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation was always deactivated. Climatic parameters were measured inside each pen of the barn and outside. Then, thermal humidity index (THI) was calculated. Rectal temperature and respiration rate of a sample of dairy cows were monitored each day during the three periods considered (P 1, P 2 and P 3). During the three trials the cows of both groups were subjected to climatic conditions that resulted in average daily THI values between 72. 8 and 74. 7, corresponding to mild or moderate heat stress. However, during daytime, air temperature and relative humidity reached values corresponding to a severe heat stress, as attested by the maximum THI values that were higher than or very close to 80. Furthermore, it was observed that the sprinklers do not influence the microclimatic conditions. However, the physiological parameters values of the treatment group were always significantly lower than the corresponding ones of the control group. Specifically, the system especially influenced the respiration rate that, in the treatment group, was close to 50 breath/min, while in the control group it reached 70 breath/min. The sprinkler system had more limited effects on rectal temperature that, however, in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group (38. 7 °C to 38. 8 °C vs 39. 1 °C to 39. 4 °C) in all the three periods of the experiment.

40|$|Biological rhythms are an {{essential}} regulator of life. There {{is evidence that}} circadian rhythm of activity is disrupted under chronic stress in animals and humans, and {{it may also be}} less marked during diseases. Here we investigated whether a detectable circadian rhythm of activity exists in dairy cows in commercial settings using a real-time positioning system. We used CowView (GEA Farm Technologies) to regularly record the individual positions of 350 cows in a Danish dairy farm over 5 nio and to infer the cows' activity (resting, <b>feeding,</b> in <b>alley).</b> We ran a factorial correspondence analysis on the cows' activities and used the first component of this analysis to express the variations in activity. On this axis, the activities obtained the following weights: resting = - 0. 15; in alleys = + 0. 12; feeding = + 0. 34. By applying these weights to the proportions of time each cow spent on each of the 3 activities, we were able to chart a circadian rhythm of activity. We found that average level of activity of a cow on a given clay and its variations during that day varied with specific states (i. e., estrus, lameness, mastitis). More specifically, circadian variations in activity appeared to be particularly sensitive and to vary 1 to 2 d before the farmer detected a. disorder. These findings offer promising avenues for further research to design models to predict physiological or pathological states of cows from real-time positioning data...|$|R
40|$|Each year, a {{large number}} of persons active in farming, are {{affected}} by work-load injuries.

If this time can be reduced, more time will be left for animal care. In piglet production, the one and same box, the farrowing- and suckling-period-box, shall fit several categories of animals. Thus the claims for functionality and flexibility are extra high. The purpose of this thesis was to elucidate the physical work load at daily recurrent tasks in piglet production. Furthermore, the possible connections between work load and box and degree of mecanization were studied. The aim was to identify demands on functionality and to suggest solutions for designing or choosing a box that ensures both a good animal environment and a low work load. A literature review was done in order to elucidate which the laws, regulations and recommendations issued concerning pig production were as well as what previous theses and investigations concerning time consumption in different systems for housing pigs and health effects from working in pig production that had been done. The practical part of the study was performed through visiting twelve stock-breeders during spring and summer in 1997. Eleven of these were situated in the county of Skåne and one in Uppsala. Two of the stock-breeders had two different kinds of boxes each. This resulted in a total of 14 studies performed. The studies were performed by the WOPALAS-method supplemented with studies of time consumption, routines and long-term-consequenses for the locomotive organs. WOPALAS shows the need to undertake measurements for each work operation and body part. Supplementing the WOPALAS study with the time consumption and routines gave a more complete picture of the work situation. The study of the long-term-consequences facilitated the WOPALAS-analysis. At the same time, it gave a description of troubles from the locomotive organs. At the visits to the stock-breeders time consumption and routines were noted down at the same time as all work with cleansing from manure, strewing with bedding-straw and feeding was video-recorded. The films were then analysed with an observation interval of three seconds. Each person studied answered the standardized Nordic questionnaire concerning problems from the locomotive organs. One stock-breeder was visited per day. A large number of stock-breeders had equipment from Alfa Laval Agri Scandinavia. To facilitate, all studied boxes are called by the names used by Alfa Laval Agri Scandinavia. The boxes studied were Ekoboxen, Harmoni A, Harmoni A+, Harmoni C, Rosenlid with open drain for manure and Rosenlid with raised draining floor. Nine of the twelwe persons studied had had troubles from the locomotive organs during the last year. The three problem-free persons were all below 20 years of age and had not been working in pig production for more than two months or were extras. That ergonomical problems in pig production are an important area of research is evident. Most common were troubles from lower back, neck and shoulders. The cleansing from manure took the longest time and required the largest number of steps to be taken concerning the work postures in Harmoni A+ and Rosenlid with open drain. It demanded least time and had the lowest need for undertaking measurements in the Ekoboxes. The middle positions were occupied by Harmoni A, Harmoni C and Rosenlid with raised draining floor. The strewing of bedding-straw was performed with different kinds of devices. Studies have been performed where no devices were used, where baskets and buckets were used and where wheel-cans or rail-carts were used. The largest demand for steps to be taken regarding work positions were found when a wheel-cart was used. At the same time, that alternative have the second lowest time consumption. The time consumption and the demand for actions regarding work postures were lowest where baskets and buckets were used. Rail-cart and strewing of the bedding-straw without devices occupied the middle positions regarding need to undertake measurements but demanded more time than the other alternatives. The degree of mecanization regarding feeding had a distinct relationship with time consumption and work load. At stock-breeders where the feeding was done manually it required most time and had many work positions with a need to undertake measurements. At stock-breeders where the feeding was mecanized and automatically controlled, no time was used for feeding in the daily work. Consequently no work load came about. The stock-breeders where the feeding was mecanized but not automatically controlled occupied the middle position. The work operation demanded little time and the demand for actions regarding work positions were low. The following conclusions were drawn. The individual and the stable system and the interferance between them decided the work situation, see figure below. Stable system means the kind of boxes used, the degree of mecanization and automation, the planning of the building and the devices used, for example rakes, scoops for feed-stuff and carts for bedding-straw. The stable system gave the frame within wich the individual could choose his routines. Routines and in what way the work was done decided the time consumption. Time consumption and way of working gave the work load. Together, time consumption, work load and way of working decided the work situation. There is also a feed-back function in the system. If the individual finds the work situation unsatisfactory he can for example change the routines. It is important that the pig house is planned to facilitate good routines. The demand for good routines are important both for daily tasks and for work operations that are performed less frequently. The boxes too must be well planned. For example should it be easy for the worker to enter and exit the box at the same time as the pigs should be kept in the box. To use devices well adapted to their use and the physical stature of the worker facilitates work. Quite a number of the persons studied asked for education concerning ergonomy. This could be done for example by Skogs- och Lantbrukshälsan. The education should be adapted to the participants pig housing systems and have a practical connection. In the end of the thesis a number of observations of practical nature from the visits to the stock-breeders are accounted of. l. The box-gates must be easy to open. It’s often difficult to get up the lock peg, especially if the sow when rubbing herself against the gate has bent the peg. At the same time the pigs must not be able to open the gate themselves. 2. Straight corners inside the box make the manure pile up. Boards inside the box which are of no practical use should be taken away. 3. Correctly placed guard-rails are important to prevent the sow from squeezing the piglets. 4. The box-equipment must stand up to the strains when for example a sow scratches herself. Welds must be well done and board material must not be too poorly dimensioned. 5. The cleaning of the aisles is facilitated if the corner between the floor in the aisles and the front of the box is straight. If the lower part of the outside of the manger is indrawn, a corner that is difficult to keep clean, is formed in the aisle. The manger should therefor be manufactured with straight edges along the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley.</b> 6. The pigs must not be able to open the hatches in the draining floors by themselves. Chasing piglets in the manure-drain doesn’t promote the working situation. The sow can also get hurt if she gets the hatch open...|$|R
40|$|Although {{trees and}} {{livestock}} are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, {{this was not}} always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building timber from the same area of land. What are the benefits of such systems today in the Tropics? In recent years, increasing pressure on land in tropical countries has resulted in massive deforestation with consequent erosion and reduction in soil fertility as well as serious shortages of fuelwood. This has convinced many agricultural scientists that trees have a crucial {{role to play in}} tropical agriculture and that they should not be confined to intensive plantations but should instead be integrated with arable agriculture and livestock husbandry. Integration of livestock and trees makes excellent sense for farmers in tropical countries, both in terms of intensification of land use and economic security. Because animals provide traction and manure in addition to meat, milk and hides, their inclusion in the farming system actually increases crop production. They need not compete for land with crops, so long as adequate forage is available throughout the year. In addition to the advantages mentioned above leguminous trees, which fix nitrogen, can provide protein-rich leaves as supplements for ruminants and pigs, and nutritious browse during periods when other feeds are unavailable. (See CTA Activities, Spore 31 'Caribbean livestock: improving health and nutrition'). Farming systems that integrate trees with livestock In the semi-arid areas of Africa both pastoralists and farmers encourage the growth of acacia trees; the highly nutritious foliage and pods provide an important source of dry fodder for their animals. In the Sahel one species, Acacia albida, is particularly important since it produces green foliage throughout the dry season when other sources of forage are scarce. An abundant crop of nutritious pods is also produced {{at the end of the}} dry season, when the need for fodder is greatest, and a single tree will produce between 50 and 150 kg of pods per year. Similarly, in the semi-arid highlands of the Haraghe region of Ethiopia a traditional agroforestry system based on A. albida has evolved. Estimates of the additional income resulting from growing the trees in the farmers' gelds suggest that the value of produce (cereal grain and stover, fuel-wood and fodder) increases in proportion with the cover of the tree canopy. At a planting rate of 20 trees per hectare, the additional value of the produce (compared with fields without trees) was equivalent to US$ 230 per hectare per year and the total value of the fodder produced was about $ 370 per hectare per year. To date, tree-planting in semi-arid areas has mainly been done in the context of fuelwood and erosion control programmes and the benefits to agriculture are poorly documented. Nevertheless, species suitable for semi-arid areas of the highlands of East Africa have been identified by the International Council for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) at Machakos in Kenya. They include Leucaena, Acacia albida, A. tortilis, Sesbania sesban, S. bispinosa, Prosopis juliflora and P. pallida. Not all of these have been tested in farmers' fields but recent experiments in a semi-arid region of India using leucaena in mixed sorghum and livestock smallholdings gave remarkable improvements in sorghum yields and provided a valuable source of fodder and firewood. Here, leucaena was planted in rows 6 m apart with sorghum planted between. The trees were pollarded at 2 m height immediately before planting the sorghum, and the leaves were fed with sorghum stover to cattle. The researchers found that the value of produce from the leucaena/sorghum combination was about one third greater than that from sorghum alone and that income from the forage accounted for about 20 % of the total value. Another way in which trees and livestock can be integrated is by growing forage under tree plantations. This is widely practised in Goats browsing on leucaena the Pacific region, where both cattle and small ruminants are grazed under coconut plantations; in S. E. Asia, in rubber and coconut plantations; and, to a smaller extent, in West Africa in oil palm plantations. Grazing animals in plantations has a number of advantages for smallholder farmers. Under-utilized land and labour are made more productive and farm income is increased. With careful management, improvements in growth and yield of the tree crop can be achieved and considerable savings can be made in costs of herbicides to control ground-cover herbage. Because the market price of the produce from tree crops (particularly copra and coconut oil) fluctuates widely, inclusion of livestock in the system provides a buffer against falling prices. Since tree crops take a minimum of 6 to 7 years before coming into economic production, a combination of forage and food crops intercropped with young trees can help to offset the costs of establishing plantations. Finally, the cooler temperatures under tree plantations can provide a better microclimate for animal production than unshaded areas. Studies carried out in S. E. Asia and the Pacific illustrate the benefits of integrating livestock with coconut production. In southern India, the net return from smallholder coconut plantations was calculated as approximately US$ 350 per hectare per year, but when milk cattle were included net returns increased to $ 942 per year. Likewise, in the Philippines a recent comparison of the relative returns to coconut plantations alone and coconuts with beef cattle showed that inclusion of cattle more than doubles net returns, from $ 159 to $ 327 per farm per year. Inclusion of improved forages can often dramatically increase liveweight gains and profits from livestock in plantations. In the New Hebrides, planting guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and forage sorghum under coconut resulted in a ninefold increase in profits from livestock as compared with unimproved native pasture species. In much of humid S. E. Asia the creeping legumes calopo and puero (originally introduced to plantations as ground cover to control weeds) provide nutritious fodder for animals and there is considerable scope for improving pastures under plantations with these and other forage legumes. Alley cropping The third example of integrating trees with agriculture is a more recent development which has not yet been widely adopted by farmers in the Tropics. However, many agriculturalists think alley cropping has immense potential for stabilizing and improving smallholder farming. Traditional agriculture in the Tropics relies on the bush fallow system of shifting cultivation to restore soil fertility. Following forest clearance and cultivation, the litter from the dense growth of shrubs which develops on fallow land restores soil organic matter, the key to maintaining fertility. This system has maintained crop yields and soil fertility on the fragile soils of the humid tropics for millennia, but more recently growing populations have led to increasing demand for food, resulting in shortened fallow periods. The consequences for soil fertility and crop yields have been disastrous. Within living memory, average crop yields in parts of humid West Africa have almost halved, and in some areas cultivated land has even been abandoned as a result. Scientists from the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), at Ibadan in Nigeria, have tested a system to replace shifting cultivation that would allow continuous cropping without the resulting loss in soil fertility. Alley cropping consists of hedges of fast-growing shrubs interplanted with food crops. Using nitrogen-fixing leguminous shrubs such as leucaena or gliricidia, crop yields have been maintained at reasonable levels over several years, without the need for a fallow period. The system has several advantages. The shrubs provide green manure or mulch for companion crops, a source of stakes and firewood and, most importantly, biologically-fixed nitrogen to maintain and enhance soil fertility. Additionally, alleys planted along the contours on sloping ground can help to prevent soil erosion. Researchers from the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA), who also worked at Ibadan, realized that this system might also provide a means of improving productivity of sheep and goats in humid Africa, where forest sheep and dwarf goats are traditionally raised. Because they are fed only on kitchen refuse and agricultural by-products, such as cassava leaves, their productivity is low and surplus meat is rarely produced. Demand for fresh meat in the towns of West Africa is increasingly met largely by expensive beef. If the productivity of local small ruminants could be raised, a large and easily accessible market for meat would be available to farmers. Problems and outlook for integrating livestock and trees The leaves of both leucaena and gliricidia are highly nutritious for small ruminants and are produced throughout the dry season in humid regions, a period when other forages are scarce. Trials in which grass supplemented with varying quantities of leucaena or gliricidia leaves was fed to West African dwarf sheep show that inclusion in the diet of only 800 grammes of leaves per day increased liveweight gain by 30 % and survival of the young by 26 %. After some initial reluctance, many local farmers have adopted the idea of <b>feeding</b> browse from <b>alleys</b> to their animals, so that in only five years over 60 farmers in the Ibadan region established new alley farms. One of the advantages of the system is that it allows farmers freedom of choice as to how they use browse, either as fertilizer for crops or feed for animals, according to their own needs and the relative price of meat versus food crops. Following the initial success of alley farming in the Ibadan region, ILCA has started a network throughout West Africa to promote integration of trees and livestock. The examples that have been described suggest that integration of livestock husbandry with trees could provide major benefits for farmers in ACP countries. But it would be wrong to assume that there are no problems to be overcome and that the future of agroforestry in the Tropics is guaranteed. One general problem, particularly in Africa, is that of communal land tenure. Where farmers do not have individual tenure rights, the incentive to plant trees, which have long-term production cycles, is very low. This is probably one of the reasons for the relatively slow uptake of alley farming in West Africa, where much land is held communally or by tenant farmers. Likewise, in humid areas where the natural regrowth is dense bush, there may be considerable reluctance by farmers to plant shrubs or trees on land which they have recently spent much effort on clearing for food crops. Furthermore, in densely populated areas, such as the highlands of East Africa, land is already intensively used and any new management system needs careful on-farm testing to ensure that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages in actual practice. Also, where a completely new system such as alley farming is introduced, farmers may lack the management skills in both agroforestry and animal husbandry which are necessary to maintain productivity. Apart from such social and economic constraints, technical problems may also restrict opportunities for integrating livestock with trees. In many tropical areas animal diseases are a major problem. Much of the humid forest region of Africa is infested with tsetse fly, and only trypanosomiasis-resistant animals can be raised. In the same area, the disease PPR ('Peste des petite ruminants') causes serious weight loss and abortion in sheep and goats and the advantages of alley farming can only be fully exploited if animals are regularly vaccinated against the disease. When livestock are grazed in tree plantations, competition for nutrients and water between the trees and the pasture may result in poor establishment of one or other of the two components. There is often initially a considerable problem in preventing animals damaging young trees and then, as the tree canopy develops, in preventing overgrazing and maintaining a healthy sward in the heavily-shaded conditions. In this situation, careful regulation of stocking rates is essential and requires considerable livestock management skills. In the drier areas of the Tropics, competition between trees and pasture for limited soil moisture can also be a problem. There is also a pressing need to identify tree species that can grow well under the poor and erratic rainfall conditions encountered in such areas. Despite all these problems, the integration of livestock farming with trees in the Tropics is likely to expand for a variety of reasons. In many areas, deforestation has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and timber as well as serious soil erosion. While the conventional response of establishing fuel-wood plantations can provide a partial solution, shortage of land for food crops places a limit on the area that can be planted. Integration of trees in farmland simultaneously provides fuel and helps to control erosion. Including an animal component in the system not only provides meat, milk and hides but manure and traction as well. In many areas of the tropics, demand for meat and milk products far outstrips supply and the deficit is met by expensive imports paid for with scarce foreign currency. Self-sufficiency in livestock products should be seen as a national goal as well as an important source of farm income. However, as was stressed in the introduction, integration of livestock and trees should not be seen in isolation from the farming system as a whole. Only if the new technologies are carefully tailored to the particular requirements of individual farming communities are they likely to prove acceptable. It is in this respect that agroforestry is likely to provide the major challenge to agricultural scientists and extension workers alike in the 21 st century. Although trees and livestock are not closely-linked components of modem western agricultural systems, this was not always the case. Traditional 'woodpasture' systems were widespread in Europe and allowed production of meat, firewood and building [...] ...|$|R
