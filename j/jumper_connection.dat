40|$|The Short Straight Section (SSS) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may undergo {{relative}} displacements between cold-mass and cryostat for {{the following}} three reasons: - Fabrication tolerance of interconnection bellows - Global smoothing after pre-alignment - Ground motion in a sector of the LHC tunnel The forces responsible for such displacements stem from finite stiffness of interconnect bellows & metal hoses of the internal piping of the <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> and from relatively flexible 'glass fibre reinforced epoxy' (GFRE) composite supports of the cold mass. In addition, the vacuum jacket of the <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> and the large sleeves attached to both ends of SSS produce elastic deformations of the cryostat vessel. A unified finite element model consisting of cryostat, large sleeves, vacuum jacket of jumper, interconnection bellows, internal piping of jumper, composite cold supports and alignment jacks has been prepared. The knowledge {{of the position of}} the cold mass with respect to its cryostat under various conditions of alignment done using external fiducials mounted on the cryostat is essential. The maximum relative displacement for satisfactory machine operation is 0. 1 mm. An SSS with cryogenic <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> has been modelled with the aim of assessing this possible displacement...|$|E
40|$|The lattice of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{contains}} 364 Short Straight Section (SSS) units, one {{in every}} 53 m long half-cell. An SSS consists of three major assemblies: the standard cryostat section, the cryogenic service module, and the <b>jumper</b> <b>connection.</b> The standard cryostat section of an SSS contains the twin aperture high-gradient superconducting quadrupole and two pairs of superconducting corrector magnets, operating in pressurized helium II at 1. 9 K. Components for isolating cryostat insulation vacuum, and the cryogenic supply lines, have to be foreseen. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} design changes of the SSS following adoption of an external cryogenic supply line (QRL). A <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> connects the SSS to the QRL, linking all the cryogenic tubes necessary for the local full-cell cooling loop [at every second SSS]. The jumper is connected to one end of the standard cryostat section via the cryogenic service module, which also houses beam diagnostics, current feedthroughs, and instrumentation capillaries. The conceptual design fulfilling the tight requirements of magnet alignment precision and cryogenic performance are described. Construction details, aimed at minimizing costs of series manufacturing and assembly, while ensuring the high quality of this complex accelerator component, are given...|$|E
50|$|Unlike Cape Town's and Durban's {{suburban}} trainsets, {{those working}} around Johannesburg had <b>jumper</b> <b>connections</b> {{on the roof}} above the end connecting doors. The Class 3Es were also equipped with these connections, immediately to the right hand side of each headlight. During a shortage of suburban motor coaches c. 1948-1949, Class 3Es were used to haul suburban sets on the Witwatersrand {{and it is likely}} that the electric heating system was used during those winters. In the picture alongside showing rarely seen snow on the ground along the Johannesburg-Pretoria line on the Transvaal Highveld, the roof <b>jumper</b> <b>connections</b> between the suburban coaches and next to the unit's headlight are visible.|$|R

40|$|During {{more than}} five years a close {{collaboration}} between CERN and CEA-Saclay led to the development and construction of two prototype quadrupole magnets and the integration of one of them into the short straight section of the LHC half-cell test string at CERN. In the frame of the special host country contribution to the LHC project this collaboration has been extended to the CNRS laboratory in Orsay and covers besides the quadrupole magnets the complete cold mass assembly (CEA) and the integration into the short straight section cryostat (CNRS). The short straight sections include not only the main lattice quadrupoles with their protection diodes, they also house different corrector magnets and the beam position monitors. Further, they provide the cryogenic feed units for a half-cell with all the magnet interconnections and the <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> to the separate cryo-line. The paper will show the general lay-out of these complex units and elaborate the different aspects of their assembly...|$|E
40|$|Liquid and Gaseous Helium are {{supplied}} to the superconducting magnets of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), presently being assembled at CERN, by a cryogenic distribution line (QRL). The cryogenic module of the twin-quadrupole Short Straight Section (SSS) is supplied with these cryogens through a <b>jumper</b> <b>connection</b> linking the service module of the QRL and the SSS. The internal {{as well as}} external features of the jumper construction allow for relative displacements between the QRL and SSS with sufficient flexibility to reduce the reaction forces responsible for elastic deformations when the SSS is moved for alignment. The SSS is composed of a cold mass and of a vacuum vessel equipped with fiducials posted on the external vacuum vessel reinforcement rings allowing the precise alignment of the machine when the cryostat is finally closed. A deformation of the structure linking the cold mass and the external vacuum vessel resulting from reaction forces induced by relative displacements of the SSS and the QRL, if unpredictable, would result in an unacceptable misalignment of the quadrupole magnetic axis. A unified FE model was generated at RRCAT to study the elastic behavior of the SSS under the conditions of alignment. This model was validated using a 40 meter long dedicated test setup at CERN. Correlations in the matrix form were generated so that all displacements of the cold mass {{can be related to}} the corresponding movements done for alignment. This transfer function, linking the action on the SSS external alignment jacks and the position of the cold mass will be used to properly align the machine in operation...|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), {{currently}} under construction at CERN, will {{make use of}} superconducting magnets operating in superfluid helium below 2 K. The reference cryogenic distribution scheme was based, in each 3. 3 km sector served by a cryogenic plant, on a separate cryogenic distribution line which feeds elementary cooling loops corresponding {{to the length of}} a half-cell (53 m). In order to decrease the number of active components, cryogenic modules and <b>jumper</b> <b>connections</b> between distribution line and magnet strings a simplified cryogenic scheme is now implemented, based on cooling loops corresponding to the length of a full-cell (107 m) and compatible with the LHC requirements. Performance and redundancy limitations are discussed with respect to the previous scheme and balanced against potential cost savings...|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, it {{is noted}} that other letter designations were used {{temporarily}} involving an extra [...] "A" [...] preceding the unit name. This was done as Standards were being modified {{in regard to}} their <b>jumper</b> cable <b>connections.</b> This work went on from approximately 1928 to 1931, and during those years one could see units carrying designations [...] "AA," [...] "AB," [...] or [...] "ABX." [...] The extra [...] "A" [...] signified that the car had been so equipped. These designations with the extra [...] "A" [...] prefix were temporary, and when the entire fleet of Standards had been so equipped by 1931 or 1932, the extra [...] "A" [...] prefix was dropped from the designations.|$|R
50|$|Basically a {{rotary switch}} {{construction}} set, the Geniac contained six perforated masonite disks, {{into the back}} of which brass jumpers could be inserted. The <b>jumpers</b> made electrical <b>connections</b> between slotted brass bolt heads sitting out from the similarly perforated masonite back panel. To the bolts were attached wires behind the panel. The circuit comprised a battery, such wires from it to, and between, switch positions, wires from the switches to indicator flashlight bulbs set along the panel's middle, and return wires to the battery to complete the circuit.|$|R
40|$|Structures, {{stability}} and electronic properties of AA-stacking bigraphene with holes are studied using molecular mechanic and DFT method calculations. It {{has been shown}} the zig-zag edges of considered elon-gated holes lead to armchair sp 2 -nanotube-type connection between these two edges forming all sp 2 -structure. We consider similar periodic structures with (n,n) nanotubes formed among elongated holes and connected with bigraphene fragments, which edges are also closed edges. The {{stability and}} electronic prop-erties of these structures are investigated. Band structures of considered materials have energy gaps 0. 20 - 0. 27 eV {{in the direction of}} tube axes through <b>jumpers</b> on the <b>connections,</b> and Dirac-like point views in the opposite direction.
