5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b>|$|E

That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E

500|$|There {{is a broad}} {{practical}} bent to {{both the}} Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to Programming Perl begins: [...] "Perl is a language for getting your job done." [...] One consequence {{of this is that}} Perl is not a tidy language. It includes many features, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Because of the forgiving nature of the compiler, bugs can sometimes be hard to find. Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, [...] "In general, they <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> unless you want consistency." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had already}} raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so?' I was like c'mon man we got to stop {{treating}} rap like oh it came out it's dead. When it's good, we have to make people love it and digest it. We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've {{never been in a}} situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. If you try to force him to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with the}} {{announcement}} of the Ballroom Blitz Tour in March 2010, the title for the new album was revealed as [...] Later that month, Munky announced that Korn has officially signed to Roadrunner Records. Jonathan Davis later confirmed the record deal: [...] "We're going to go to Roadrunner. [...] real exciting for us, too, because they're one of the last record companies to let you <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do." [...] Davis continued, [...] "All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now." [...] The lead single, [...] "Oildale", was made available for streaming in May 2010. [...] "Oildale (Leave Me Alone)" [...] was simultaneously released to radio stations, and became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Active rock and Mainstream Rock airplay charts. A music video, directed by Phil Mucci, received an exclusive premiere on MTV2.|$|E
500|$|The first {{track on}} the EP, [...] "Smokin'", was {{commissioned}} by British television station Channel 4 for a programme about sloth presented by Howard Marks {{as part of a}} series on the seven deadly sins. The band went into Grassroots, a community recording studio in Cardiff, in June 1997 and looped a sample of the Black Uhuru track [...] "I Love King Selassie", playing along and writing [...] "Smokin'" [...] "completely spontaneously". According to singer Gruff Rhys the song is [...] "really light and up" [...] as a result of being recorded in the summer. The track's lyrics refer to smoking cannabis, with Rhys stating that it [...] "seems ridiculous that you can't <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> with a plant that grows naturally" [...] in reference to the drug's illegal status in many countries. Rhys has claimed that he does not consider the track to be subversive, however — it is about the band's own drug use and he doesn't [...] "expect everyone who buys the record to do the same. They'd be quite sad if they did".|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} about Armageddon Sebastian spoke {{of how much}} The Memphis Album still influences his music, [...] "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched {{in that sort of}} environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. <b>Do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe said: [...] "Sometimes {{it takes}} four records, with a detour into [...] "concepts" [...] covers {{territory}} to find where you fit. Sebastian has found his niche with Like It Like That, which expertly balances {{the line between}} radio friendly pop and classic soul". Paul Cashmere from Undercover wrote: [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation." [...] In an interview {{for the release of}} his seventh album Armageddon, Sebastian spoke of how much The Memphis Album still influences his music: [...] "I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me.

2500|$|Regarding his {{political}} views, Carolla has stated, [...] "I guess I would be Republican, {{in the sense}} that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." [...] He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically liberal causes such as the legalization of marijuana and support for as well some progressive causes such as [...] "... against semi-automatic and automatic weapons. I'm not an NRA guy {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants."

2500|$|Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamers review {{stated that}} the jump timing {{sometimes}} feels [...] "off by {{a fraction of a}} fraction of a second" [...] and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In IGNs review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay [...] "left a few corners on {{what should have been a}} razor-sharp control scheme". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right. There's times when it annoys me actually." [...] He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended [...] "in a somewhat disappointing manner" [...] and the story as a whole doesn't make sense.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gaskarth, [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)" [...] is a up-tempo {{track that}} begins the album with [...] "a great guitar hook {{and lots of}} energy."

Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people have been together for a really long time and they're afraid to let go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to say and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> no matter what the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|E
