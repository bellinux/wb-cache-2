25|$|Sport is {{compulsory}} for {{all students}} up {{to the age of}} sixteen, but the amount of time devoted to it is often small. There are frequent complaints that state sector schools <b>do</b> <b>too</b> little to encourage sport and a healthy lifestyle. In the 1980s, the government sold many schools sports fields to housing developers; as such, many older schools do not have outdoor facilities readily available.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in {{the eyes}} of investors the VOC did not <b>do</b> <b>too</b> badly. The share price hovered {{consistently}} around the 400 mark from the mid-1680s (excepting a hiccup around the Glorious Revolution in 1688), and they reached an all-time high of around 642 in the 1720s. VOC shares then yielded a return of 3.5 percent, only slightly less than the yield on Dutch government bonds.|$|E
25|$|SGML found wide {{acceptance}} and use in fields with very large-scale documentation requirements. However, many found it cumbersome {{and difficult to}} learn—a side effect of its design attempting to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much and be too flexible. For example, SGML made end tags (or start-tags, or even both) optional in certain contexts, because its developers thought markup would be done manually by overworked support staff who would appreciate saving keystrokes.|$|E

25|$|Dravid scored 81 runs in {{the first}} innings of the third test and took 4 catches in the match as India {{defeated}} Australia at Chennai in a nail biting finish to clinch the series 2–1. Although Dravid did exceptionally well in the series scoring 338 runs {{at an average of}} 56.33, the series cost him the coveted no. 3 position in the Indian batting line-up. Dravid scored 80 in the first of the 5 match ODI series at his home ground as India won the match by 60 runs. He didn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> well in the remaining 4 ODIs as Australia won the series 3–2.|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} Test debut in England, Dravid {{played in the}} one-off Test against Australia in Delhi – his first Test in India. Batting at no. 6, he scored 40 runs in the first innings. Dravid batted at no. 3 position {{for the first time}} in the First Test of the three-match home series against South Africa in Ahmedabad in November 1996. However, he was made to shuffle through the batting order for the rest of the series. He didn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> well in the series scoring just 175 runs at an average of 29.16 and was the third best Indian batsman in the series that India won 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, a {{new series}} can be created as a {{deliberate}} offshoot from a parent series. This can also occur in two ways. One method was to take a supporting character from an existing series and start {{a new series}} with that character in the lead (sometimes with the lead character from the original series appearing in a cameo). Two examples are Judge Anderson, first introduced in Judge Dredd, being given her own series, Anderson: Psi Division, five years later; and Durham Red getting her own series after her debut in Strontium Dog. Since Judge Dredd and Strontium Dog occupy the same universe, it follows that Anderson and Red <b>do</b> <b>too</b> (although they have never both appeared in the same story).|$|E
25|$|Dravid {{became the}} first Indian batsman to score {{hundreds}} in four consecutive Test innings when he scored 100 not out against West Indies {{in the first of}} the three match home series at Wankhede. Severe cramps and dehydration forced Dravid to leave his inning midway soon after he completed his hundred as he retired hurt on 100 to get drips administered to himself. India won the test by innings and 112 runs. Dravid didn't <b>do</b> <b>too</b> well in the remaining two tests ending with a modest series aggregate of 148 runs at an average of 49.33. Dravid did well in the subsequent bilateral 7-match ODI series. He topped Indian averages for the series scoring 300 runs at an average of 75 and a strike rate of 89.82 including one hundred and two fifties. He also effected 7 dismissals (6 catches, 1 stumping) – most by a wicketkeeper in the series. In the 4th ODI, West Indies set India an improbable target of 325 runs to win the match. Dravid scored a solid hundred and forged an unbeaten partnership with Bangar as India won the match by 5 wickets levelling the series 2–2. He once again scored an important fifty in the 6th match when India were down in the series 2–3, helping India win the match and level the series 3–3. India, however, lost the last match to lose the series 3–4.|$|E

The premiere was watched by 4.90 million viewers, higher than any {{episode of the}} entire second half of season two. Overall, the season had generally consistent ratings, and received positive reviews; critics felt the series had 'hit its stride' with the season, and particularly praised the risky bottle episode [...] "4,722 Hours", though the pacing of the season received criticism for trying to <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much at times.
