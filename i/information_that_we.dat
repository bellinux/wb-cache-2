The identification was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests, and physical characteristics of the skeleton consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance. Osteoarchaeologist Jo Appleby commented: [...] "The skeleton {{has a number of}} unusual features: its slender build, the scoliosis, and the battle-related trauma. All of these are highly consistent with the <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have about Richard III in life and about the circumstances of his death." ...|$|E

In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell.

The insufficient <b>informations</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> receive from Pliny (nat. hist. 3, 46) have led to quite distant interpretations. Some scholars think that the regions had a purely statistic role, based on census (Mommsen, Nicolet, Laffi); for others, they were districts for the administration of public lands and imperial properties (Marquardt, De Martino). In this paper it is argued that the Augustan regions were territorial districts whose role was to convey the local data to the central admini-stration, probably including also lists of imperial lands; and it is questioned the possibility of a comparison between the Augustan invention and the administrative function of the modern regions...|$|R
