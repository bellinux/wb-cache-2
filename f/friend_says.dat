500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my <b>friend</b> <b>says</b> I have to be more interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, basically, we knew the outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to [...] "focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view", and show the characters [...] "just behaving ... not inhabiting positions." ...|$|E
2500|$|After ending {{her career}} in adult videos, Iijima {{released}} a musical single [...] in July 1993 and soon became a regular on daytime TV talk shows. Before long, she {{became one of the}} most successful tarento to make the transition from pornography into mainstream entertainment. In December 1993, she debuted in mainstream film playing an angel come down to earth in the Toei Company fantasy [...] She even provided the story for her own manga series, Time Traveler Ai, in which she was featured as the main character. Publicly, Iijima became known for her outspokenness and ability to speak frankly about her past and her personal life. Privately, a <b>friend</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "At first glance, Ai appears really rough around the edges, but she's actually really sensitive, and she always thinks of others in ways like giving them little presents. She's that type." ...|$|E

60|$|A <b>friend</b> <b>says,</b> {{that these}} boots are cast away by tramps.

But no nature-lover has ever observed the tramp or tramp family {{in the act of}} changing their clothes, and since there are even reasons to suppose that their garments are not detachable, it seems preferable to leave the wayside boot as a pleasant flavouring of mystery to our ramble. Another point, which also goes to explode this tramp theory, is that these countryside boots never occur in pairs, as any observer of natural history can testify....|$|E

60|$|My <b>friend</b> <b>says</b> the {{man must}} have fallen {{fighting}} here, {{as this is}} no place of burial. He turns again to the trench, scrapes, feels, till from a corner he draws out a heavy lump--a small image four or five inches high. We clean it as before. It is a statuette, apparently of gold, or, more probably, of bronze-gilt--a figure of Mercury, obviously, its head being surmounted with the petasus or winged hat, the usual accessory of that deity. Further inspection reveals the workmanship to be of good finish and detail, and, preserved by the limy earth, to be as fresh in every line as on the day it left the hands of its artificer.|$|E
60|$|This storm, {{like the}} first, {{is of the}} nature of a squall, and it ends as {{abruptly}} as the other. We dig no further.

But they fall to pieces under his touch: the air has disintegrated them, and he can only sweep in the fragments. The next act of his plan is more than difficult, but is carried out. The treasures are inhumed again in their respective holes: they are not ours. Each deposition seems to cost him a twinge; and at one moment I fancied I saw him slip his hand into his coat pocket.|$|E
