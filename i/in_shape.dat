5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and great passion since his playing career.

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} {{with a slight}} salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 {{micrometre}} (μm) which are joined by a well-developed network of mostly thin ridges.

5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal <b>in</b> <b>shape.</b> The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E

5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|The shrine was {{adorned with}} gold, silver and {{precious}} stones. In 1339, three London goldsmiths were employed {{for a whole}} year to rebuild the shrine to a higher standard.

5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish-brown. Spores range <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> from roughly rhomboid to roughly elliptical, and {{typically}} have dimensions of 5–6 by 4–6μm. They are thick-walled {{and have a}} large germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped to swollen, hyaline, usually four-spored (although rarely two- or three-spored forms are present), and measure 13–19 by 4.4–6.6μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are ventricose (swollen) near the base and often mucronate (ending abruptly in a short sharp point) at the apex, and measure 14–25 by 4.4–10.5μm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are variable <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> and measure 14–40 by 4.4–7.7μm. Pleurocystidia are relatively sparse, while cheilocystidia are abundant. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The application of a drop of potassium hydroxide solution turns both the cap and the stem from brown to blackish.|$|E
