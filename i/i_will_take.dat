5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

500|$|Following the war, {{he became}} Commanding General of the Marine Barracks at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. At Quantico, he {{transformed}} the wartime training camp into a permanent Marine post.

[...] Butler found the arm in a box. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one, and reburied the arm.

500|$|The mob of over 20,000 people {{developed}} into a riot. Windows and doors were smashed at the Forum and surrounding businesses. By the following morning, between 65 and 70 had been arrested. Over 50 stores were looted and 37 people injured. Damage was estimated at $100,000 ($ in [...] dollars). Richard had also attended the game, but left immediately following the forfeit. Frank Selke attempted {{to persuade him to}} return to try to disperse the crowd, but Richard refused, fearing that he would instead further inflame the passions of the mob. He took to the radio the next day asking for calm: [...] "Do no more harm. Get behind the team in the playoffs. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> my punishment and come back next year and help the club and the younger players to win the Cup." ...|$|E
500|$|Noreen's {{conviction}} led to divided {{opinions on}} the blasphemy laws and drew strong reactions from the public. Pakistani Human Rights Watch researcher Ali Dayan Hasan said, [...] "The law creates this legal infrastructure which is then used in various informal ways to intimidate, coerce, harass and persecute." [...] He further described the law as [...] "discriminatory and abusive". Governor Salmaan Taseer and Pakistan's Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti both publicly supported Noreen, with the latter saying, [...] "I will go to every knock for justice on her behalf and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> all steps for her protection." [...] She also received support from Pakistani political scientist Rasul Baksh Rais and local priest Samson Dilawar. The imprisonment of Noreen left Christians and other minorities in Pakistan feeling vulnerable, and liberal Muslims were also unnerved by her sentencing.|$|E
500|$|On 9 November 1889, a {{large number}} of {{officers}} gathered in the Military Club and decided to stage a coup d'état aimed at the overthrow of the monarchy. Two days later in the house of Rui Barbosa a plan to execute the coup was drawn up by officers who included Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, plus two civilians: Quintino Bocaiúva and Aristides Lobo. It was the only significant meeting in which civilian republicans participated, as Deodoro wished to exclude them from what he considered to be a strictly military matter. Deodoro still hesitated: [...] "I wanted to follow the Emperor's coffin, who is old and whom I deeply respect." [...] But he eventually yielded to pressure: [...] "He [...] wants it thus, let us make the Republic. Benjamin and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> care of the military action; Mr. Quintino and his friends will organize everything else." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm. Arnold then began asserting his {{authority}} over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Allen publicly {{announced that he was}} stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the Second Continental Congress was going to name [...] "a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|E
500|$|Jane Suuto was {{the joint}} oldest person to {{represent}} Uganda at the London Games {{at the age}} of 33. She had not entered any previous Summer Olympics. Sutto qualified for the Games because she achieved a third-place finish at the 2012 Riga Marathon with a time of two hours, 42 minutes and seven seconds, that met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's marathon. In an interview with New Vision before she competed Suuto said: [...] "I will not promise a medal but I will go out there to offer my best and whatever God offers me. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> it with both hands. I will go out there and fight." [...] In the event held on 5 August, she finished 93rd out of 107 athletes, with a time of two hours, 44 minutes and 46 seconds. Suuto ranked ahead of Yolimar Pineda of Venezuela (two hours, 45 minutes and 16 seconds) and Anikó Kálovics from Hungary (two hours, 45 minutes and 55 seconds) but was behind Kálovics's fellow countrywoman Zsófia Erdélyi (two hours, 44 minutes and 45 seconds). Suuto finished 21 minutes and 39 seconds behind event winner Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia (two hours, 23 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E
500|$|Saint Anselm College has {{resisted}} what the college {{sees as the}} grade inflation trend at many of America's college's and universities. At Saint Anselm, the top 25% of the class has a 3.1 GPA; the median grade at the college is around a 2.5 GPA. While the Dean's List at most schools begin at a 3.5 GPA, Saint Anselm awards students with the honor at a 3.0 GPA. According to a 2006 Fox News article, former Dean of the College Father Peter Guerin, O.S.B., {{is quoted as saying}} that today's [...] "parents may view universities as a consumer market in which they're in a way paying for the diploma.... Students who attend class on a regular basis and are paying tuition feel that they should be receiving that A, even if they have not deserved it." [...] Some professors and administrators believe that inflating grades makes it harder for students to realize their academic strengths and weaknesses and may encourage students to take classes based on grade expectations. The practice also makes it harder for parents and students {{to determine whether or not}} the grade was earned. A curriculum committee was set up in 1980 to meet with the academic dean and review the grading polices on a monthly basis. The previous president of the college, Father Jonathan DeFelice, is quoted as saying, [...] "I cannot speak for everyone, but if I'm headed for the operating room, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> the surgeon who earned his or her 'A' the honest way".|$|E

500|$|According {{to former}} {{president}} Victor Yushchenko the March 9, 2010 parliamentary amendment {{that made it}} possible for individual members of a parliamentary faction to join a coalition violated the Ukrainian Constitution, former Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko accused Yanukovych of [...] "trying to buy members of parliament for a new coalition" [...] (President Viktor Yanukovych accused Lutsenko of badly handling the affairs at the Ministry of Internal Affairs before appointing Anatolii Mohyliov to Lutsenko's old position.) and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc lawmaker Serhiy Mishchenko stated [...] "that the Verkhovna Rada had shown to the average citizen a bad example of how to violate the country’s laws and Constitution". Yushchenko did sent a letter to Yanukovych with a request to veto the law on March 10. Yanukovych signed the law nevertheless. 56 lawmakers filed a challenge to the law who made these amendments possible on March 11, 2010 at the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. On March 16, 2010 Minister of Justice Oleksandr Lavrynovych stated that even if the Constitutional Court rules the amendments unconstitutional the format of the Ukrainian parliamentary coalition will remain unchanged because [...] "the Constitutional Court's ruling becomes valid on the day of its announcement, not yesterday or the day before yesterday" [...] and the Constitutional Court's ruling will apply only to measures intended to establish a new coalition in Ukraine in the future. On March 26, 2010 President Yanukovych told a delegation from the European Parliament [...] "If the decision of the Constitutional Court will be that the coalition was formed illegally, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> a decision on a snap election, I will never go down the path of breaching the constitution that is in force". The Constitutional Court reviewing the case late March 2010. On urgent matters the court rules within weeks but on matters deemed less urgent it can take months or even longer. On March 29, 2010 former premier and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc leader Yulia Tymoshenko accused [...] "Representatives of Yanukovych" [...] of trying to bribe and blackmail Constitutional Court judges {{in order to get a}} ruling that legitimates the coalition and the government. This was denied by Yanukovych's Party of Regions.|$|E
