50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and ore bins erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another battery for crushing). They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The battery started crushing in February 1914 but broke down in May because the <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> broke. The company was doing very well through Morgan's careful management and William Keating's confidence. They were obtaining one ounce stone continually in 1914 and the battery kept going {{as long as there}} was water.|$|E

40|$|Wind turbine {{development}} has been formidable in the last years. One of NOWITECH's goals are to do research on large offshore wind turbines. A <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> and hub for the NOWITECH 10 MW reference turbine has been analyzed, according to IEC 61400. The work is based on Ebbe Smith's thesis about <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> design, and Mohammad Akram Khan's thesis about rotor shaft and rotor hub design. A completely new <b>bed</b> <b>plate</b> has been designed, and analyzed with more correct boundary conditions including a yaw bearing with contact surfaces and bolt connections between flanges. The hub received minor modifications, and is analyzed with a bolt connection and pitch bearings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the vibration characteristics and vibration control of complex ship structures. It is shown that input mobilities {{of a ship}} structure at engine supports, due to out-of-plane force or bending moment excitations, are governed by the flexural stiffness of the engine supports. The frequency averaged input mobilities of the ship structure, due to such excitations, can be represented by those of the corresponding infinite beam. The torsional moment input mobility at the engine support can be estimated from the torsional response of the <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> section under direct excitation. It is found that the inclusion of ship hull and deck plates in the ship structure model has {{little effect on the}} frequency-averaged response of the ship structure. This study also shows that vibration propagation in complex ship structures at low frequencies can be attenuated by imposing irregularities to the ring frame locations in ships. Vibration responses of ship structures due to machinery excitations at higher frequencies can be controlled by structural modifications of the local supporting structures such as <b>engine</b> <b>beds</b> in ships...|$|R
