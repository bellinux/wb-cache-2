25|$|Newman and Johnson {{sold the}} Norweb {{specimen}} to F.C.C. Boyd, who then resold {{it to the}} Numismatic Gallery (which handled several of the coins over the years). In 1949, it was purchased by King Farouk to replace the Olsen specimen, which he had sold. It remained in Farouk's collection until he was deposed by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952. Two years after that, Farouk's possessions were all auctioned off by the new regime. The Numismatic Gallery regained possession of it, and sold <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> to Ambassador Henry Norweb and his wife. The Norwebs donated the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Numismatic Collection in 1978 to commemorate their sixtieth wedding anniversary, where it remains.|$|E

In Michigan City, {{the track}} {{runs down the}} middle of 11th street from Michigan Boulevard to Tennessee Street, where it crosses over to Tenth Street, and has an at-grade diamond with Amtrak's Michigan Services. The track then runs down Tenth Street to Sheridan Avenue {{on the west side of}} Michigan City. Leaving Michigan City, the track travels through Indiana Dunes State Park, crosses over the Chicago Line and runs parallel to <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> on the south side, past Long Lake. At Gary, Indiana, the route heads west to service the Gary Airport, at times running parallel to the Indiana Toll Road, as far as Hammond, Indiana. Just west of the Hammond station, the route crosses into Illinois and Chicago city limits, at which point the track curves northwest, through the Hegewisch neighborhood and, after crossing the Bishop Ford Freeway and the Calumet River, converges with the Metra Electric line south of Kensington/115th Street station. The South Shore Line then runs over the Metra Electric from Kensington/115th Street the rest of the way to Millennium Station.|$|E

At the time of opening, the U-Drop was the only café within [...] of Shamrock, enjoying brisk business and becoming a successful establishment. Nunn sold the Inn after several years, but purchased it back in 1950 and renamed it Nunn's Café. In 1957, John Nunn died and his wife Bebe sold the café to Grace Brunner who again renamed <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> to Tower Café, and added a Greyhound bus station.|$|E

500|$|Ward Jackson {{continued}} to seek {{independence from the}} M and put forward a fresh proposal in 1859 to extend the line from Guisborough to the Tees at Cargo Fleet, so that the increasing demand for iron ore shipments to Tyneside could more easily be met. The S again opposed it. Although the House of Commons unanimously approved the Cleveland Extension Bill, it {{was rejected by the}} House of Lords. However, this left the door open for a private railway on the lands owned by Ward Jackson and his supporters. They began to construct it in 1860 {{under the auspices of the}} [...] "Upsall, Normanby and Ormesby Railway". Once again, the S opposed <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> on the grounds that the new line had to cross the S's Redcar branch line, but it eventually gave permission for the construction of a bridge to cross its line.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, on 29 January D Company, 7 RAR {{contacted}} {{a battalion}} concentrating in bunkers during a two and half hour battle that saw nine Australian casualties, including one killed, while seven Viet Cong were also killed. On 31 January Viet Cong overran {{the village of}} Trang Bom, just [...] south-west of FSB Andersen. The Australians reclaimed it that afternoon only for the communists to attack again the next day. Once again the Australians recaptured <b>it,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> in savage house-to-house fighting involving D Company, 2 RAR/NZ and A Squadron, 3 CAV. C Company, 3 RAR was subsequently inserted {{to assist with the}} protection of FSB Harrison. In response to the attack on Trang Bom, D Company, 7 RAR was dispatched forward to search the area. The lead platoon advanced on a Viet Cong camp—later found to be battalion-size—and was almost destroyed in the ensuing fire-fight. With half the platoon soon becoming casualties, another platoon was moved forward to aid their extraction. Close support from artillery protected the Australians from further casualties however, and the Viet Cong was eventually forced to withdraw. Six Australians had been killed and 36 wounded in the engagements up to that point, while one New Zealander had also died and one wounded. More than 40 Viet Cong had been killed and nine wounded.|$|E

Its results were dire for the Germans; [...] "12 May 1944, can fairly be described as the worst single day of the war for Germany.

Albert Speer wrote, [...] "The enemy has struck us at one of our weakest points.

But we will seriously consider <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> as {{it will be very difficult}} to get all the guys of the band together to go on tour.

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics.

[...] James Hunter of Rolling Stone similarly praised the album for its [...] "finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars" [...] and concluded that the album was a rarity in the way it [...] "works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material." [...] Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.|$|E

2500|$|One of Tanaka's most remembered {{achievements}} is normalizing Japanese {{relations with}} the People's Republic of China, which occurred {{around the same time}} as Richard Nixon's efforts {{to do the same for}} Chinese {{relations with the}} United States. In 1972, Tanaka met with Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to discuss the normalization of relations between the two countries. Among other matters, they discussed the Senkaku Islands, which would later become a major point of contention between the two countries. Tanaka reportedly asked Zhou [...] "What is your view on the Senkaku Islands? Some people say things about them to me," [...] to which Zhou replied [...] "I do not want to talk about <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> If there wasn't oil, neither Taiwan nor the United States would make this an issue." [...] Just two months after taking office, Tanaka met Mao Zedong.|$|E
2500|$|In 1862, a new Bill was deposited, {{seeking to}} extend the Upper Corris Tramway to iron ore mines at Tir Stent, near Cross Foxes. The bill also sought powers to raise further capital for the {{tramroad}} and allow the use of locomotives. But {{the directors of the}} Aberystwyth & Welsh Coast Railway (A) objected and the Bill failed. Another similar Bill was deposited in December 1863, and again the A opposed <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> <b>time,</b> however, they withdrew their objection; the CM company had been acquired by Thomas Savin, who was the principle contractor {{in the construction of the}} tramroad, and Savin had offered to sell the company to the A [...] The second Bill passed on 25 July 1864; it formally converted the tramroad to a railway changing the company's name to the Corris Railway Company, allowed the use of steam locomotives and allowed the abandonment of the section west of Machynlleth.|$|E
2500|$|Both Zu and Lady Lu then {{reported}} the song to Gao Wei to further foster his suspicion of Hulü. [...] Gao Wei consulted another favorite, Han Zhangluan, {{who believed that}} he should not suspect Hulü, so Gao Wei initially took no action. [...] Zu, however, would not relent, and he had Hulü's subordinate Feng Shirang (封士讓) make a secret submission indicating that when Hulü had brought the army close to Yecheng in 571, he was plotting a coup. [...] Gao Wei believed <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> and under Zu's suggestion, he awarded Hulü a horse, and then, as Hulü arrived at the palace to thank the emperor, he had his guard commander Liu Taozhi (劉桃枝) seize Hulü and strangle him to death. [...] Hulü's clan was slaughtered except for his youngest son Hulü Zhong (斛律鍾), and Empress Hulü was deposed. [...] Subsequently, Lady Lu tried to have her adoptive daughter Consort Mu Sheli made empress, but was forced to compromise with Empress Dowager Hu to have Empress Dowager Hu's niece Consort Hu made empress, a proposal that she had to formally make jointly with Zu.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, Llewelyn-Bowen and {{his wife}} Jackie were offered {{a place on the}} Valentine's Day celebrity couples edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? They {{appeared}} on the show managing to reach the £1 million question, before answering it incorrectly and dropping down to £32,000 (a loss of £468,000). For the first time ever, Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen {{and his wife}} retry the show after the company claimed that the last question [...] "didn't meet their standards". After returning and being shown a different £1 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing £468,000 for the second time and won £500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Children's Hospice, of which Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife are both patrons. Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom. They decided not to risk <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> and walked away with the £500,000. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? The £468,000 they originally lost was also the greatest loss ever seen on the show, and no other contestant has ever answered the final question incorrectly in the United Kingdom version. The allegedly misleading question was [...] "Translated from the Latin, what is the United States motto?" [...] The answer given was [...] "In God We Trust" [...] which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been [...] "One Out of Many" [...] which is a translation of the Latin phrase E pluribus unum, which is not actually the current United States motto. E pluribus unum had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such.|$|E
2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> <b>time</b> around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
