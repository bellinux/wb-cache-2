40|$|Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) {{is a very}} {{infrequent}} {{disorder that}} causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. The main clinical features of IHP at presentation include headache, cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and seizures. Intracranial hypotension (ICH) and distension of anterior internal vertebral venous plexus (IVVP) have not previously been reported as the main clinical manifestations. We report a unique case with these characteristics as the main clinical findings, and investigate the internal rela tionship between these characteristics. This study highlights the heterogeneity of IHP, in terms of clinical, imaging, and pathological features.

40|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} diseases worldwide. Although estimated that one third of the world's population are infected with Toxoplasma gondii, but the most common form of the disease is latent (asymptomatic). On the other hand, recent findings indicated that la-tent toxoplasmosis is not only unsafe for human, but also may play various roles in the etiology of different mental disorders. This paper reviews new findings about importance of latent toxop-lasmosis (except in immunocompromised patients) in alterations of behavioral parameters and also its role in the etiology of schizophrenia and depressive disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's diseases and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> <b>or</b> migraine, men-tal retardation and intelligence quotients, suicide attempt, risk of traffic accidents, sex ratio and some possible mechanisms of T. gondii that could contribute in the etiology of these alterations...|$|R
5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> nausea <b>or</b> vomiting may also occur.

50|$|Urticaria pigmentosa is {{characterized}} by excessive amounts of mast cells in the skin. Red or brown spots are often seen on the skin, typically around the chest and forehead. These mast cells, when irritated (e.g. by rubbing the skin, heat exposure), produce too much histamine, triggering an allergic reaction that leads to hives localized {{to the area of}} irritation, sometimes referred to as Darier's sign. Severe itching usually follows, and scratching the area only serves to further symptoms. Symptoms can be mild (flushing and hives that require no treatment), moderate (diarrhea, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> fainting), <b>or</b> life-threatening (vascular collapse requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization).|$|R
50|$|Central {{nervous system}} side effects are quite {{frequently}} noted and encompass speech and visual disturbances, mental depression <b>and</b> confusion, hallucinations, <b>headache,</b> insomnia <b>and</b> exacerbation <b>or</b> precipitation of seizures, and increased nervousness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the distribution of the polymorphisms of the SCN 1 A gene in a series of children and adolescents with primary <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> idiopathic <b>or</b> cryptogenic epilepsy compared to controls. Five non-synonymous exonic polymorphisms (1748 A > T, 2656 T > C, 3199 A > G, 5771 G > A, 5864 T > C) of the SCN 1 A gene were selected and their genotyping was performed, by high resolution melting (HRM), in 49 cases and 100 controls. We found that among the five polymorphisms, only 3199 A > G was a true polymorphism. We did not find a statistically significant difference between distribution of 3199 A > G genotypes between cases and controls. We excluded the role of the SCN 1 A gene in the pathogenesis of comorbidity between <b>headache</b> (especially migraine) <b>and</b> epilepsy. The SCN 1 A gene is a major gene in different epilepsies and epilepsy syndromes; the HRM could be the new methodology, more rapid and efficacious, for molecular analysis of the SCN 1 A gene...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the {{comorbidity}} between <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> epilepsy in a large series of children with headache (1, 795). Fifty-six cases (3. 1 %) suffered from idiopathic <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> idiopathic <b>or</b> cryptogenic epilepsy or unprovoked seizures. There was a strong association between migraine and epilepsy: in mi-graineurs (46 / 56) the risk of epilepsy was 3. 2 times higher when compared with tension-type headache, without sig-nificant difference between migraine with and without aura (P = 0. 89); children with epilepsy had a 4. 5 -fold increased risk of developing migraine than tension-type headache. In cases with comorbidity, focal epilepsies prevailed (43 / 56, 76. 8 %). Migraineurs affected by focal epilepsies (36 / 56) had a three times higher risk of having a cryptogenic epi-lepsy (27 / 36, 75 %) than an idiopathic epilepsy (9 / 36, 25 %) (P = 0. 003). In migraine with aura, epilepsy preceded migraine in 71 % of cases. Photosensitivity (7 / 56, 12. 5 %) and positive family history for epilepsy (22 / 56, 39 %) were frequent in cases with comorbidity...|$|R
40|$|A self-administerd {{questionnaire}} was posted to 1 129 medical general practitioners {{in an urban}} and {{in a rural area}} of England. The prevalences of <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> of the features of migraine, in the year immediately preceding the survey were similar in the two areas. After allowing for the different age and sex composition of the populations, these prevalences were also similar to those found in the general population during an early survey in Wales. About 13 % of the male and 25 % of the female general practitioners thought that they had had migraine in the previous year. There was little evidence that doctors with 'classic' migraine differed from those with 'common' migraine in the proportion who experienced other migrainous features (unilateral distribution of <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> accompanying nausea) <b>or</b> in their response to treatment with ergotamine...|$|R
30|$|After {{collinearity}} diagnostics {{had been}} performed to exclude high correlation between different variables within the model, direct logistic regression {{was performed to}} assess the impact of a number of factors on the likelihood that trainees would report that they had experienced problems with pain <b>or</b> <b>eyestrain</b> following laparoscopic surgery.

40|$|Headache is {{the most}} {{frequent}} neurological symptom and the most prevalent pain in children and adolescents, and constitutes a serious health problem {{that may lead to}} impairment in several areas. Psychosocial factors, social environment, life events, school and family stressors are all closely related to headaches. A multidisciplinary strategy is fundamental in addressing <b>headache</b> in children <b>and</b> adolescents. Applying such a strategy can lead to reductions in frequency and severity of the pain, improving significantly {{the quality of life of}} these children. It has been demonstrated that behavioral intervention is highly effective, especially in the treatment of paediatric <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> can enhance <b>or</b> replace pharmacotherapy, with the advantage of eliminating dangerous side effects <b>and</b> <b>or</b> reducing costs. Behavioral interventions appear to maximize long-term therapeutic benefits and improve compliance with pharmacological treatment, which has proven a significant problem with child <b>and</b> adolescent with <b>headache.</b> The goal of this review is to examine the existing literature on behavioral therapies used to treat <b>headache</b> in children <b>and</b> adolescents, and so provide an up-to-date picture of what behavioral therapy is and what its effectiveness is...|$|R
40|$|Background A strong {{relationship}} between insomnia and painful disorders has been found, {{but it is still}} unclear whether chronic pain leads to insomnia. There is a need of large-scale prospective studies to evaluate if there is a causal relationship between painful disorders and insomnia. Methods All inhabitants aged ≥ 20 years in Nord-Trøndelag County of Norway were invited to participate in two surveys (n = 92, 566 and 93, 860, respectively). 27, 185 subjects participated in both surveys, and 19, 271 of these were insomnia-free at baseline (population at risk). Using logistic regression, we evaluated the influence of <b>headache,</b> CMSCs <b>and</b> coexisting <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> CMSCs on the subsequent risk of insomnia. Results Compared to subjects without <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> CMSCs, there was an increased risk of insomnia among those with headache, most pronounced among those with headache ≥ 7 days / month (OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 9 – 2. 6). Similarly, an increased risk among those with CMSCs was found, most evident for those with widespread CMSCs (OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 8 – 2. 2). Having coexistent CMSCs <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> (<b>OR</b> = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 8 – 2. 2) predisposed more strongly to insomnia than having headache (OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 3 – 1. 6) <b>and</b> CMSCs (<b>OR</b> = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 4 – 1. 7) alone.
