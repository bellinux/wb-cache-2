40|$|The {{study of}} the {{collective}} behavior {{of a large number}} of interacting agents, often called a “crowd”, has drawn a growing attention from several scientific communities. This research topic has an impact on civil engineering (problems of emergency egress and road traffic), robotics (coordination of robots and networked control), computer science and sociology (social networks), and biology (groups, herds and flocks). Some major difficulties are deeply related to the use of such models. First of all, from the theoretical viewpoint, standard analytical tools are not very useful in this context, since the presence {{of a large number of}} agents corresponds to a state space of big dimension. Moreover, for human and animal crowds, the dynamics of each agent is not clearly identified, since it is highly sensitive to internal and external perturbations (such as stress, panic and presence of obstacles). For these reason, stimulated by the numerous theoretical and applied challenges, a large number of researcher currently works on crowd models. The first question to address, in this context, is the choice of a mathematical framework for the description of the dynamics of agents. The crowd can be described with three frameworks: microscopic, macroscopic or multi-scale. In the microscopic approach, the crowd is represented by the position of each agent, and its dynamics is a system of ordinary differential equations of very big dimension. In the macroscopic approach, the crowd is given by the density of agents, and its dynamics is a partial differential equation (PDE in the following), often of transport type. In the multi-scale approach, also called “granular”, the population is composed both of a microscopic part of “remarkable” agents (such as leaders), and of a macroscopic part for the rest of the crowd. In this third framework, in which I develop most of my researches, measures are the main tool. In Section 1, I present my results of analysis in this context. I focus on a particular class of PDEs for dynamics of measures. This class of transport equations with non-local velocities is at the core of models for crowds. Indeed, each agent in a crowd interacts with its neighbors, generating a dynamics depending not only on its position (local term), but also on positions of others (non-local term). In Section 1. 1, I describe a rigorous and mathematically rich framework in which transport equations with non-local velocities enjoy good properties: existence and uniqueness of solutions, continuous dependance, etc. I then study some numerical schemes for such equations, described in Section 1. 2, for which I also prove convergence. After this, I define in Section 1. 3 a generalization of the Wasserstein distance to mass-varying measures. For this distance, I prove interesting properties related to the transport PDE with source, and in particular a generalization of the Benamou-Brenier formula. I finally present in Section 1. 4 some specific results for the transport equation in a non-smooth setting, useful for models of road traffic. Beside the problem of analyzing the collective behavior of crowds, it is interesting to understand what behavior changes can be induced on them by an external agent – e. g. a policy maker or some leaders. The research mainstream for such problems has been focused on creating efficient facilities or rules, with a static point of view. Recently, such setting has been challenged by a more dynamic and time-dependent point of view. This implies a change of approach: we pass from a static optimization problem to a control problem, depending on time and on configurations. For example, if we consider emergency egress problems, with a statical point of view the infrastructure is designed with a given configuration and it cannot be modified. With the new, dynamical point of view, one can introduce light signals or portable devices to drive the crowd to the best direction. This innovative approach leads to the problem of control of crowds: one wants to understand what changes of behavior can be induced to the crowd by some leaders or by an external policy maker. Such problems have already been studied in control theory for coordination of agents of very different natures, such as flying drones formations, routing in telecommunication networks, smart grids and power network control. In this general framework, I worked on the control of the transport equation with non-local velocities. My results are presented in Section 2. I first discuss in Section 2. 1 a theoretical problem for crowd control. When one passes from a microscopic to a macroscopic model, the indistinguishability of agents is a necessary requirement: this is in sharp contrast with the fact that controls are applied to specific agents. For this reason, I present two specific control problems. In Section 2. 2, I describe the control the kinetic Cucker-Smale problem to a flocking configuration. This is one of the few known results of control of the transport equation with non-local velocity, and the only one with localized control. Section 2. 3 is focused on an optimal control problem for a system coupling a controlled dynamical system for leaders and a transport PDE for the rest of the crowd. The main result is a generalization of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to this measure setting, in which the Hamiltonian equation is written in terms of a Wasserstein gradient. This thesis also contains some other research results in control and system theory, as well as analysis of PDEs. They are shortly described in Section 3. These results are quite independent with respect to topics in previous sections. Nevertheless, research tools used in the three sections are common, being based on geometric control. Moreover, I focus on PDE models, and in particular on limits permitting to pass from a finite-dimensional system to the associated PDE. See some examples in Sections 1. 1, 2, 3. 1 and 3. 2. Finally, a Curriculum Vitae is presented in Section 4. L’étude du comportement collectif d’un grand nombre d’agents en interaction, souvent dénommé “foule”, a suscité un grand intérêt de la part des communautés scientifiques. Ce sujet de recherche touche aussi bien le Génie civil (évacuation de bâtiments et problèmes du trafic routier), la Robotique (coordination de robots volants), l’Informatique et la Sociologie (réseaux sociaux), que la Biologie (groupes, troupeaux et vols d’oiseaux). Des difficultés majeures sont intimement liées à l’utilisation de ces modèles. En effet, d’un point de vue théorique, la présence d’un grand nombre d’agents rend les outils classiques de l’analyse mathématique peu utiles, car l’espace d’état est de très grande dimension. De plus, pour les foules humaines ou d’animaux, la dynamique de chaque agent n’est pas clairement identifiée, car elle est très sensible aux facteurs intérieurs et extérieurs (comme le stress, la panique, la présence d’obstacles). C’est pour cela que, stimulés par les multiples défis théoriques et applicatifs, de nombreux chercheurs travaillent sur les modèles de foules. La première question qu’il est nécessaire de se poser, en ce contexte, concerne le choix d’un cadre mathématique pour la description de la dynamique des agents. La population peut se décrire de trois façons : microscopique, macroscopique ou multiéchelle. Dans l’approche microscopique, la foule est représentée par la position de chaque agent, et sa dynamique est un système d’équations aux dérivées ordinaires de dimension très grande. Dans l’approche macroscopique, la foule est donnée par la densité d’agents, et sa dynamique est une équation aux dérivées partielles (EDP dans la suite), souvent de type transport. Dans l’approche “multi-échelle”, dite aussi “granulaire”, la population se compose tout autant d’une partie microscopique d’agents “significatifs” (tels que les leaders) que d’une partie macroscopique pour le reste de la foule. Dans cette troisième approche, dans laquelle je développe la plupart de mes recherches, les mesures sont l’outil principal utilisé. La Section 1 présente mes résultats d’analyse dans ce contexte. Je m’intéresse à une classe particulière d’EDP pour la dynamique des mesures. Cette classe d’équations de transport avec vitesses non-locales est au coeur des modèles pour les foules. En effet, chaque agent dans une foule est en interaction avec ses voisins, engendrant ainsi une dynamique qui ne dépend pas seulement de sa position (terme locale), mais aussi des positions des autres (terme non-local). <b>En</b> <b>Section</b> 1. 1, j’expose d’abord un cadre assez rigoureux et riche dans lequel les équations de transport avec vitesses non-locales ont de bonnes propriétés : existence et unicité de la solution, dépendance continue, etc. Puis, j’étudie certains schémas numériques pour ces équations, décrits <b>en</b> <b>Section</b> 1. 2, et je démontre leur convergence. Je définis ensuite <b>en</b> <b>Section</b> 1. 3 une généralisation de la distance de Wasserstein aux mesures de masse variable. Pour cette distance, je prouve des propriétés intéressantes en lien avec l’EDP de transport avec source, et notamment une généralisation de la formule de Benamou-Brenier. Enfin, je présente <b>en</b> <b>Section</b> 1. 4 certains résultats spécifiques pour l’équation de transport dans un cadre non-lisse, qui est utilisée dans des modèles de trafic routier. Au-delà de la description et de l’analyse du comportement collectif, il est intéressant de se demander quels changements un agent extérieur – un gouvernement régulateur ou des leaders, par exemple – peut induire sur une foule. La plupart des recherches dans ce domaine ont été consacrées à la création de structures ou de règles efficientes, avec un point de vue statique. Aujourd’hui cependant, ce point de vue est remis en question par une vision dynamique et variable dans le temps. On assiste à un changement de paradigme : d’un problème d’optimisation statique on passe à un problème de commande, dépendant du temps et des configurations. Si l’on considère les problèmes d’évacuation, par exemple, avec un point de vue statique, l’infrastructure est conçue dans une configuration donnée et elle ne peut subir aucune modification. Avec le nouveau paradigme dynamique, quand une sortie de secours est congestionnée, on peut introduire des signaux lumineux ou des dispositifs portables pour envoyer la foule vers la direction la plus convenable. Cette approche introduit le problème de la commande des foules : on souhaite comprendre quels changements de comportement peuvent être produits sur la foule par des leaders ou par un régulateur extérieur. Ces problèmes ont déjà été étudiés en automatique pour la coordination d’agents dans des situations très variées, comme les formations de drones en vol, le routing dans les réseaux de télécommunication, les problèmes d’énergie avec les “smart grids”. Dans ce cadre très général, j’ai travaillé à la commande de l’équation de transport avec vitesse non-locale. La Section 2 en présente les résultats. Je discute d’abord <b>en</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 1 d’un problème conceptuel pour la commande des foules. Pour passer d’un modèle microscopique à un modèle macroscopique, l’indistinguabilité des agents est nécessaire : cette propriété s’oppose au fait que les commandes agissent normalement sur des agents précis. Pour cette raison, je présente des problèmes de commande dans deux cas particuliers. <b>En</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 2, je montre la commande du modèle de champ moyen de Cucker et Smale vers une configuration d’alignement. C’est l’un des rares résultats en littérature de commande de l’équation de transport avec vitesse non-locale, et le seul avec commande localisée. <b>En</b> <b>Section</b> 2. 3, j’étudie un problème de commande optimale où la dynamique est donnée par le couplage d’un système contrôlé pour des leaders avec une EDP de transport pour le reste de la foule. Le résultat principal est la généralisation du Principe de Maximum de Pontryaguine à ce problème de mesures, dans lequel l’équation de Hamilton est écrite comme un gradient de Wasserstein. Ce mémoire contient aussi plusieurs autres résultats de recherche dans le domaine de l’automatique, de la commande et de l’analyse des EDP. La Section 3 les décrit plus brièvement. Ces résultats sont assez indépendants par rapport aux sujets présentés dans les sections précédentes. Il est à noter, cependant, que les instruments de recherche utilisés dans les trois sections relèvent tous de la commande géométrique. Je focalise également mon attention sur les modèles d’EDP, et en particulier sur les méthodes de limite permettant de passer d’un système en dimension finie à une EDP associée.

Citizen Rights and the Cost of Law Enforcement by Melvin Reder There is an inherent tension between the idea that individuals have certain inalienable (natural) rights and the economist's postulate that the rate of utilization of anything whose production requires scarce resources must be limited by considerations of opportunity cost. Remarks about rights to life, liberty, health, justice and the like are readily inserted into political pronouncements, legislative preambles and court decisions, but they (should) cause economists to raise questions about costs and quantities. Unfortunately, neither in ordinary language nor in the jargon of moral philosophy can such ultimate desiderata as liberty and justice be related to costs or quantities. Hence in the first section we sketch a model of social choice in which the necessary relationships can be defined. <b>En</b> <b>section</b> II, we give instances where, despite protestations to the contrary, the Law Enforcement System (LES) has made de facto reductions of citizen rights (liberties) in order to increase the efficiency of law enforcement.

40|$|During the Mid-Cretaceous thin siliciclastic and {{carbonate}} sediments rich in glauconite and phosphorites weredeposited on the Southern part ot the Helvetic Shelf. These deposits overlie the shallow-water UrgonianLimestones, {{and they}} are covered by pelagic biomicrites of the Seewen Limestones. New stratigraphic units are proposed for these Mid-Cretaceous deposits:- the Aravis Formation composed of two members, the Bossetan Member (0 - 40 m, Upper Aptian) and the PlatéMember (0, 1 - 20 m, Late Aptian to Mid-Upper Cenomanian). These are separated by the important late-Aptianunconformity,- the Freu Beds (0 - 6 m, late Albian to early Coniacian), with facies of the Aravis Fm reworked in an Albian toearly Coniacian micritic matrice. The palaeontology of the ichnofauna and the microbial encrustations are given close attention. The verticalsequence of taphocenoses indicates a deepening trend from Aptian to Turonian. The study of the Albian-Cenomanian deposits gives evidence of sedimentary areas partially characterized byerosionat unconformities. As the fauna indicates a marine environment and no signs of emersion were detected,the erosional surfaces are probably a consequence of a submarine erosion. These discontinuities lie closer whengoing from N-E to S-W, i. e. from distal to proximal part of the shelf. This shinkage is strongest in the Easternpart of the Bauges massif where {{the top of the}} Urgonian limestones contains solution cavities measuring severalmeters. A synthetis of the data provides an account of the sedimentary evolution of the Southern Helvetic shelf. Thisevolution began in the early Upper Aptian by the drowning of the Urgonian platform. A mineralised hard-groundbearing phosphatized lag-deposits and ammonites veneers the rudistid-miliolid limeatones. During the Upper Aptian, sandy biocalcarenites containing small phosphoclasts (Aujon beds) were depositedin the restricted area of the "Platé-Dents du Midi". Then, after a period of fine-grained siliciclastic deposition(Borderan Beds), mixed-sedimentation with bio- and siliciclastic components took place (Colombière Beds). Fauna composition and depositional features indicate a storm-influenced environment below faire-weather wavebase. This sedimentation was interrupted by the late-Aptian unconformity (L. A. unconformity), an irregularsurface showing plurikilometer scours cut into the Upper Aptian deposits. From late Upper Aptian to late Upper Albian, phosphate-rich greensands, containing fossiliferous condensedhorizons (Lindars Sandstones) were deposited. The main internal unconformities identify two depositional unitswithin the Lindars Sandstones. In the first, late Aptian to Middle Albian, the sediments show numerous lateralfacies and thickness changes. Some of these changes are partly controlled by the irregular shape of the L. A. unconformity: phosphate-rich condensed deposits with microbial encrustations were deposited on the high parts,while siliciclastic-rich deposits, five to ten times thicker than the phosphate-rich deposits, were accumulatedwithin the erosional scours. The second unit of the Lindars Sandstones is separated from the first one by the Upper Albian unconformitywhich is commonly cut into by the deep Late Upper Albian unconformity. So the Upper Albian deposits aregenerally very condensed and represented only by polyzonal phosphatic conglomerates in which Lower andMiddle Albian faunas may be reworked. During the Lower to Mid-Cenomanian, an hemipelagic carbonate sedimentation with low sedimentation rate(i. e. < 20 cm/year) was established. The deposits are represented by thin glauconitic biomicrites containingphosphatic nodules and mini-stromatolites. These deposits cover or rework the Albian phosphaticconglomerates. Despite the disappearance of the glauconite and the phosphorites during the Mid-Cenomanian,the very low sedimentation rates persisted until the Turonian whereas pelagic biomicrites were deposited. Confrontation of the sedimentary data with the structural data provides a palaeogeographical framework forthe Southern Helvetic Shelf. Two kinds of shelf edge are suggested: the first is represented by a sedimentaryprism prograding to the Ultrahelvetic Basin, the second by a structural shoal probably inherited from the Jurassicperiod of rifting. The genesis of the condensed deposits is approached in the conclusion. The good correlation existingbetween the main unconformities detected in this work and the main sea-level falls of HAQ et al. (1987) suggests an eustatic control of the sedimentary sequences. But this control is not by itself sufficient and it cannotexplain the low sedimentation rates during Albian and Cenomanian as well as the juxtaposition ofcontemporaneous accumulation areas and strong condensation areas. Taking account of the oceanic circulation in the western Tethys, a complementary sedimentary control withsubsurface currents is proposed. These currents could also explain the large erosional scours associated to themain unconformities. Therefore the long axis of these erosional figures more or less parallel to the shelf edgecould indicate the direction of current flow which appears locally influenced by the structural shoals. Finally, during the Mid Cretaceous, the important distribution of condensed deposits on the European andApulian Margins gives a reconstruction of the oceanic subsurface circulation in the Western Tethys flowingfrom the Western Carpathian domain to the Betic Cordillère.

Ces dépôts riches en horizons fossilifères organisés en conglomérats phosphatés polyzonaux s'intercalent entre les calcaires urgoniens à rudistes et les calcaires à plancton de Seewen.

40|$|Background: The senior {{consultants}} Ross Benger and Andrew Gal {{have been}} using <b>en</b> face frozen <b>section</b> histological margin control in removing cancer from the periocular region since 1985. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the percentage of cases in which more than one resection was necessary in order to achieve clear margins. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients treated at Drummoyne Eye Surgical Centre in the period 1999 - 2007, in whom removal of the eyelid cancer was decided to be with <b>en</b> face frozen <b>section</b> histological control. A record was kept of how many resections were necessary to achieve clear margins. Paraffin sections were subsequently examined for a final histopathological diagnosis. Results: Two hundred and fifty people were included in the study, of whom 204 had basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 32 had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). One hundred and twenty BCCs had a full-thickness eyelid "wedge" resection, of which 45 % needed more than the standard two frozen sections taken to achieve clear margins. Eighty-four BCCs were removed using ring resection, of which 35. 7 % needed more than the standard initial resections (peripheral annulus and deep disc) to achieve clear margins. Conclusions: Our study showed that a significant percentage of BCC and SCC lesions needed further resection after the initial frozen section edge checks to achieve clear margins. Intraoperative presence of the histopathologist increased the likelihood of achieving clearance of the cancer at a single operating session. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|What {{appear to}} be true septate {{junctions}} by all techniques currently available for the cytological identification of intercellular junctions {{are part of a}} complex junction that interconnects the Sertoli cells of the canine testis. In the seminiferous epithelium, septate junctions are located basal to belts of tight junctions. In thin sections, septate junctions appear as double, parallel, transverse connections or septa spanning an- 90 -A intercellular space between adjacent Sertoli cells. In <b>en.</b> face <b>sections</b> of lanthanum-aldehyde-peffused specimens, the septa themselves exclude lanthanum and appear as electron-lucent lines arranged in a series of double, parallel rows on a background of electron-dense lanthanum. In freezefracture replicas this vertebrate septate junction appears as double, parallel rows of individual or fused particles which conform to the distribution of the intercellular septa. Septate junctions can be clearly distinguished from tight junctions as tight junctions prevent the movement of lanthanum tracer toward the lumen, appear as single rows of individual or fused particles in interlacing patterns within freeze-fracture replicas, and are seen as areas of close membrane apposition i...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the expression and cellular {{distribution of the}} tight junction-related proteins occludin, claudin and ZO- 1 in human corneal epithelium. Methods. Light and electron immunohistochemistry {{was used to determine}} tissue distribution of occludin, claudin- 1 and ZO- 1 in the human corneal epithelium. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to reveal claudin mRNA expression in human corneal epithelium. Results. In transverse sections, occludin and ZO- 1 were localized at the apical cell–cell junctions between superficial cells in stratified corneal epithelium. Both basal and basolateral membranes of superficial cells were stained by the claudin- 1 antibody, but no apical membrane staining was observed. In <b>en</b> face <b>sections,</b> claudin- 1 and ZO- 1 antibodies showed as bands that corresponded to the junctional complex. Claudin- 1 staining of superficial cell cytoplasm was also observed. Occludin staining was seen at the junctional complex, where it was not continuous, but dotted along the cell junctions. The transcripts for claudin- 1 and several other claudin isotypes, such as - 2, - 3, - 4, - 7, - 9 and - 14 were identified. Conclusion. Not only occludin, but also some claudins act as integral transmembrane proteins in the corneal epithelium.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} are now routinely described between {{many kinds}} of cells and are thought to mediate electrotonic coupling by providing patent communicating channels between cells through which ions and other metabolites can pass (3, 17). The gap junction has an intercellular space of 20 - 40. ~ as delineated by en bloc uranyl acetate staining and colloidal lanthanum tracing techniques in sectioned tissue (16). The substructure as seen by lanthanum tracing in <b>en</b> face <b>sections</b> through gap junctions (16) {{as well as by}} negative staining (2) is typically described as an hexagonal array of subunits having a diameter of about 80,~, and a center-to-center spacing of 90 - 100 /~.

The major differences noted are the varying sizes of subunit particles, their density per unit area, and their arrangement. Such atypical gap junction substructures have been noted by examination of freezefracture preparations in vertebrates (1, 4, 6, 13, 15, 18) and invertebrates (11, 17). Study of lanthanum-treated tissue has in one case suggested two packing arrangements of subunits (10) and in another case suggested an unusual configuration of subunits which are more clearly defined in freezefracture preparations (1).

6000|$|Having {{shown that}} M. Comte's alleged law of {{progression}} {{does not hold}} among the several parts of the same science, let us see how it agrees with the facts when applied to separate sciences. [...] "Astronomy," [...] says M. Comte, {{at the opening of}} Book III., [...] "was a positive science, in its geometrical aspect, from the earliest days of the school of Alexandria; but Physics, which we are now to consider, had no positive character at all till Galileo made his great discoveries on the fall of heavy bodies." [...] On this, our comment is simply that it is a misrepresentation based upon an arbitrary misuse of words--a mere verbal artifice. By choosing to exclude from terrestrial physics those laws of magnitude, motion, and position, which he includes in celestial physics, M. Comte makes it appear that the one owes nothing to the other. Not only is this altogether unwarrantable, but it is radically inconsistent with his own scheme of divisions. At the outset he says--and as the point is important we quote from the original--"Pour la physique inorganique nous voyons d'abord, en nous conformant toujours a l'ordre de généralité et de dépendance des phénomènes, qu'elle doit être partagée <b>en</b> deux <b>sections</b> distinctes, suivant qu'elle considère les phénomènes généraux de l'univers, ou, en particulier, ceux que présentent les corps terrestres.
