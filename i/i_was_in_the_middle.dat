500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about {{because a lot of people}} don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

Beyond the path was a croquet lawn, and on this lawn I perceived, as through a glass darkly, three figures. The mist cleared from my eyes, and I recognised two of them.|$|E

60|$|I dreamed, I thought, {{that once}} {{while he was}} blowing into this dismal flute, the old woman of the house, who had gone nearer and nearer to him in her ecstatic admiration, leaned {{over the back of}} his chair and gave him an affectionate squeeze round the neck, which stopped his playing for a moment. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> state between {{sleeping}} and waking, either then or immediately afterwards; for, as he resumed--it was a real fact that he had stopped playing--I saw and heard the same old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to which Mrs. Fibbitson replied, 'Ay, ay! yes!' and nodded at the fire: to which, I am persuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.|$|E

Luckily I was stopped by a piece of machinery, consisting of a heap of green blankets and a young lady coming up as Venus rising from the sea. If I had not fallen so soft, I don't know {{what might have been}} the consequence of the collusion. I never told Mrs. Coxe, for she can't bear to hear of my paying the least attention to the fair sex.|$|E
6000|$|... "Inspiration {{has made}} the difference," [...] said Mr. Barbecue-Smith solemnly. [...] "It came quite suddenly--like a gentle dew from heaven." [...] He lifted his hand and let it fall back on to his knee to {{indicate}} the descent of the dew. [...] "It was one evening. I was writing my first little book about the Conduct of Life--'Humble Heroisms'. You may have read it; {{it has been a}} comfort--at least I hope and think so--a comfort to many thousands. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the second chapter, and I was stuck.

I sat biting the end of my pen and looking at the electric light, which hung above my table, a little above and in front of me." [...] He indicated the position of the lamp with elaborate care.

6000|$|Such endearing tenderness, graced {{with the}} most {{innocent}} and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly into my right understanding; and when I considered all the transactions of my life, and particularly my new engagement, that I had now one child already born, and my wife big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek for more riches, who already was blessed with sufficiency, with much struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving to apply myself to some business or other, which might put a period to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution to move thither; upon this there was a pretty convenient house surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, which suited my temper, as to planting, managing, and cultivating. Nor was I long before I entered upon my new settlement, having bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons, horses, cows, and sheep; so that I now led {{the life of a}} country gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as the greatest monarch in the world. And what made me think my happiness the greater was, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> state of life, which my father had so often recommended, much resembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly described by the poet in these lines: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{story is}} true {{as far as}} it goes, Tom. I did catch one of them a back- handed blow just under his helmet as he ran past me, and I doubt not that it {{finished}} him; as to the other, I laid his cheek open. It was a hot pursuit, but I should have got away had it not been that a strong patrol came out through the gate {{at the other end of}} the bridge just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> and there was no course but to jump for it. I thrust my sword into the sheath, and went over. It added somewhat to my weight in the water, and it sunk my body below the surface, but with the aid of my hands paddling I floated so that only my nose and mouth were above the water; so that it is little wonder that they could not make me out. I landed on the other bank a quarter of a mile beyond the walls, slept in the forest, started this morning from Versailles, where I got rid of my other clothes and bought these. I purchased this basket and the vegetables at Sèvres, then walked boldly in. No one could have seen my face in the darkness, and therefore I am safe from detection, perhaps safer than I was before." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{says that}} I {{never meant to}} water it, which {{is not only a}} mistake, but unkind. My plan was to run downstairs {{immediately}} after dinner every evening and give it a thorough watering. One thing or another, however, came in the way. I often remembered about the chrysanthemum while I was in the office; but even Gilray could hardly have expected me to ask leave of absence merely to run home and water his plant. You must draw the line somewhere, even in a government office. When I reached home I was tired, inclined to take things easily, and not at all in a proper condition for watering flower-pots. Then Arcadians would drop in. I put it to any sensible man or woman, could I have been expected to give up my friends {{for the sake of a}} chrysanthemum? Again, it was my custom of an evening, if not disturbed, to retire with my pipe into my cane chair, and there pass the hours communing with great minds, or, when the mood was on me, trifling with a novel. Often when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a chapter Gilray's flower-pot stood up before my eyes crying for water. He does not believe this, but it is the solemn truth. At those moments it was touch and go, whether I watered his chrysanthemum or not. Where I lost myself was in not hurrying to his rooms at once with a tumbler. I said to myself that I would go when I had finished my pipe, but by that time the flower-pot had escaped my memory. This may have been weakness; all I know is that I should have saved myself much annoyance if I had risen and watered the chrysanthemum there and then. But would it not have been rather hard on me to have had to forsake my books for the sake of Gilray's flowers and flower-pots and plants and things? What right has a man to go and make a garden of his chambers? ...|$|E
