5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. <b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E

5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland.

Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping.

5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
