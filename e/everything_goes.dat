In March, the station drew a formal complaint from MP James McGrath against its airing of the 1969 Western film Heaven with a Gun, as the film featured scenes of violence which McGrath considered inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The station {{ran into}} a {{financial}} crisis within just three months. Due to the CRTC decision, it was forced to launch at midseason. Many companies had already allocated their advertising budgets for the season and had little money left to buy time on the newly minted network, {{and even some of}} the advertisers who had booked time on the network backed out in light of the 1973 oil crisis. In addition, the short-lived American adoption of year-round daylight saving time in January 1974, and the Ontario government's refusal to follow suit, had unexpectedly forced <b>Everything</b> <b>Goes,</b> promoted as the network's flagship show, into airing directly opposite The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and thus attracting disastrous ratings. As a result of the crisis, the station quickly lost access to its line of credit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, based on {{classified}} data {{about the state of}} the U.S. economy and society supplied to him by fellow analysts at FAPSI, Panarin forecast the probable disintegration of the US into six parts in 2010 (at the end of June – start of July 2010, as he specified on 10 December 2008), following a civil war triggered by mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation. He forecast financial and demographic changes provoking a political crisis in which wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government, effectively seceding from the Union, leading to social unrest, civil war, national division, and intervention of foreign powers. Panarin sees the task of the world elite as not letting the USA follow the Yugoslavian model of disintegration; it is desirable that it follows the Czechoslovakian model of disintegration so that <b>everything</b> <b>goes</b> calmly and peacefully.|$|E

25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time in what she {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. <b>Everything</b> <b>goes</b> well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she could have ever thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

500|$|The {{focus of}} most reviews {{was in the}} climactic final scene, whose {{directing}} and acting is universally acclaimed by critics. Writing for Cultural Learnings, Myles McNutt stated: [...] "the final shot, with Arya looking to the sky as <b>everything</b> <b>goes</b> to silence and all she sees is the birds flying was just wonderfully haunting. Alan Taylor's direction sold both the chaos and the resignation of that moment." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt that [...] "that final scene was so gorgeously shot, and the weariness of Bean's performance and the horror of Maisie Williams' so perfectly conveyed the emotions of it, even as things seemed so chaotic." ...|$|E
500|$|Peters, Pym, and Augustus hatch a plan {{to seize}} control of the ship: Pym, whose {{presence}} is unknown to the mutineers, will wait for a storm and then dress in the clothes of a recently dead sailor, masquerading as a ghost. In the confusion sure to break out among the superstitious sailors, Peters and Augustus, helped by Tiger, will take over the ship again. <b>Everything</b> <b>goes</b> according to plan, and soon the three men are masters of the Grampus: all the mutineers are killed or thrown overboard except one, Richard Parker, whom they spare to help them run the vessel. (At this point, the dog Tiger disappears from the novel; his unknown fate is a loose end in the narrative.) ...|$|E
500|$|After Val and Eric foster Amy, {{she starts}} acting rebellious again. She starts {{drinking}} and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts. Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails {{because she is}} convinced <b>everything</b> <b>goes</b> wrong in her life. [...] "She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first." [...] Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is [...] "light-hearted." [...] However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has [...] "gone too far" [...] and [...] "question their {{ability to cope with}} her." [...] Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was [...] "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and <b>everything</b> <b>goes</b> nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1977, both thirty-year-old {{security}} officer Miles and three-month-old infant Miles are {{living on the}} island. [...] Four survivors, Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid from Flight 815 who had been rescued nearly three years earlier on December 30, 2004 arrive on the island in 1977 after flying near the island in late 2007 and also join DHARMA, Sayid being a prisoner on suspicion of being an Other. [...] Miles still stays distant from his father, but, after talking to Hurley during a late-night chore, witnesses a peaceful moment between his younger self and his father. Three days later, the groups from the future are exposed as liars. [...] The next morning, Faraday comes clean to Chang that they are from the future and warns of a catastrophic [...] "incident" [...] that is due to occur at the building site for the Swan, DHARMA's planned island station dedicated to electromagnetism. [...] He instructs Chang to evacuate the island of non-essential personnel, which he does, ordering his wife and baby Miles to leave him, shortly after finding out that adult Miles is his son and confronting him about it. [...] Here, Miles realizes that he himself caused his father to order {{his mother and his}} three-month-old self to leave. Faraday theorizes that if [...] "Jughead" [...] – a hydrogen bomb that is buried on the island – is detonated at the Swan site by the underground electromagnetic pocket of energy, the timeline will be altered, preventing any of the group from the future from ever having come to the island in 2004, saving everyone who had died after they arrived. [...] The plan proceeds as planned, even though Miles expresses skepticism. [...] The antagonistic DHARMA members engage in a gunfight with Jack, believing him to be an Other, and Miles, Sawyer, Juliet, and Kate come to his aid. [...] When the Swan site goes haywire, Chang's arm is caught in the debris and Miles rushes to his side, saving him and calling him [...] "Dad". [...] After he tells his father to run as far as possible from the site, the bomb is detonated and <b>everything</b> <b>goes</b> to white, leaving Miles's status uncertain.|$|E
