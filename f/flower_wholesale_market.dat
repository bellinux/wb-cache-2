40|$|Currently, {{the major}} {{marketing}} channel for flower suppliers and retailers in Taiwan is the <b>flower</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>market.</b> However, when the retailers make purchases in the wholesale market, the dominant suppliers offer poor service, and the retailers find it inconvenient {{to collect information}} {{on the price of}} flowers. Our study shows that the E-Commerce mechanism of the e-marketplace can improve trading efficiency and lower the cost of collecting information as well as the purchase price. According to our analysis, the e- marketplace can use ''a combination of pictures, literal description, and regulated classiffication'' to introduce the quality of flower products. By Fuzzy Delphi, the key factors which affect the operation modes between the retailer and the e-marketplace are ''cooperation on urgent orders'', ''accuracy of order processing'', and ''order processing efficiency''. Then, based on the three key factors, we use Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making to find what operation modes the e-marketplace should take to cooperate with the retailer. Retailers find the three operation modes ''actively placing orders'', ''jointly negotiating prices'', and ''free bidding'' equally compatible, so we suggest that the e- marketplace should provide these modes at the same time for retailer use and later the retailers can adjust the modes according to their business performance.

The <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> system regulated by the WML and considered as a main fish marketing channel has reduced its function and role in the recent decades. It was caused by an appearance of large scale fish suppliers and consumers such as supermarkets which play the role in fixing price, classifying equal quality, and ensuring a constant supply. In addition, {{the volume of the}} fisheries products handled at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> is decreased, while a competition between <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and the outsiders is increased. At the same time, many wholesalers and middle-wholesalers in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are also having financial difficulties. The principle on the marketing method of the WML has been differed expandedly from the recent trend of business style. The WML was amended in 1999 for the purpose of negotiation behavior if the wholesalers that should be changed in term of bargaining power enabling the wholesalers to have more ability to compete in fresh food merchandise. Prospect of the consequences are: (1) The amendment of the WML will create various types of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and/or wholesalers, especially in the strategy and scale of their management.

40|$|In the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (PRC), since 1978 {{when the}} Communist Party adapted the {{political}} resolution on promoting economic reform and liberalization at the Third Plenary Session of the 11 th General Committee held in Beijing, three laws were {{enacted by the}} central government regarding the establishment and operation of whole sale markets for agricultural products and fair trade markets for foodstuff. These laws have become widespread and now apply to <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> in big cities and fair trade markets in most residential areas, all over the PRC. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the character of the three laws by comparing them with the Japan 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Central <b>Wholesale</b> <b>Market</b> Law 2 ̆ 7 which was enacted by the Japanese Diet in 1971. The first law is the 2 ̆ 7 Administrative Act on Fair Trade Markets in Urban and Rural Areas 2 ̆ 7, which was enacted in 1983. This law has played a significant role in the establishment and administration of the fair trade markets. Furthermore, to a certain degree it also had directive function on <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> set up. However, this act doesn 2 ̆ 7 t include provisions for the management of <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> yet. The second law is the 2 ̆ 7 Register Administrative Act on Commodity Trade Markets 2 ̆ 7, which was enacted in 1993 and revised in 1996. Under this act, commodity trade markets have been established and pay tax for operation of the retail business. The third law is the 2 ̆ 7 Administrative Act on <b>Wholesale</b> <b>Markets</b> 2 ̆ 7 which was enacted in 1994. This is the first act on <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> in the PRC. It not only gives a definition of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> but also detailed regulations on establishment, administration and the operation of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> trading and fostering dealers, etc. This act is regarded as a symbol of agricultural products marketing system that is shifting from quantity growth to quality improvement. A comparison of the present situation of <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> with this act indicated that this act will play important roles in the aspects of (1) separation of administrator, investor and manager, (2) classification between <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and fair trade <b>markets,</b> central <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> and local <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets,</b> (3) unitary permission procedures, (4) fostering dealers, (5) improvement of <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> information, and so on. Therefore, this act will contribute to the development of agricultural produce <b>wholesale</b> <b>marketing</b> system and price stability at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>market</b> level in the PRC. 以上のように,卸売市場の開設と運営に関連しながら,中国における農産物流通制度の改革の中で集貿市場の復活拡大と卸売市場の出現発展,それらにかかわっている三つの卸売市場法規の目的と内容を明らかにし,特に卸売市場の開設･運営の実態と「卸売市場に関する管理弁法」との乖離点及びこの「弁法」の意義を検討してきた. こうした検討を通じて,以下のようなことが明らかになったといえるであろう. (1) 1983 年の「都市と農村における集市貿易に関する管理弁法」は集貿市場の開設と管理に重要な役割を果たし,卸売市場にも一時期役に立った. しかし,卸売市場の運営について同「弁法」は言及していない. (2) 1993 年に制定, 1996 年に改正された「商品取引市場の登録管理に関する弁法」は,すべての商品交易市場対して登録管理法規として役割を果たしたが, 1993 年以来,同弁法によって種々の市場管理体制が強化されてきた. (3) 「卸売市場に関する管理弁法」は,中国初の卸売市場に関する法規であり,卸売市場の開設,そして市場管理,市場運営,取引方法,取扱業者の育成など諸方面について詳しく定めている. この弁法は中国の卸売市場整備上,量的発展段階から質的整備段階へと転換していく標識として位置付けられている. 実際には,卸売市場の設立,運営の実態との比較によって,同弁法は①卸売市場の管理者,投資者及び経営者の分離,②卸売市場と集貿市場,中央卸売市場と地方卸売市場の区分,③卸売市場開設の許可手続きの簡素化,④取扱業者の経営能力養成,及び⑤卸売市場情報システムの改善等について重要な役割を発揮しているであろう. 以上の改善を通じて,同「弁法」が農産物流通の円滑化と価格安定に大きく貢献していくことが期待される...|$|R

The vegetables and fruits markets information (NAPASS) and the competitive-producing district analysis system, which was developed by Matsuyama, were used as the analysis method and technique respectively. The results are as follows: Hokkaido competes with Aomori from July to October when Hokkaido-produced radishes enter <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> across Japan. In order to clarify the characteristics of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes are delivered, three types were classified by market share (from July through October). Type I (market share 30 %〜 60 %) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes compete with ones from other districts. Type II (60 %〜) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes register larger quantity per day than type I. Type III (〜 30 %) shows the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> where Hokkaido-produced radishes register smaller quantity per day than type I. More than half of type III <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> are largely supplied by local districts, therefore increased shipments of Hokkaido-produced radishes can be expected depending on the situation of the local districts.
