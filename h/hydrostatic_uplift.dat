40|$|Abstract. Taking the Lijiapo {{landslide}} in Three Gorges Area as an example, {{the study}} {{on the impact of}} seepage field changes caused by water level fluctuation on reservoir landslide stability was carried out. In order to find out the variation in slope stability when the reservoir water level changes at different rate, the stability calculation model was established adopting the Seep module and Slope module of Geoscience software GeoStudio, and calibrated with a long sequence of real-time monitoring data, based on the landslide survey data and test data. The results show that the reservoir landslide stability affected by the seepage field changes with changing reservoir level is controlled by a variety of factors, including the hydrodynamic pressure, <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure, <b>uplift</b> force, physical and mechanical properties (с, φ value change). When the water level fluctuates at a high rate, the impact of the seepage field changes on the stability is mainly affected by the pore water pressure before the stability reaches the extremum, while after the extremum, with the further infiltration or drainage of reservoir water, it is mainly affected by the change of physical and mechanical properties. When the water level fluctuates at a lower rate, the pore water pressure, uplift force and physical and mechanical properties are the dominant factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Focusing on {{physical}} processes, {{we aim at}} constraining the dynamics of argon (Ar), a biogeochemically inert gas, within first year sea ice, using observation data and a one-dimensional halo-thermodynamic sea ice model, including parameterization of gas physics. The incorporation and transport of dissolved Ar within sea ice and its rejection via gas-enriched brine drainage to the ocean, are modeled following fluid transport equations through sea ice. Gas bubbles nucleate within sea ice when Ar is above saturation and when the total partial pressure of all three major atmospheric gases (N 2, O 2 and Ar) is above the brine <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure. The <b>uplift</b> of gas bubbles due to buoyancy is allowed when the brine network is connected with a brine volume above a given threshold. Ice-atmosphere Ar fluxes are formulated as a diffusive process proportional to the differential partial pressure of Ar between brine inclusions and the atmosphere. Two simulations corresponding to two case studies that took place at Point Barrow (Alaska, 2009) and during an ice-tank experiment (INTERICE IV, Hamburg, Germany, 2009) are presented. Basal entrapment and vertical transport due to brine motion enable a qualitatively sound representation of the vertical profile of the total Ar (i. e. the Ar dissolved in brine inclusions and contained in gas bubbles; TAr). Sensitivity analyses suggest that gas bubble nucleation and rise are of most importance to describe gas dynamics within sea ice. Ice-atmosphere Ar fluxes and the associated parameters do not drastically change the simulated TAr. Ar dynamics are dominated by uptake, transport by brine dynamics and bubble nucleation in winter and early spring; and by an intense and rapid release of gas bubbles to the atmosphere in spring. Important physical processes driving gas dynamics in sea ice are identified, pointing {{to the need for}} further field and experimental studies. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Uplift {{pressure}} {{can be defined}} as the hydrostatic force of water exerted on or underneath a structure tending to cause a displacement of the structure. This force is quite common in structures such as dams and tunnels. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>uplift</b> can become significant when considering the size of structures such as dams or tunnels. However structural failures have occurred due to the failure to design for <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>uplift.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the forces that <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>uplift</b> can exert on a structure when it is subjected to a high water table using a flow net approach. An experimental analysis was constructed in a drainage and seepage tank to model the performance of the structure and the magnitude of the uplift forces as the level of water table varied. This dissertation contains a brief history of <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>Uplift,</b> some failures which have occurred due to it and the theories associated with it. The theoretical and experimental results will be compared and discussed and conclusions will be drawn as to the reliability of the methods associated with analysing <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>Uplift.</b> This paper concludes that analysing the effects of <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>Uplift</b> by using a flow net approach, does provide a reasonable and conservative estimate of the actual hydrostatic pressure...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{facilities}} {{located in}} coastal areas subject to tsunami hazards {{may be at}} risk of tsunami impact and damage. Furthermore, if hazardous materials are present these can be accidentally released impacting nearby residents and dispersing into the environment. In this report we present the results of a study which analyzed the potential impact of two tsunamis originating in the Tyrrhenian Sea and their consequences at an industrial facility located on the coast in north-eastern Sicily. The results of the tsunami simulations indicate that in both scenarios there would be eighteen storage tanks (of 43 located within 400 m from the shoreline) at the industrial facility subject to flooding, with tanks closer to the shoreline suffering up to 0. 8 m inundation. Flow velocities in most areas are less than 1 m/s. This indicates that any damage would occur due to <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>uplift</b> forces due to buoyancy particularly {{in the western part of}} the facility where inundation levels are higher and storage tanks are less protected. Potential damage caused by impact of floating debris may be a problem in an area near the shoreline just west of a pumping station and warehouse (central section of the refinery near the shoreline) due to high flow velocities (3 - 4 m/s) in both tsunami scenarios. Foundation soils and foundation systems could also be at risk from shear- and liquefaction-induced scour in this section of the plant. The likelihood for hazardous materials releases from inundated storage tanks is low but could occur due to breakage of connected pipelines and flanges due to buoyancy, or due to floating off of almost empty storage tanks and connected pipelines. Flooding of electrical equipment, such as control panels, pumps, and motors not raised above the inundation level could result in salt water intrusion leading to possible short circuit, hampering of safety and mitigation systems, process upsets and possible hazardous materials releases. We conclude however that in the two scenarios studied, the consequences of potential hazardous materials releases, fires or explosions triggered by the tsunamis on nearby residents and neighbouring facilities are likely to be small. Nevertheless, we make recommendations for preventive and preparedness measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of tsunami-triggered Natech accidents and to mitigate their consequences if they do occur.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} {{an active role}} of sea ice as a source or sink for climatically {{significant}} gases such as CO 2 and dimethylsulfide (DMS). In this context, modelling can help to understand and upscale the physical and biogeochemical processes that affect gas production, consumption and transport within sea ice. Focusing on physical processes, we aim at constraining the dynamics of Argon (Ar), a biogeochemically inert gas, within first year sea ice, using observation data and a one-dimensional halo-thermodynamic sea ice model, including parameterization of gas physics. The incorporation and transport of dissolved Ar within sea ice and its rejection via gas-enriched brine drainage to the ocean, are modeled following fluid transport equations through sea ice. Gas bubbles nucleate within sea ice when Ar is above saturation and when the total partial pressure of all four major atmospheric gases (N 2, O 2, Ar and CO 2) is above the brine <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure.

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} edifices {{are subject}} to flank failure, usually produced {{by a combination of}} events, rather than any single process. From a dynamic point of view, the cause of collapse can be divided into factors that contribute to an increase in shear stress, and factors that contribute to the reduction in the friction coefficient μ of a potential basal failure plane. We study the potential for flank failure at Mount Etna considering a schematic section of the eastern flank, approximated by a wedge-like block. For such geometry, we perform a (steady state) limit equilibrium analysis: the resolution of the forces parallel to the possible basal failure plane allows us to determine the total force acting on the potentially unstable wedge. An estimate of the relative strength of these forces suggests that, in first approximation, the stability is controlled primarily by the balance between block weight, lithostatic load and magmatic forces. Any other force (sea load, <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>uplift,</b> and the uplift due to mechanical and thermal pore-fluid pressure) may be considered of second order. To study the model sensitivity, we let the inferred slope α of the basal surface failure vary between − 10 ° and 10 °, and consider three possible scenarios: no magma loading, magmastatic load, and magmastatic load with magma overpressure. We use error propagation to include in our analysis the uncertainties in the estimates of the mechanics and geometrical parameters controlling the block equilibrium. When there is no magma loading, the ratio between destabilizing and stabilizing forces is usually smaller than the coefficient of friction of the basal failure plane. In the absence of an initiating mechanism, and with the nominal values of the coefficient of friction μ = 0. 7 ± 0. 1 proposed, the representative wedge will remain stable or continue to move at constant speed. In presence of magmastatic forces, the influence of the lateral restraint decreases. If we consider the magmastatic load only, the block will remain stable (or continue to move at constant speed), unless the transient mechanical and thermal pressurization significantly decrease the friction coefficient, increasing the instability of the flank wedge for α > 5 ° (seaward dipping decollement). When the magma overpressure contribution is included in the equilibrium analysis, the ratio between destabilizing and stabilizing forces is of the same order or larger than the coefficient of friction of the basal failure plane, and the block will become unstable (or accelerate), {{especially in the case of}} the reduction in friction coefficient. Finally, our work suggests that the major challenge in studying flank instability at Mount Etna is not the lack of an appropriate physical model, but the limited knowledge of the mechanical and geometrical parameters describing the block equilibrium...|$|E
