5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In any case, it is probable that more Persians were <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> part of Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans {{called for the}} extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E

5|$|The Nara period (710–784) of the 8th century marked an {{emergence}} of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara).

The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> much as one-third of Japan's population.

5|$|The global {{mortality}} rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% {{of those who}} were infected died. With {{about a third of the}} world population infected, this case-fatality ratio means 3% to 6% of the entire global population died. Influenza may have <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> many as 25million people in its first 25 weeks. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while current estimates say 50–100million people worldwide were killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were <b>killed.</b> <b>As</b> hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E

5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were <b>killed,</b> <b>as</b> were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|Although not yet ordained, Gerard {{was rewarded}} with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his {{ordination}} as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of St Paul's Cathedral in London on 9 June 1096. He {{may have been a}} member of the hunting party in the New Forest on 2 August 1100 when Rufus was <b>killed,</b> <b>as</b> he witnessed King Henry I's coronation charter– now known as the Charter of Liberties– three days later at Winchester, close by the New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry's coronation that same day, along with Maurice, Bishop of London. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was <b>killed</b> <b>as</b> a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
