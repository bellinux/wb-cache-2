A number of measurements on emissions of dioxins has been carried out with respect to <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>waste</b> and processes in the metal industry. The estimates of the emissions of dioxins at most sources have been based on literature, information about industrial processes in the Netherlands and sometimes on one or two measurements in the Netherlands. The total emission of dioxins in the Netherlands is about 950 g TEQ per year. About 800 g of this quantity is due to the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>waste...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractMajor {{secondary}} pollutants {{arising from the}} <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>waste</b> are as follows: dioxin, heavy metal element and acid oxide. They are produced by the recombined elements during oxidation when pollutants are decomposing during incineration. As you sow, so will you reap. Secondary pollutants arising from incineration exist owing to the former carrier of these pollutants in the fuel, coupled with conditions required for recombination. Facts have proven that processing domestic waste, once there is dioxin and heavy metal element, will be extremely difficulty, costing {{a huge amount of}} money and producing poor effects. This paper mainly discusses how dioxin and heavy metal element arise from the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>waste,</b> preventive measures and the significance of prevention...|$|R

5000|$|Jackson specialised, as {{parliamentary}} rapporteur, on waste legislation. She {{took the}} Landfill Directive through the Parliament in 1997-8. In 2008 she was rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. Initially criticised {{as being too}} close to the waste industry lobby, Jackson managed to unite most of her opponents in support of an ambitious final text which the Council of Ministers only agreed with reluctance. This placed an obligation on Member States to achieve recycling rates of 50% by 2020, created for the Commission the possibility of putting in place waste reduction targets and cleared up the question of the status of <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> as a form of [...] "recovery" [...] rather than [...] "disposal".|$|E
50|$|In 2002 SELCHP {{was subject}} to direct action by Greenpeace UK. They were {{concerned}} about the potential negative health effects of the dioxins produced during the <b>incineration</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> at the site. The plant was shut down {{for three and a half}} days when protesters entered the main tipping hall and climbed the chimney. The standoff was resolved when bailiffs entered the building and removed the protestors. As a result of the action both Liberal Democrats on Lewisham Council and the Shadow Environment Secretary Peter Ainsworth pledged their support to the campaign.No emissions of dioxins or other regulated substances emitted by the SELCHP Plant have ever been found to be outside of permitted levels. Records of emissions are publicly available, as is the case with all similar Energy from Waste Plants.|$|E
