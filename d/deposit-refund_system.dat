The thesis deals with regulation of these instruments not only in general, but mainly in the current Czech law and in relation to the protection of soil and pieces of land. The thesis consists of four parts which are subdivided into chapters. In Part 1 there is a short description of the evolution of environmental policy and its tools. Part 2 describes economic instruments in general, their functions and types (fees, taxes, tradable permits, instruments to ensure duties and responsibility, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>systems,</b> customs duties, public (state) aid instruments). Part 3 deals with economic instruments in current Czech law and Part 4 contains a more detailed analysis of these instruments relating to the protection of soil and pieces of land.

Second, other recent work suggests that it may be possible to design a renegotiation-proof climate agreement with broad or even full participation.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{estimate}} the costs of implementation of the <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> for packaging of beverage drinks in Latvia, and to evaluate the economic feasibility of the system in the period up to 2020. Design/methodology/approach – The economic assessment {{is based on the}} projections of the future consumption of beverage drinks, and of the amount of deposit packaging respectively. Investment, collection, transportation, maintenance and other system operating costs are considered. An evaluation is made to compare the producers’ costs in the existing curbside collection system and in <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system.</b> Findings – The costs of the <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> depend on the amount of packaging placed on the market. The amount of deposit packaging, in its turn, depends on the consumption of beverage drinks affected by GDP. The implementation of the <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> would cause an increase in the beverage drink packaging costs, as producers would need to pay the service charge to cover the costs of the system operator. The assumed return rates of deposit packaging exceed the existing recovery rates. Thus, compared to the curbside collection system the recovery of PET, glass and aluminum has increased, whereas the amount of landfilled waste – decreased. Originality/value – For several years there have been on-going discussions on implementation of the packaging <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> in Latvia. However, there are no academic studies available, applicable to evaluate the economic aspects of the system implementation. The paper presents the methodology for assessing the investment, collection, maintenance and other costs, as well as provides the results of estimated costs of the packaging <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> in Latvia in the period up to 2020...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a unique}} dataset collected during a 2006 {{national survey of}} U.

After estimating either generalized ordered logit or multinomial logit models, {{we find that the}} most important determinants of household recycling are people 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward recycling. Our results also suggest that omitting internal variables (perceived recycling obstacles and benefits as well as moral considerations) may bias policy coefficients. Socio-economic variables are typically not statistically significant, with the exceptions of young adults and of African Americans who tend to recycle less than others. Policies with the largest odds ratios are curbside recycling (which is further strengthened if recycling is mandatory), followed by the presence of drop-off collection centers nearby. Bottle bills are also statistically significant but their odds ratios are smaller, possibly because refunds are relatively small and typically do not change for years. Finally, marginal pricing appears to have a limited impact on recycling. These results suggest avenues for improving household recycling at a time when recycling rates appear to be plateauing...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Deposit-refund</b> <b>systems</b> or {{container}} deposit legislation, {{also known}} as [...] "bottle bills", can be viewed either as a tax on producing waste {{in the form of}} beverage containers or as a subsidy for properly recycling these containers. When a retailer buys products from a distributor, it must pay a deposit for each beverage container it purchases. The retailer then includes the cost of the deposit in the item's price, passing it to the consumer. However, the consumer is refunded this money by properly disposing of the used beverage container at a retail or redemption center. The retailer also recoups the deposit from the distributor. This system encourages consumers to properly dispose of the waste they generate by buying beverages in disposable containers. It also creates a privately funded system for the handling of this waste. A deposit-refund bill named National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act was introduced by the House of Representatives in 1994 but never became federal law.Bottle bills are currently in place in ten states as well as in Guam. Delaware repealed its bottle bill in 2010. Oregon was the first state to institute a bottle bill in 1971. The most common deposit is five cents, but this varies by state and by the type of container.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{policies}} typically {{combine the}} identification of a goal with some means to achieve that goal. This chapter focuses exclusively on the second component, the means [...] the "instruments" [...] of environmental policy, and considers, in particular, experience {{around the world with}} the relatively new breed of economic-incentive or market-based policy instruments. I define these instruments broadly, and consider them within four categories: charge systems; tradable permits; market friction reductions; and government subsidy reductions. Within charge systems, I consider effluent charges, <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>systems,</b> user charges, insurance premium taxes, sales taxes, administrative charges, and tax differentiation. Within tradeable permit systems, I consider both credit programs and cap-and-trade systems. Under the heading of reducing market frictions, I examine market creation, liability rules, and information programs. Finally, under reducing government subsidies, I review a number of specific examples from around the world. By defining market-based instruments broadly, I cast a large net for this review of applications. As a consequence, the review is extensive. But this should not leave the impression that market-based instruments have replaced, or have come anywhere close to replacing, the conventional, command-and-control approach to environmental protection. Further, even where these approaches have been used in their purest form and with some success, such {{as in the case of}} tradeable-permit systems in the United States, they have not always performed as anticipated. In the final part of the chapter, I ask what lessons can be learned from our experiences. In particular, I consider normative lessons for design and implementation, analysis of prospective and adopted systems, and identification of new applications. ...|$|R
40|$|In Latvia, {{for more}} than a decade a {{container}} system for packaging waste segregation has been in a continuous process of development – starting with the first containers in the beginning of 2000 ’s until now, when there are efforts made to provide containers to people living in rural areas. Although the regeneration targets set by EU are fulfilled by the existing system, it is still considered as not effective enough. In many cases the existing system is considered as economically and even environmentally unsustainable, but it is still maintained due to governmental pressure. At the same time, for about last five years hot discussions are held on implementation of packaging deposit system which would operate in parallel with the existing containers’ system.

40|$|The {{results of}} this {{research}} are promising and suggest that contingent valuation is a practical way to make rough estimations of the benefits accrued from environmental policies, for reducing the risks of past environmental burdens, and for making comparisons with costs within a cost-benefit analysis. Contingent valuation provided a means of quantifying consumer preferences and values. However, an important constraint in this research is that the method (word pictures) used to present risks was quite general and lacked the specificity that {{would be useful to}} employ in future studies. A more detailed formulation would result in a more precise pricing of risks. This research examined three general categories of risk and then explored the specific case of a battery <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system.</b> This research suggests that in the specific situation of used batteries, the benefits from reduction of risks are higher than the costs associated with introducing a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> as perceived by households. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the second-best household's waste recycling policy. If we assume the first-best economy with no illegal disposal or transaction costs, then unit pricing, an advance disposal fee and a recycling subsidy are required {{in order to}} achieve the social optimum such that both the sum of unit pricing and an advance disposal fee and the sum of unit pricing and a recycling subsidy are equal to the marginal disposal cost. Furthermore, the first-best outcome can also be obtained by a producer take-back requirement system. In the real economy, however, various factors prevent the first-best optimal outcome. In this study we consider two factors, one being the transaction cost associated with a recycling subsidy (or refund) and the other being illegal disposal by the consumer. If a recycling subsidy (or a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system)</b> is adopted, a transaction cost associated with it will be generated. Alternatively, if unit pricing is adopted, some of the consumed goods may be disposed of illegally. We show the complete trade-off between unit pricing and a recycling subsidy. In other words, we can not adopt unit pricing and a recycling subsidy simultaneously. As a result, there are three candidates for the second-best policy: unit pricing with an advance disposal fee, a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system,</b> and a producer take-back requirement system. Which of these three policies is the second-best policy will depend on the relative magnitude of the price of a recycled good and the marginal transaction cost associated with a recycling subsidy (or the refund in a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system).</b> Generally, if the price of a recycled good is positive and the marginal transaction cost is relatively high, unit pricing with an advance disposal fee is the second-best policy. However, where the price of a recycled good is negative and the marginal transaction cost is relatively high, a producer take-back requirement system is the second-best policy. Further, where the marginal transaction cost is relatively low, a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> is the second-best policy, regardless of whether the price of a recycled good is positive or negative.

40|$|Environmental policy {{instruments}} allow incorporating {{the problem of}} using the natural resources into the decision-making process of individual agents. One of the most efficient instruments for environmental protection are economic instruments, the indirect methods of influencing agents’ behaviour. The aim of the article is to present {{the state of the}} Polish system of economic instruments in the light of other European countries’ experiences (especially the European Union countries) and prospects for the use of economic instruments in the environmental policy during the oncoming years. The study is based on a subject literature review, reports ordered by the Polish Ministry of Environment and publications published by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OE CD) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The analysis suggests that economic instruments are widely used in the Polish environmental policy. The main economic instruments in this policy are environmental charges and fines. Some of these charges and fines have been used in the Polish environmental policy for several dozen years. Revenues from these instruments are earmarked for environmental expenditures. There are also some new, interesting economic instruments applied in the Polish environmental policy, such as: <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>systems,</b> tradable energy certificates and emissions trading scheme. There are some opportunities for expanding the use of economic instruments for the environmental policy in Poland. For example, there could be increased the use of some environmental charges or taxes, and the environmental insurance.

40|$|Two decades ago, a “command-and-control approach” {{dominated}} {{environmental policy}} and regulations. Individual decision makers were told how {{to comply with}} an input or output standard, rather than being allowed to respond to market signals in the most economical way. Until well into the 1970 s, few market-based instruments for environmental policy existed. Even then, examples were limited to an effluent charge program in Germany, some <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>systems,</b> and— depending on one’s definition of a market-based instrument—performance bonds, which require potential polluters to demonstrate that they can compensate those damaged by their activities. In addition, a few markets were created to protect natural resources, such as transferable quotas for fishing in Canada and Iceland, and transferable development rights for land in the New Jersey Pine Barrens {{and a few other}} locations in the United States. Created markets to protect the environment from pollution were conspicuously absent until 1975 when the U. S. EPA introduced “bubbles ” and other approaches to relaxing economic growth restrictions for areas violating air quality standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA). This “bubble policy ” allows a plan with multiple stacks to meet its emissions limits over all stacks at once rather than each stack separately. Everything changed in 1990 when Congress broke the logjam over legislation to limit acid rain by reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions from power plants. Industry opposed the estimated huge cost of a command-andcontrol program, while environmentalists adamantly fought to bring plant emissions under tight control. To end the controversy, Congress and the first Bush administration turned to tradable pollution permits. In the late 1960 s, economists Crocker (1) and Dales (2) first introduced the idea of capping total emissions and allowing polluters to trade them. The idea had gained currency among economists because trading would be far less expensive than a command-and-control regulatory policy and could guarantee environmental improvements if a hard cap on total SO 2 emissions were set and backed up by continuous emissions monitoring. Further, the initial allocation of trad...|$|R
40|$|Hazardous wastes such as spent {{solvents}} and heavy-metal paint waste {{are characterized}} by certain adverse properties which include toxicity, reactivity, corrosivity, and flammability. Improper disposal of hazardous wastes may lead to air pollution, water pollution, or soil contamination which are dangerous for human health and for the ecosystem. These effects are known as externalities if the consequences, or costs, are not considered in the waste-generators' decisions. Due to externality, the social costs, including externality costs, and private costs diverge. Since the Love Canal event, hazardous waste disposal (HWD) has drawn national attention. A Roper poll reported that hazardous waste was perceived by the American public {{as the most important}} environmental problem (EPA, 1987; cited by Hammitt, 1988).

When illicit burning or dumping is a third disposal option, however, the optimizing fee for garbage collection can change sign.

40|$|We analyze {{alternative}} policies {{such as a}} disposal content fee, {{a subsidy}} for recyclable designs, unit pricing of household disposal, a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system,</b> and a manufacturer `take-back' requirement. In order to identify the problem being addressed, we build a simple general equilibrium model in which household utility depends on a negative externality from total waste generation, and in which firms use primary and recycled inputs to produce output that has two `attributes': packaging per unit output, and recyclability. If households pay the social cost of disposal, then they send the right signals to producers to reduce packaging and to design products that can more easily be recycled. But if local governments are constrained to collect household garbage for free, then households do not send the right signals to producers. The socially optimal attributes can still be achieved by a tax on producers' use of packaging and subsidy to producers' use of recyclable designs. ...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how new <b>system</b> {{initiatives}} around <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>systems</b> (DRS) and end-of-life management (EoLM) could merge {{and possibly}} {{lead to a}} circular and sustainable transition path of metal resources embedded in information and communications technology (ICT) products. Seen through the object of mobile phones, the cardinal objective has been {{to find ways of}} approaching full recycling and recovery of the finite metals and to see how these could be cycled back into the supply chain. In this way, bypassing environmental and social externalities in the pre-manufacturing phase from the use of virgin resources. Inspired by the transformative approach in backcasting methodology, this study builds a vision for a sustainable future of ICT products, by analyzing approaches to circular economy (Boulding) (Stahel) and how it conforms to the sustainability approach in environmental and ecological economics respectively. This vision is used to make a sustainable gap analysis of the present postcommercialisation ICT product life cycle, and to define a set of goals along information transfer, resource and value transfer and needs of technological innovation, for increased recycling and recovery of metals. This leads up to a scenario analysis for a DRS on mobile phones and the search for new opportunities in EoLM. Empirical studies for the analysis are based on a larger consumer survey around mobile phones and formal semi-structured interviews of individuals in relation to the present collection, pre-processing and end-processing stages of e-waste. The main conclusion is that a DRS system is deemed able to create a solid foundation for effective endcollection throughout the post-commercialization product life cycle and is able to transfer valuable resources and information to the EoL phase. EoLM can ensure better recovery if original equipment manufactures (OEMs) engage by using the opportunities of reversed logistics and sub-contracting the scrap-resource to end-processors. Here, {{there is a need to}} certify the processing of e-waste and to provide eco-rating systems of products, to ensure sustainability in the system and provide measurable and transparent lifecycle product profiles in the future. If such system initiatives are broadly adopted, the analysis shows that needed technological eco-innovation of products could emerge as a result of efficient collection, symbiotic network possibilities in EoL and possible push-effects from political consumers. Therefore, this study contributes to the planning field of sustainable production and consumption systems by qualifying a combined scenario on how to design and approach the opportunities in DRS and EoLM...|$|R

Our model explicitly allows {{for changes in the}} composition (quality) of waste streams depending on how much effort households are willing to spend on separating different types of waste. Accordingly, we are able to generalize some earlier contributions to the waste management literature and demonstrate that with both mixing and effort included, a first-best optimum is feasible under reasonable conditions. In particular, we find that a (modified) <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system</b> still provides the optimal incentives to guide recycling as well as legal disposal (landfilling) and illegal dumping. Both the number and level of taxes and subsidies needed to reach the first-best depend crucially on the socially optimal level of dumping as well as the socially optimal composition of the mix.

40|$|This paper builds two simple general {{equilibrium}} {{models to}} demonstrate the equivalence between the Pigovian tax and {{the combination of a}} presumptive tax and an environmental subsidy. A presumptive tax is a tax that is imposed under the presumption that all production uses a dirty technology or all consumption goods become waste.

To analyze the usefulness of the tax-subsidy combination, we review conceptual considerations regarding its implementation and practical considerations regarding its actual use throughout the world. While the tax-subsidy combination is increasingly being used, in the form of a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system,</b> we argue that more flexible interpretations are important to explore. The two parts of such a policy do not have to apply to the same side of the market. The tax and subsidy do not have to equal one another, and they can apply to different goods altogether.

They are preceded by brief introduction where I explain the impor- tance of environmental protection and outline how to reach it by using different instruments. Part One deals with the description of legal instruments as the basic instruments of the environmental policy. Legal regulation is primarily based on general legal rules and system of consents and permits based on individual administrative acts, all bac- ked by administrative or criminal sanctions. The another important function of legal regulation is fixing the standards (especially emission and immission limits).

40|$|The {{real-world}} {{application of}} a <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system,</b> though recommended in various studies, has not caught on. The gap {{can be attributed to}} the negative impacts on suppliers caused by the introduction of the system. This aspect has been ignored in previous studies. This paper considers the welfare implications of policies mitigating those impacts. Using welfare analysis, we consider three mitigation policies in an economy with n num-ber of representative consumers, a representative supplier, and the government. One policy is to let suppliers keep unredeemed deposits, which are the difference between deposits and refunds. Another policy is paying a handling commission to the suppliers. The other policy is subsidizing the initial cost for the collection of materials. The result can be summarized in three points. First, the government should hold unre-deemed deposits when a deposit level is set to be equal to externality. In this case, however, there is a possibility that the negative impacts on suppliers could further deteriorate. Sec-ond, whether or not the handling commission is paid does not matter; however, paying a handling commission could increase the burden on the suppliers. Third, subsidizing the initial cost also does not matter, however it is related to fairness among the consumer and the producer...|$|E

Deposit-refunds are used for beverage containers, lead-acid batteries, motor oil, tires, various hazardous materials, electronics, and more. In addition, researchers {{have shown that the}} approach can be used to address many other environmental problems beyond waste disposal. By imposing an up-front fee on consumption and subsidizing “green” inputs and mitigation activities, a deposit-refund may be able to efficiently control pollution {{in much the same way}} as a Pigovian tax. Theoretical models have shown that alternative waste disposal policies, such as virgin materials taxes, advance disposal fees, recycled content standards, and recycling subsidies are inferior to a deposit-refund. These results have been corroborated in calibrated models of U. S. waste and recycling. And in theoretical models that consider joint environmental problems and product design considerations, the deposit-refund continues to have much to recommend it as a component of an overall socially optimal set of policies. More empirical research into deposit-refund systems is needed, particularly the upstream systems used for many products. In these systems, the processors or collectors of recyclables—rather than consumers—receive the refund.

The tax-subsidy combination is explained in terms of a tax effect, an environmental effect, and a revenue effect. The model allows for flexible interpretation, to show various applications of the 2 PI. We also discuss important caveats, cases where the 2 PI may not be appropriate. two-part instrument, second-best theory, optimal tax, distortionary taxation, market-based instrument, environmental externality...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an upsurge of {{interest}} in the principle of extended producer responsibility (EPR) among policy makers and scholars in non-OECD countries. The principle has been applied and its impacts studied rather extensively in various OECD countries. However, similar experiences are largely lacking in non-OECD countries. This paper presents some ongoing research and preliminary findings on the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). The research aims to explore both potentials and limitations of EPR under non-OECD conditions. Hitherto, there have been four projects in three countries: India, Thailand, and Argentina. The first project in India in 2007 investigated the specificity of this non-OECD context and the explanatory boundary of the principle. The second phase of the research studies a WEEE policy development in the three countries. At the time of writing, they appear to follow different courses of action. The India Government issued a guideline suggesting an incorporation of WEEE under the existing Hazardous Waste Rules. The Thai Government shows particular interest in economic instruments, such as product fees and <b>deposit-refund</b> <b>system,</b> and has been working on a draft law that would govern the use of these instruments for the management of some WEEE and other used products. In Argentina, a senator proposed a dedicated WEEE framework law based on EPR. Our analysis identifies collection of post-consumer WEEE as a major practical bottleneck particularly when there is a strong presence of the so-called informal sector. EPR can be a driving force for improvements by mobilising resources from producers and channelling them to end-of-life management. In addition, in a long run, it can lead to design changes in products and product systems. However, market anomalies in a non-OECD context such as sizeable black/grey markets for several product groups and/or illegal import of used products can put identifiable legal producers at a disadvantageous position and retard feedback mechanisms in an EPR programme. Thus, the applicability of policy alternatives should be assessed against the conditions of particular contexts. We also discuss the importance of problem definition in policy processes...|$|E
