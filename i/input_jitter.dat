40|$|We {{consider}} how {{the output of the}} perfect integrate-and-fire (I&F) model of a single neuron is affected by the properties of the input, first of all by the distribution of afferent excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP, IPSP) inter-arrival times, discriminating particularly between short- and longtailed forms, and by the degree of balance between excitation and inhibition (as measured by the ratio, r, between the numbers of inhibitory and excitatory inputs). We find that the coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation divided by mean) of e€erent interspike interval (ISI) is an increasing function of the length of the tail of the distribution of EPSP inter-arrival times and the ratio r. There is a range of values of r in which the CV of output ISIs is between 0. 5 and 1. Too tight a balance between EPSPs and IPSPs will cause the model to produce a CV outside the interval considered to correspond to the physiological range. Going to the extreme, an exact balance between EPSPs and IPSPs as considered in [24] ensures a long-tailed ISI output distribution for which the moments such as mean and variance cannot be defined. In this case it is meaningless to consider quantities like output jitter, CV, etc. of the efferent ISIs. The longer the tail of the input inter-arrival time distribution, the less is the requirement for balance between EPSPs and IPSPs in order to evoke output spike trains with a CV between 0. 5 and 1. For a given short-tailed input distribution, the range of values of r in which the CV of efferent ISIs is between 0. 5 and 1 is almost completely inside the range in which output jitter (standard deviation of efferent ISI) is greater than <b>input</b> <b>jitter.</b> Only when the CV is smaller than 0. 5 or the input distribution is a long-tailed one is output less than <b>input</b> <b>jitter</b> [21]. The I&F model tends to enlarge low <b>input</b> <b>jitter</b> and reduce high <b>input</b> <b>jitter.</b> We also provide a novel theoretical framework, based upon extreme value theory in statistics, for estimating output jitter, CV and mean firing time...|$|E

40|$|The {{firing rate}} of neocortical {{pyramidal}} neurons {{is believed to}} represent primarily the average arrival rate of synaptic inputs; however, {{it has also been}} found to vary somewhat depending on the degree of synchrony among synaptic inputs. We investigated the ability of pyramidal neurons to perform coincidence detection, that is, to represent input timing in their firing rate, and explored some factors that influence that representation. We injected computer-generated simulated synaptic inputs into pyramidal neurons during whole-cell recordings, systematically altering the phase delay between two groups of periodic simulated input events. We explored how input intensity, the synaptic time course, inhibitory synaptic conductance, and <b>input</b> <b>jitter</b> influenced the firing rate representation of input timing. In agreement with computer modeling studies, we found that input synchronization increases firing rate when intensity is low but reduces firing rate when intensity is high. At high intensity, the effect of synchrony on firing rate could be switched from reducing to increasing firing rate by shortening the simulated excitatory synaptic time course, adding inhibition (using the dynamic clamp tech-nique), or introducing a small <b>input</b> <b>jitter.</b> These opposite effects of synchrony may serve different computational functions: as a means of increasing firing rate it may be useful for efficient recruitment or for computing a continuous parameter, whereas as a means of decreasing firing rate it may provide gain control, which would allow redundant or excessive input to be ignored.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{development}} of the first 60 GHz-standard compatible fully integrated 4 -channel phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer has been presented. The frequency synthesizer features third-order single loop architecture with completely integrated passive loop filter that does not require any additional external passive component. Two possible realizations of fully integrated clock and data recovery (CDR) circuits suitable for 60 GHz-standard compliant base band signal processing have been presented {{for the first time as}} well. The two CDRs have been optimized for either high data rate (3. 456 Gb/s) or very low power consumption (5 mW) and they both work with a single 1 V supply. The frequency synthesizer is intended to generate a variable LO frequency in a fixed-IF heterodyne transceiver architecture. In such configuration the channel selection is implemented by changing the LO frequency by the required frequency step. This method avoids quadrature 50 GHz up/down-conversion thereby lowering the LO mixer design complexity and simplifying the LO distribution network. The measurement results show the PLL locking correctly on each of the four channels while consuming 60 mW from a 1 V power supply. The worst case phase noise is measured to be - 80. 1 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from the highest frequency carrier (56. 16 GHz). The output spectrum shows a reference spur attenuation of - 32 dBc. The high data rate CDR features a maximum operating data rate in excess of 3. 456 Gb/s while consuming 30 mW of power. The low power CDR consumes only 5 mW and operates at a maximum data rate of 1. 728 Gb/s. Over a 1. 5 m 60 GHz wireless link, both CDRs allow 95 % reduction of the pulse shaping generated <b>input</b> peak-to-peak <b>jitter</b> from 450 ps down to 50 ps. Ph. D.

Each link offers its packet transmission slots to its user sessions by polling them in round-robin order. In addition, window flow control {{is used to}} prevent excessive packet queues at the network nodes. As the window size in-creases, the session throughput rates are shown to approach limits that are perfectly fair in the max-min sense. That is, the smallest session rate in the network is as large as possible and, subject to that constraint, the second-smallest session rate is as large as possible, etc. If each session has periodic <b>input</b> (per-haps with <b>jitter)</b> or has such heavy demand that packets are always waiting to enter the network, then a finite window size suffices to produce perfectly fair throughput rates. The round-robin method is considerably simpler than earlier strategies for achieving global fairness. The fair session rates are not explicitly computed, and the only overhead communi-cation is that required for the window acknowledgments. The main drawback is that large windows are needed to achieve even approximately fair throughputs in some (hopefully rare) situations, and large windows permit large crossnetwork de-lays. Fortunately, the round-robin method offers other throughput guarantees that, while falling short of perfect fair-ness, do apply even for sessions with small windows. Such ses-sions are promised reasonable bounds on their crossnetwork packet delay as well...|$|R
