40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the vernacular architecture and human settlement of Orchid Island. It attempts to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uencing factors of architectural composition and {{the arrangement of}} villages regarding their environmen-tal conditions. Orchid Island is mostly populated by an aboriginal people called the Tao. Six tribes totaling 3000 people live on the island, coexisting among different cultures and traditions. The subterranean clustered build-ings are the most particular confi guration of the island. These constructs demonstrate a conspicuous vernacular fi gure, refl ecting {{a high level of}} effi ciency and practicality, which corresponds with the local environment and the landscape of the island. Although the settlement space and the island’s land use change gradually due to various socio-economic factors, the traditional subterranean buildings survive; they are conserved and used primarily by two tribes called the Langdau and Yehyin. Although both tribes reside on this small island, some distinct physical differences in the buildings they use can be recognized. The goal of this research is to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uencing factors by comparing representative examples from each tribe. The study of the research con-sists of (i) a fi eld investigation on the confi guration of buildings and the physical difference between two tribes and (ii) a correlation analysis on the settlement arrangement and the composition of traditional buildings with their environmental conditions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} reestablishment of the Hammanskraal train station, by providing an integrated transport node {{that includes a}} variety of community functions. The aim is to re-introduce the Stationarea as a signifi cant trade and transport node in the Hammanskraal community. The main routes linking to the railway station and the surrounding urban fabric are re-evaluated and altered to accommodate not only the railway programme, but also to better suit the growing needs of the community. Theoretically <b>the</b> project <b>explores</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence architecture and spatial perceptions have on the social behaviour and the interactions between diff erent users in these spaces. These relationships are explored to create architecture that not only responds to existing conditions but also becomes a landmark {{in the area and}} a reference for future developments in the area. The theoretical investigation can be applied in a design such as the new Hammanskraal station as the characteristics and scope of this node need to integrate diff erent users and functions. Integrating these aspects into the design leads to new forms of interaction and spatial appropriation. The closure of the public component of the railway station resulted in the degradation and neglect of a site that is located within one of the busiest social and commercial nodes of the Hammanskraal Township. The suspended long distance commuter service in favour of the taxi and bus service has resulted in the lack of transport options to thousands of daily commuters between the township and the Pretoria CBD. The new Hammanskraal Railway interchange aims to reconnect the local residents, with a more economic means of travel, to the Pretoria CBD as most of them commute there for work opportunities. Integration and interaction between rail and road transport and numerous informal traders, within a vibrant urban space, are the main focus areas of the design. The design’s intent is to provide a reconnected township, while addressing the immediate needs of the site and the community. The redesign of the Hammanskraal Station precinct does not only reconnect the township to the railway system, but reintroduces much needed energy and public functions to the township itself while providing new economic opportunities both locally and in the surrounds.

To <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of sociodemographic {{factors on}} access to {{appointments}} with physicians in primary, secondary, and {{tertiary health care}} in a publicly funded health care system. Design. A population-based registry study. Setting. Different health care settings in V ä sternorrland county, Sweden. Subjects. All residents in the county {{at the end of}} 2006. Main outcome measures. The number of people per 1000 residents who had at least one appointment with a physician in an average month in different health care settings. Results. A total of 87 people had appointments with a physician in primary health care, 44 in outpatient clinics at a regional hospital, 20 in an emergency department, 14 in home care, and two in a university hospital outpatient clinic. Twelve were hospitalized at a regional hospital and 1 at the university hos-pital. Being young or elderly, female, divorced, widowed, and having a contractor as usual source of care were all independ-ently associated with higher odds of receiving primary care. Conclusions. The physician ’ s offi ce in primary care is the setting that has the potential to affect the largest number of people. The extent of the use of health care was independently infl u-enced by all sociodemographic characteristics studied, which highlights the importance of individual factors in future resource allocation. Regarding availability the ecology model provides superior information as compared with the absolute number of physicians ’ appointments.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to <b>explore</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of socio-demographic and clinical factors and neurocognitive variables (i. e. prospective and retrospective memory, executive functioning, and intelligence) on social functioning in Chinese schizophrenia patients. Methods: The study sample comprised 110 Chinese schizophrenia patients. Their clinical condition and social functioning were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Functional Needs Assessment (FNA), respectively. Three prospective memory (PM) tasks (time-, event-, and activity-based), three tests of executive functioning (the Design Fluency Test [DFT], Tower of London [TOL], and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST]), one test of intelligence (Raven ' s Progressive Matrices), and two retrospective memory (RM) tasks (the immediate and delayed recall conditions of the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scales-Revised [WMS-R]) were administered to all patients. Results: In correlation analyses higher education and better performance on the WCST (categories completed) and the Logical Memory subtests (delayed and immediate) of the WMS-R are signifi cantly correlated with better social functioning, whereas a lower WCST score (perseverative errors) and more severe negative symptoms are associated with poorer social functioning. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that higher education and a lower WCST score (perseverative errors) independently contribute to better social functioning. Conclusions: Unexpectedly, most socio-demographic and clinical factors do not seem to have a signifi cant impact on social functioning of Chinese schizophrenia patients living in a Chinese society. Negative symptoms and certain cognitive defi cits were the main predictors of social functioning and they should be the main targets for antipsychotic treatment and psychosocial interventions to improve social adjustment in Chinese schizophrenia patients.

40|$|The {{career choice}} model of Adya and Kaiser posits the {{availability}} of technology resources as a structural element impacting on career choice. The model distinguishes between accessibility at school and at home. Based on this theoretical point of departure and by arguing a link between choice of major and choice of fi eld of career, this paper <b>explores</b> specifi cally <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of <b>the</b> access of internet at school and at home on perceptions and values pertaining to the career South African students are preparing for. This exploratory study investigates whether any differences can be found between students who selected computing majors at tertiary level and students who selected non-computing majors. Internet availability in South Africa is potentially interesting, as it constitutes not simply an ‘available technology’, but may be an indicator of aspects such as technology skills, information resources, educational quality and socio-economic conditions. A quantitative {{study was conducted with}} 1741 students as participants from three different departments in the School of IT at a university in South Africa. Students participated in a survey early in the academic year. The fi ndings show that lack of internet access homogenises students’ career perceptions across the groups of majors. However, where students have internet access the views on career choices differ considerably between computing-majors and non-computing majors particularly in terms of views on the nature of work opportunities and of personal qualities of IT people. Also, a pronounced difference emerges in the perceptions of non-computing majors with and without internet access centering around views about the importance of sources of career information and around self-effi cacy in the chosen career. Most importantly, the computing majors group is fairly homogeneous in terms of their perceptions regarding computer-related careers regardless of internet access. Since similarities shared by these students evidently cannot be ascribed to internet access or even to the socio-economic and educational factors that make internet access possible, this research indicates that <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of <b>the</b> internet on perceptions of career and consequently on career choice is complex with more diverse linkages to psychosocial factors than posited by the model of Adya and Kaiser.

40|$|Diastolic {{heart failure}} (DHF) with normal {{systolic}} pump function has been typically {{observed in the}} majority of HF patients. DHF changes regular diastolic behaviour of left-ventricle (LV), and increases the ventricular wall stress. Therefore, normalisation of increased LV wall stress is the cornerstone of many existing and new therapeutic treatments. However, information regarding such regional stress-strain distribution for human LV is extremely limited in the literature. Thus, the study aimed at estimating the normal range and regional variation of diastolic stress-strain field in healthy human LVs, and <b>exploring</b> <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of fibre structure, geometrical heterogeneity and material properties on passive infl ation of LV. It is envisaged that such information could be used as targets for future in-silico studies to design optimised HF treatments. FE modelling of passive diastolic mechanics was carried out using personalised ventricular geometry, that was constructed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and structure-based orthotropic constitutive law. Laplace-Dirichlet-Region growing-Finite element (LDRF) algorithm was developed in order to assign the myocardium fibre map on ventricular geometry. The effect of right ventricle (RV) deformation, that has not been taken into account by the majority of researchers due to modelling simplification, was investigated for the first time by comparing the results predicted by bi-ventricle (BV) and single LV models, constructed from the aforementioned MRI data. In addition, personalised in-vivo measurement of fibre structure, that might be different in individual subjects and diseased conditions, is still an open question. Therefore, the sensitivity of LV diastolic mechanics to the details of the fibre structure was accomplished for the first time using eight different fibre orientations. In-vivo passive orthotropic myocardium properties for healthy human myocardium, indispensable for personalised LV wall stress estimation, was identified, and subsequently, the regional variations of LV wall stress-strain were investigated by incorporating geometrical heterogeneity, personalised myocardium properties and LV base movements in the FE models. RV deformation increased average fibre and sheet stress-strain in LV wall during diastole, and therefore, the effect should always be included in cardiac biomechanics study. Any pathological remodelling, that increased the amount of transmural fibre angle, led to an additional LV <b>infl</b> ation. <b>The</b> study indicates that a change in fibre orientation may contribute to the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) development. Future therapeutic intervention should consider the effect of altered fibre orientation for better outcome. Due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse optimisation problem, the average myocardial stiffness was extracted by identifying the normal ranges of the parameters. A novel method was developed by combining FE modelling, response surface method (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) to identify the passive orthotropic myocardium properties for healthy human myocardium using routinely used clinical data. These myocardium properties can directly be utilised in future computational studies. Although the regional stress-strain distribution of the LV wall was highly heterogeneous amongst the individuals, it was observed that the inner wall of the LV experienced higher fibre stress compared to the outer wall. The LV wall near the base and the lateral region received greater stress-strain compared to the other regions. The incorporation of LV base movement (not addressed in the literature) improved the FE model predictions, and therefore, it is recommended to be considered in later studies. In addition, normal ranges of various stress-strain components in different regions of LV wall were reported for five healthy human ventricles considering RV deformation, LV base movement, and subject-specific myocardium properties. This information {{could be used as a}} reference map for future studies. The study revealed that the FE modelling can be employed to analyse the effect of geometry, fibre-structure and material properties on normal ventricular mechanics, and therefore, can provide a greater insight into the underlying mechanics of failing heart and plan for optimised surgical intervention. Hence, the research has impacts on computational cardiac biomechanics as well as clinical cardiac physiology fields...|$|R

40|$|Human {{perception}} of faces {{is widely believed}} to rely on automatic processing by a domain-specifi c, modular component of the visual system. Scalp-recorded event-related potential (ERP) recordings indicate that faces receive special stimulus processing at around 170 ms poststimulus onset, in that faces evoke an enhanced occipital negative wave, known as the N 170, relative to the activity elicited by other visual objects. As predicted by modular accounts of face processing, this early face-specifi c N 170 enhancement {{has been reported to}} be largely immune to <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of endogenous processes such as task strategy or attention. However, most studies examining <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of attention on face processing have focused on non-spatial attention, such as object-based attention, which tend to have longer-latency effects. In contrast, numerous studies have demonstrated that visual spatial attention can modulate the processing of visual stimuli as early as 80 ms poststimulus &# 8211; substantially earlier than the N 170. These temporal characteristics raise the question of whether this initial face-specifi c processing is immune to <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of spatial attention. This question was addressed in a dual-visualstream ERP study in which <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of spatial attention on the face-specifi c N 170 could be directly examined. As expected, early visual sensory responses to all stimuli presented in an attended location were larger than responses evoked by those same stimuli when presented in an unattended location. More importantly, a signifi cant face-specifi c N 170 effect was elicited by faces that appeared in an attended location, but not in an unattended one. In summary, early face-specifi c processing is not automatic, but rather, like other objects, strongly depends on endogenous factors such as the allocation of spatial attention. Moreover, these fi ndings underscore <b>the</b> extensive <b>infl</b> uence that top-down attention exercises over the processing of visual stimuli, including those of high natural salience...|$|R

Methods. Groups of 7 mice were treated with Cobalt Chloride (3. 75 mg/kg body weight), administered intraperitoneal. Diff erent tests were used for evaluating the antinociceptive eff ect or <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence on behavior of the tested substances: thermal nociception (hot plate test, tail fl ick test), chemical nocicep-tion (writhing test) and spontaneous behavior (activity cage assay). Results. Our preliminary data for response latencies for hot-plate and tail-fl ick tests suggest that systemi-cally administered Co produces a signifi cant analgesic eff ect under thermal nociceptive stimulation. Th e spontaneous behavior assay also shows a signifi cant decrease of activity in the tested animals. Discussion. Pain inhibition is even more signifi cant in conditions of chemical nociceptive stimulation, in a model of visceral pain. Conclusion. Th e mechanism through which Co exerts its analgesic eff ect is still unclear, and will require more investigations, including dose-eff ect analysis, {{though it may be}} related to <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of haeme oxygenase- 1 on <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> ammatory pain pathways...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>infl</b> uence of food allergens on the profi le of infl ammatory markers in {{children}} with asthma has not been investigated. To ascertain <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of food allergens on the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> ammatory process, a cytokine profi le was determined before and after a food challenge test in the peripheral blood of children with asthma and coexistent food allergy. Material and methods: We studied 22 children with asthma and immunoglobulin (Ig) E-dependent food allergy. Oral challenge tests were carried out using double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Blood was sampled before, and 4 and 24 hours after the oral challenge test. <b>The</b> <b>infl</b> ammatory markers interleukin (IL) 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, intereron (IFN) -γ, sIL- 2 R, and sCD 23 were evaluated. The level of cytokines in serum was determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay Bender Med Systems (Vienna, Austria). Results: The median IL- 4 level before the challenge test was 23. 5 pg/mL, after 4 hours it was 38. 8 pg/mL, and after 24 hours it was 35. 4 pg/mL. The median IL- 5 levels measured {{at the same time}} points were 4. 6 pg/mL, 5. 7 pg/mL, and 7. 5 pg/mL. A signifi cant increase in IL- 4 and IL- 5 levels 4 hours (P =. 0006; P =. 006) and 24 hours (P =. 014; P =. 015) after food challenge was observed. No statistically signifi cant differences in the levels of the other cytokines during allergen or placebo challenge tests were recorded. Conclusions: Determination of plasma IL- 4 and IL- 5 levels can be a useful tool for evaluation of the effects of food challenge tests on children with asthma and coexisting IgE-dependent food allergy. The results of determining serum IL- 10, TNF-α, interleukin (IL) IFN-γ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of Jansenism, namely through French authors, in Codex 13049 from the National Library of Portugal (BNP). The codex is composed of six parts, three of which are Portuguese translations of the work Défense de lʼÉglise Romaine contre les calomnies des Protestans, by French Jansenist Dom Gabriel Gerberon (1628 - 1711). Protestants (Calvinists) accused the Roman Church of being Pelagian. Dom Gerberon attempts to illustrate the differences between Catholic, Protestant and Pelagian doctrines concerning the mysteries of Predestination and Grace. The work includes a collection of dialogues between Deodatus and Romano that could be seen as a sort of Jansenist Catechism. The Codex also reveals <b>the</b> <b>infl</b> uence of other Jansenist authors such as Vivien de Laborde and Jérome Besoigne...|$|R
40|$|Data {{obtained}} {{during the}} last 20 years from selected hydrographic sta-tions throughout the Arctic Ocean basins and at the continental slopes and northern parts of the surrounding shelf seas are examined to esti-mate the contribution of Atlantic water to {{the upper part of}} the Arctic Ocean water column, and to follow the circulation of the Atlantic derived halocline waters around the Arctic Ocean basins. A substantial frac-tion of the Atlantic water entering the Arctic Ocean in <b>the</b> two <b>infl</b> ow branches, <b>the</b> Fram Strait branch and the Barents Sea branch, is trans-formed into less dense waters. <b>The</b> <b>infl</b> ow through Fram Strait encounters and melts sea ice. Its upper part becomes less saline, and in winter, ice formation homogenizes this low salinity upper part into a winter mixed layer, which follows the boundary fl ow eastward. <b>The</b> <b>infl</b> ow over <b>the</b> Barents Sea mainly becomes colder, less saline and denser due to cooling and net precipitation, but melting of sea ice also here creates a less dense upper layer, which is subsequently homogenized by haline convection...|$|R
