The Baltimore Sun extolled Sherwood's distinguished half-century {{of service to the}} steamer line when he retired, noting approvingly that his oft-expressed philosophy was, [...] "Stand up <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> city wherever you may go." [...] (His son, John W. Sherwood, founded Baltimore's celebrated Sherwood Gardens in the mid-1920s.) Sherwood was succeeded by S. Davies Warfield as president (1918â€“1927).|$|E
500|$|Billings met Louis Saekow {{through a}} string of friends but was {{hesitant}} to hire him. Inspired by Avalon Hill's games, Billings wanted SSI's games to look professional and include maps, detailed manuals, and excellent box art. Two months prior, Saekow had postponed medical school to pursue his {{dream of becoming a}} graphic designer. To secure the job, Saekow told Billings that he could withhold pay if the work was unsatisfactory. In creating the box art, Saekow used a stat camera; his roommate worked for a magazine company and helped him sneak in to use its camera after hours. Saekow's cousin then handled printing the packaging. Without any storage for the complete products, Billings stored the first [...] in his bedroom. In February 1980, he distributed [...] to [...] owners, and displayed the game at the Applefest exposition a month later. SSI purchased a full-page advertisement in the March 1980 BYTE which stated [...] "Now there's a true historical wargame <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>home</b> computer ... There's never been anything like it". It mentioned the ability to play against the computer or another person, and save a game in progress. The [...] version was $59.95, and the advertisement promised future support for the TRS-80 and other computers.|$|E

60|$|These, my friends, are {{the holy}} and thankful {{thoughts}} which {{ought to be}} in your hearts every day and hour. This is the thought which God meant to put into your hearts when He made sailors of you, and brought you into the world, by the sea-side, to take up your business in great waters. You might have been born in Bristol or Liverpool or London, and never seen anything but streets and houses, and man's clumsy work. But God has been very good to you. He has brought you up here, in this happy West country, where you may see His wonderful works day and night; where you ought never to forget that you have a Father in heaven who made the sea, and who keeps you safe at sea by night and day. God has given you a great deal. He has given you two books to read--the book of God's Word, the Bible, and the book of God's earth, the sky and sea and land, which is above you and below you and around you day and night. If you can read and understand them properly, you will find in them everything which you want; you may learn from them to be holy in this world and happy in the next. God has given you, too, fathers, mothers, wives, children, a comfortable home, a holy trade--the same which the apostles followed. God has given you England for your country, and the West country--the best place in England <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>home.</b> God has given you a good Queen, and good magistrates and landlords. God has given you health and strength, and seamanship, and clear heads and stout hearts. And God has made you seamen and fishermen, and given you a business in which you can see God's mighty power and wisdom day and night, and feel Him taking care of you when you cannot take care of yourselves.|$|E
