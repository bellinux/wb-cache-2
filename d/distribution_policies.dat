40|$|The {{system for}} the {{production}} and distribution of the United States supply of influenza vaccine has experienced disruptions during past influenza seasons. The identification of elements of the influenza vaccine is different each year and must be researched and identified each year prior to the influenza season. The manufacturing of the vaccine is a complicated process with many potential problems. This thesis identifies the requirements and constraints of the current manufacturing and distribution system including the annual demand and supply. This information is used to create an illustrative model based on operational research and operational management theory to develop a systematic approach to distribution of the influenza vaccine in a shortage situation. Two different policies are identified {{for use in a}} normal influenza season to determine how many companies are required to provide a sufficient amount of influenza vaccine with the understanding that some of the companies might have manufacturing difficulties. These two policies are the percentage <b>distribution</b> <b>policy</b> and the strict priority <b>distribution</b> <b>policy.</b> The model includes a determination of the number of companies that should be available for influenza vaccine production and the amount of vaccine that should be ordered from each company to minimize the total cost. The majority of the influenza seasons could be covered by purchasing fewer than 108 million doses, as in the percentage <b>distribution</b> <b>policy,</b> making sure that the vaccine dose orders are spread out evenly over four companies and distributed evenly by age group percentage, but could be reduced to as little as 24. 5 million total vaccine doses if necessary with minimal cost and loss of life using a strict priority <b>distribution</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} interconnectivity, {{adaptivity}} and flexibility are leading to distributed component-based systems (DCBS) where components may dynamically join {{and leave a}} system at run-time. Our research is aimed at {{the development of an}} architecture for middleware for DCBS such that the extra-functional properties of resulting systems can be easily tailored to different requirements. To this end, we proposed an architecture based on the shared data space paradigm. This architecture provides a suite of distribution strategies [16] supporting different application usage patterns. We showed that using different distribution strategies for different usage patterns improved overall performance [17]. As is the case with other middleware for DCBS, the configuration of the selected <b>distribution</b> <b>policies</b> was fixed before run-time. Consequently, these systems cannot adapt to changes in usage patterns that {{may be due to the}} joining of leaving of the components in the system. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for the dynamic adaptation of <b>distribution</b> <b>policies</b> to the evolving behaviour of applications. This architecture improves over existing architectures for distributed shared data spaces by providing a mechanism for self-management. We experimentally demonstrate the benefits that may be gained by dynamic adaptation of <b>distribution</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|E
