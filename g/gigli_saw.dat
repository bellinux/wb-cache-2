50|$|A <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> is a {{flexible}} wire saw used by surgeons for bone cutting. A <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> is used mainly for amputation, where the bones {{have to be}} smoothly cut {{at the level of}} amputation.|$|E

5000|$|For under {{eight months}} of age, but after the horns are {{starting}} to grow attached to the skull, so a cup dehorner or a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw,</b> a type of surgical cutting wire, is used. There are several different types of cup dehorners, but they all serve the same function of removing the horn and growth ring. Since the horn is tougher it takes more force to remove it so tools that provide some leverage are need. <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> wire is used on horns of older calf’s horns that have grown too large for the cup dehorners.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gigli</b> <b>saws</b> were {{sometimes}} {{hidden in the}} clothing of British secret agents during World War II.|$|R
50|$|Initially Fraser-Smith {{supplied}} {{clothing and}} standard props (from second-hand sources) for SOE agents working behind enemy lines, but SOE directives and his taste for gadgetry {{led him to}} develop {{a wide range of}} spy and escape devices, including miniature cameras inside cigarette lighters, shaving brushes containing film, hairbrushes containing a map and saw, pens containing hidden compasses, steel shoelaces that doubled as garrottes or <b>gigli</b> <b>saws,</b> an asbestos-lined pipe for carrying secret documents, and much more.|$|R
40|$|The fronto-orbito {{zygomatic}} {{approach is}} part of the surgical armamentarium of modern skull base surgery. As described in the literature, it requires costly technological tools such as powerful drills and saws, to be performed. In the present communication we describe a technical modification that allows the zygoma to be elevated "en bloc" together with the fronto-orbital bone flap by means of appropriate use of the <b>Gigli's</b> <b>saw.</b> Using this technique, adequate replacement of the craniotomy flap requires only two silk sutures. This technical modification, which was already successfully used in over 20 cases, would also allow this useful approach to be performed in those neurosurgical environments where modern costly technology for cranial base surgery is not available...|$|R
50|$|Although Gigli's operation, {{the lateral}} pubiotomy, is rarely {{performed}} today, the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> is still used to perform amputations and cranial flaps, and to section the sternum when performing an emergency clamshell thoracotomy.|$|E
5000|$|Leonardo Gigli (30 April 1863, Sesto Fiorentino [...] - [...] 4 April 1908, Florence) was an Italian {{surgeon and}} {{obstetrician}} remembered for describing Gigli's operation, and for designing the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> to simplify its performance.|$|E
5000|$|Unpowered - Unpowered bone cutting {{implements}} include {{varieties of}} hacksaw and sabre saw. In many applications, the saw {{is used in}} specialised jigs to provide accurate, measurable cuts, e.g. in knee surgery. Specialized saws such as the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw,</b> a cable made of sharp strands of wire, are also used in some procedures.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} technical maneuvers used to complete minimally invasive resections of the chest wall successfully. MethodsCase videos of advanced thoracoscopic chest wall resections performed at a comprehensive cancer center were reviewed, as were published reports. These were analyzed for similarities and also categorized to summarize alternative approaches. ResultsLimited chest wall resections en bloc with lobectomy can be accomplished with port placement {{similar to that used}} for typical thoracoscopic anatomic resections, particularly when the utility incision is close to the region of excision. Generally, chest wall resection precedes lobectomy. Ribs can be transected with <b>Gigli</b> <b>saws,</b> endoscopic shears, or high-speed drills. Division of bone and overlying soft tissue can be planned precisely using thoracoscopic guidance. Isolated primary chest wall masses may require different port position and selective reconstruction using synthetic materials. Patch anchoring can be accomplished by devices that facilitate laparoscopic port site fascial closure. ConclusionsThoracoscopic chest wall resections have been accomplished safely using tools and maneuvers summarized here. Further outcomes research is necessary to identify the benefits of thoracoscopic chest wall resection over an open approach...|$|R
50|$|According to {{a recent}} episode of What History Forgot on the American Heroes Network, <b>Gigli</b> <b>saws</b> also were sent to British POWs held by the Germans, in a little known escape scheme. A British company {{licensed}} to produce London versions of the board game Monopoly by Parker Brothers, the manufacturer, worked closely with Military Intelligence to hide saws and other tools, money, and maps inside the double-thick boards. Apparently, every RAF air squadron had officers trained in escape. When they were captured, they knew where to write to announce that they were now prisoners-of-war, and where they were being held. In return, these officers would be sent one of the special Monopoly games, via the International Red Cross care package. When the escape-trained officer opened it {{and saw that the}} board had a dot on the parking square, he knew {{to take it to the}} most private place he could find and open it to access its contents. Should the officer and the others he chose to escape with him be successful, neither they, nor other POWs he may have passed the tools onto knew where the saw, file, money and maps came from.|$|R
40|$|Acupuncture {{can affect}} bone healing by {{stimulation}} of sensory nerves and releasing {{of local and}} systemic neuropeptides. The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture on ulna fracture healing in dogs. In this study, 12 healthy dogs were randomly divided in to four equal groups, where group 1 was kept as control group and evaluated for 45 days, group 2 : treatment group and evaluated for 45 days, group 3 : control group of 90 days and group 4 : treatment group of 90 days. After induction of anesthesia, the ulna was cut with <b>Gigli</b> wire <b>saw</b> in each groups, 10 days after operation, the treatment (acupuncture) group was treated with 10 minutes electroacupuncture stimulations on the acupoints Kid 1, Kid 3, Kid 6 and Kid 7, for 10 days. Histopathologic samples of all dogs were harvested from bone osteotomized site in 45 and 90 days after surgery. Indices like, count of inflammatory cells, cartilaginous tissue, fibrotic tissue and deposition of collagen were evaluated on samples and classified with 0, 1, 2, and 3 degrees. Also, radiographic evaluation of the patients was applied using radiographic scoring system on days: 7, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 after surgery. This study revealed that, acupuncture {{had no effect on}} bone healing (p> 0. 05). Cause of non-significant difference changes between the control and treatment groups, and lack of complete healing in both groups may be due to lack of ulna bone fixation. Alternatively, selection of other acupoints in acupuncture could have a better healing role...|$|R
50|$|When Chiara died in 1891 Gigli left Italy, {{travelling}} to Paris to {{work under}} Tarnier, then to London and Wrocław where he worked under Professor Henry Fritsch from November 1892 to June 1893. During his time in Wrocław who knewhe was also able to attend surgery with Mikulicz; here he first designed the wire saw which was manufactured by the Haertel company. He wrote {{about the use of}} this saw, which became known as the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw,</b> to perform lateral pubiotomy (Gigli's operation) to assist in obstructed labour in July 1893 and again in October 1894 in the Annals of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Milan.|$|E
50|$|The first {{craniotome}} {{was designed}} and created by John H. Bent, a mechanical engineer and owner of Standard Pneumatic Motor Company, under contract with Hall Air Instruments of Santa Barbara, California. When Hall was subsequently acquired by 3M Company (which was then actively developing and marketing surgical instruments), the 3M Craniotome became widely used in neurosurgery, replacing the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> (manually pulled saw wires) as the primary means of opening the skull {{for access to the}} brain for surgical procedures. Bent designed the original Craniotome around a small, lightweight, very high speed (approximately 70,000 rpm) pneumatic turbine motor he had invented for use in industrial wire-wrapping tools and other air-powered hand-held devices.|$|E
30|$|This {{corticotomy}} {{technique has}} been adapted by various authors, notably De Bastiani [2] and Patkiss and Gross [3] who described the ‘Afghan Percutaneous Osteotomy’ using a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b> The De Bastiani technique purports {{to keep the}} medullary blood supply intact; the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> technique divides it. On the other hand, the usual approach for the De Bastiani corticotomy is an anterior incision over the tibial crest, whereas the incisions to pass a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> tend to be smaller but require more periosteal elevation.|$|E
50|$|The origin is debated, but a chainsaw-like tool {{was made}} around 1830 by the German {{orthopaedist}} Bernhard Heine. This instrument, the osteotome, had links {{of a chain}} carrying small cutting teeth with the edges set at an angle; the chain was moved around a guiding blade by turning the handle of a sprocket wheel. As the name implies, this was used to cut bone.The prototype of the chain saw familiar today in the timber industry was pioneered in the late 18th century by two Scottish doctors, John Aitken and James Jeffray, for symphysiotomy and excision of diseased bone respectively. The chain hand saw, a fine serrated link chain which cut on the concave side, was invented around 1783-1785. It was illustrated in Aitken's Principles of Midwifery or Puerperal Medicine (1785) and used by him in his dissecting room. Jeffray claimed to have conceived {{the idea of the}} chain saw independently about that time but it was 1790 before he was able to have it produced. In 1806, Jeffray published Cases of the Excision of Carious Joints by H. Park and P. F. Moreau with Observations by James Jeffray M.D. In this communication he translated Moreau's paper of 1803. Park and Moreau described successful excision of diseased joints, particularly the knee and elbow. Jeffray explained that the chain saw would allow a smaller wound and protect the adjacent neurovascular bundle. While a heroic concept, symphysiotomy had too many complications for most obstetricians but Jeffray's ideas became accepted, especially after the development of anaesthetics. Mechanised versions of the chain saw were developed but in the later 19th Century, it was superseded in surgery by the <b>Gigli</b> twisted wire <b>saw.</b> For much of the 19th century, however, the chain saw was a useful surgical instrument.|$|R
30|$|New bone {{formation}} is more rapid {{with the original}} corticotomy and multiple drill hole osteotomy than the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw,</b> so long that the latency period between {{the day of the}} osteotomy and the day of lengthening is the same. In the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> osteotomy, if the latency period is longer than 15  days the new {{bone formation}} is more evident and homogenous [40].|$|E
30|$|There are {{numerous}} other advantages for the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> technique, including {{that there is}} no need to disassemble the frame and hence can be performed with minimal interruption of the circular frame. This method creates a very neat fracture line, confirming the definitive completion of the osteotomy, once through the cortex. The risks associated with the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> could be an injury as a result of cutting soft tissues around the bone. Consequently, this led to the design and production of similar alternative methods being created such as the Threadwire saw [43].|$|E
30|$|This {{was carried}} out with the “crown” {{technique}} in 45 cases and with a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> in 55 cases without {{significant differences in the}} quality of the newly formed bone.|$|E
30|$|All {{proximal}} tibial osteotomies {{were done}} either by <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> or by osteotome percutaneously. A previous study showed {{no difference in}} healing of proximal tibial metaphyseal osteotomies using either technique [7].|$|E
40|$|In I 894 Leonard Gigli {{described}} a simple device for cutting bones. The instru-ment {{consisted of a}} single steel wire, the surface {{of which had been}} roughened, and two handles which were attached {{to the ends of the}} wire allowing to-and-fro move-ments. Since that time, the apparatus has been modified, using braided wires with corrugations and has become known as the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b> Because of its simplicity and reliability, the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> has become very popular as a bone-cutting instrument. The main difficulty in its use is in passing the device around the bone which is to be cut. At least two instruments have been designed to help effect this passage 2, 3 We have modified a stethoscope earpiece in such a way as to make a very suit-able guide for passage of the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> (Fig. 1). A transverse bar is welded onto the end of the single earpiece of the stethoscope to allow control of the apparatus. A semisharp trocar is machined to screw on the tip of the earpiece to allow passage through soft tissue. After passage is accomplished, the trocar is removed. The <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> is then inserted through the guide, and the guide is removed. This permits divi-sion of the bone from within outwards under full control. FIG. 1 Modified stethoscope earpiece with a transverse bar welded on the end and a removable semi-sharp trocar on the other end...|$|E
30|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} studies examining the factors influencing regenerate formation {{have been described}} [6, 7]. These include the site, {{the age of the}} patient and the amount of distraction applied. In a canine model, tibial osteotomies made with a mallet and hammer, drill holes and an osteotome, or an oscillating saw were compared. In this study, fewer bone divisions made using the oscillating saw were consolidated at 10  weeks [8]. In a direct comparison in 41 patients between a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> Afghan osteotomy and an osteotomy made with drill holes and an osteotome, the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> method was found to result in a shorter healing index [9]. The authors concluded the Gigli saw-type osteotomy caused less periosteal disruption.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the small}} number of {{patients}} that fit the inclusion criteria for this study, the reproducibility of the technique could not be tested. However, compared to hammering on the curved osteotome, which could cause an intra-articular fracture, the pulling force applied to the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> cannot cause this potentially disastrous complication.|$|E
30|$|This {{technique}} was then advanced and performed percutaneously. Performing this osteotomy method is less technically demanding {{and has an}} easier learning curve than other more complex osteotomy techniques, such as the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> osteotomy. The periosteum can be preserved whilst performing the multiple drill osteotomy, which {{has been shown to}} be integral in gap regeneration during distraction osteogenesis.|$|E
30|$|Two {{transverse}} incisions are {{made and}} via subperiosteal dissection a suture is {{passed from the}} posteromedial to anterolateral using a right-angled and curved clamp. The <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> {{is tied to the}} suture and is pulled from posterior to anterior. Elevators are inserted, and the posterior and lateral cortices divided. The medial periosteum is then elevated, and the cortex divided. The saw is cut with a wire cutter and removed.|$|E
30|$|No {{intraoperative}} complications {{were caused}} by insertion of the pins or use of the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b> No compartment syndrome occurred in association with tibial osteotomy. In both groups, pain {{was the most common}} complaint during the distraction period, particularly in patients requiring lengthening in excess of 4  cm. Pain was relieved by orally administered analgesics. The most frequently occurring complication in our study was pin tract infection, which occurred in 31 patients in both groups (56  %).|$|E
30|$|We {{know from}} Ilizarov’s {{experience}} the problems encountered with the classical open osteotomy using Power saws, {{such as the}} oscillating saw, which causes thermal necrosis of bone tissue. Frierson also confirmed that when the power saw is used to perform the osteotomy for distraction osteogenesis, there is decreased bridging vessels and radiographically wider lucent centres throughout the distraction period. The <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> technique and the Drill and Osteotome osteotomy both preserve the periosteal blood supply. They are minimally invasive and are low-energy procedures [52].|$|E
30|$|<b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> {{osteotomy}} is a low-energy osteotomy {{that leaves}} a very smooth cut, which {{is especially important}} for rotational correction [42]. Another advantage of this method is that the surgeon can first perform an incomplete osteotomy, and then complete it after the application of the external fixation device. This is of benefit as it is easier to apply a fixator to a stable bone. The last few millimetres are cut {{at the end of the}} operation. Moreover, this can be done completely percutaneously and subperiosteally producing a precise osteotomy.|$|E
30|$|Several {{low-energy}} osteotomy {{techniques are}} described in the literature, but there is limited evidence comparing them. Our study evaluates the patterns of regenerate formation using two different osteotomy techniques. Two cohorts of patients underwent osteotomy of the tibia using a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> (n =  15) or De Bastiani corticotomy (n =  12) technique. The patient radiographs were assessed by the two senior authors who were blinded to the osteotomy type. Regenerate quality was assessed along the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral cortices, graded 1 – 5 from absent to full consolidation over time. The time to 3 cortices healed/regenerate length was calculated. The time to consolidation of the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral cortices was compared. The mean 3 cortices index in the Gigli group was 2.0  months/cm and in the De Bastiani group 1.8  months/cm. This {{was not a significant}} difference. In both groups, anterior bone formation was slower, and anterior cortical deficiency with a scalloped appearance was seen in 25  % of cases overall with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Both <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> and De Bastiani corticotomy techniques result in good bone formation following distraction osteogenesis. The anterior tibial cortex consolidates more slowly than the other cortices in both groups. This is likely due to deficient soft tissue cover and direct periosteal damage at time of osteotomy.|$|E
30|$|Osteotomy {{techniques}} {{date back}} to Hippocrates circa 415 BC (Jones Hippocrates collected works I, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2006; Brorson in Clin Orthop Relat Res 467 (7): 1907 – 1914, 2009). There is debate about {{the best way to}} divide the bone surgically and which technique yields the best bone regenerate in lengthening; ensuring predictable new bone formation and healing of the osteotomy are the primary goals. We review the history and techniques of the osteotomy and consider the evidence for optimum bone formation. Methods discussed include variants of the ‘drill and osteotome’ technique, use of the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> and use of a power saw. Differences in bone formation through the different techniques are covered.|$|E
30|$|In the tibia, the {{assembly}} comprised of 5 rings: 2 proximal rings, 1 for transport and 2 distal. Two Kirschner wires were inserted and tensioned {{for each of}} the proximal and distal rings; 2 screws coated with hydroxyapatite were applied to the ring used for transport (on the medial subcutaneous surface for the tibia and laterally for the femur) in order to reduce skin problems from the crossed wires. In the femur, a mixed assembly with arches and proximal screws was used with 1 ring for transport and 2 distally. The osteotomy was performed with a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> [11] after the fixator was applied. Bone transport was commenced 5  days after osteotomy at an average rate of 1 / 3  mm every 8  h.|$|E
30|$|The focal dome {{osteotomy}} is an osteotomy {{created with}} {{the centre of}} the dome coincident to the CORA (centre of rotation angulation) derived from deformity calculations. The concavity of the dome faces proximally and the osteotomy creates a large bone interface. Incisions can be performed midline longitudinal or percutaneously. The division is through a percutaneous osteotomy or with a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b> A fibular osteotomy and fixation of the tibia with an external fixator is usually done. In order to tighten the lateral collateral ligament, a distal transport of the fibula can be performed with the focal dome osteotomy. If, on the other hand, tightening of the medial collateral ligament is needed, the focal dome, open wedge, neutral wedge, open wedge-focal dome or neutral focal dome osteotomies all serve to achieve this [29]. A circular external fixator can be used for fixation in this osteotomy [30]. In the circular fixator technique, the fibular osteotomy is made at the start through a posterolateral incision 10  cm distal to the fibular head. The bone is cut in an oblique fashion in order to enable the translation in the coronal plane. Two tensioned wires and a half pin are used for the proximal ring; two tensioned wires and a half pin are applied to the distal upper ring which is positioned perpendicularly to the tibial axis. Two tensioned wires are used for the most distal ring. All wires should not engage the fibula. The tibia is osteotomized just distal to the tibial tubercle with an osteotome or a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b> The lateral and anteromedial cortex are cut with precision with the osteotome. The cutting is completed in the posterior cortex with a turning movement of the osteotome (osteoclasis). The correction is achieved under fluoroscopy with alignment of the two rings [31].|$|E
40|$|A 19 -year-old female patient {{sustained}} a closed spiral midshaft femoral fracture and subsequently underwent femoral intramedullary nail insertion. At followup she complained of difficulty in walking {{and was found}} to have a unilateral in-toeing gait. CT imaging revealed 30 degrees of internal rotation at the fracture site, which had healed. A circumferential osteotomy was performed distal to the united fracture site using a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> with the intramedullary femoral nail in situ. The static distal interlocking screws were removed and the malrotation was corrected. Two further static distal interlocking screws were inserted to secure the intramedullary nail in position. The osteotomy went on to union and her symptoms of pain, walking difficulty, and in-toeing resolved. Our paper is the first to describe a technique for derotation osteotomy following intramedullary malreduction that leaves the intramedullary nail in situ...|$|E
30|$|Two hexapod fixators were used, {{one for the}} femur and one the tibia. Both {{constructs}} {{were constructed}} in advance to reduce surgical procedure time and the frame diameters checked to avoid impingement of soft tissue. The proximal ring of the femoral TSF was fixed with a wire in the anterior third of the frame allowing for sufficient clearance of soft tissue in the posterior part of the thigh. An additional wire was passed at an angle of 45 ° to the first one followed by two Schanz screws to achieve more stability in the construct. The mounting parameters were measured from the proximal frame. The distal ring of the femoral fixator was fixed at an angle approximate to the measured deformity and was, as such, parallel to the aLDFA. The struts were then inserted and the length measurements of the struts noted. Two of the struts were removed temporarily {{to allow for the}} osteotomy of the distal femur performed using a <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
30|$|Our {{approach}} to performing an osteotomy {{is based on}} many factors including previous research, current literature and our own surgical experience, where regenerative properties for each osteotomy and variants of correction are continually considered. On the one hand, ‘Drill and Osteotome’ osteotomy is the most commonly practiced technique, offering adequate regenerative properties and is the most favourable in our experience for performing distraction osteogenesis. In opposition, the <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> yields a clean and organised osteotomy, though the regenerative properties are not as profound. The ‘drill and osteotome’ technique, when performed percutaneously, is our preferred method {{as there is no}} formal exposure of the periosteum. With low speed, cooled drilling and limited drill passes, the risk of adverse thermal necrosis with this method is kept to a minimum. Being able to perform this osteotomy whilst not making any gross changes to the frame construct or the post-operative rehabilitation is also another major advantage of this technique.|$|E
30|$|For {{proximal}} and distal tibial nonunions, {{the constructs}} were {{extended to the}} distal femur or to the foot to increase frame stability. The total residual computer program of the TSF was used to restore the normal limb axis and to achieve lengthening if necessary. A percutaneous <b>Gigli</b> <b>saw</b> osteotomy of the tibia was made through two transverse incisions of the skin in both groups. The latency period before starting distraction osteogenesis was 12 – 14  days. Distraction ranged from 0.5 to 1.5  mm/day, depending on the regenerative quality {{and the number of}} sites of osteotomy. When bone capitation at the docking site was achieved, inter-fragmentary compression was continued at the rate of 0.25  mm/day for 5 – 7  days. Once consolidation had commenced, the rate was 0.25  mm every 2  weeks for more 2  months. Standard pin care with possible showering and application of dry gauze around the pins was recommended [13, 16]. Oral antibiotics were prescribed for patients with pin site infections.|$|E
