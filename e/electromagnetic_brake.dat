In this paper, the basic principle and application of electromagnetic braking technology were briefly introduced first. Then {{the structure of the}} innovative hybrid brake with double disc was put forward. It employed an electromagnetic braking to reduce brake pad wear and braking system thermal recession. Based on the design requirements, the friction brake and the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>brake</b> were designed respectively. Finally, in order to verify that whether the designed hybrid brake meets the design requirements, a bench test was carried out. The electromagnetic braking torque characteristic was tested.
