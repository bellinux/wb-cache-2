5000|$|The {{skyscraper}} is {{a commercial}} office building, rising 298.35 m (979 ft) and has 69 storeys [...] plus {{two levels of}} basement. There is a sky lobby on the 37th and 38th floors. In addition, there are 28 high-speed <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts,</b> six high-speed shuttle lifts between Main (G - 1/F) and Sky (37 - 38/F) lobbies, one <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> between the main lobby and basement carpark and two service lifts.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has 11 <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> and one <b>goods</b> lift, {{as well as}} firefighting lifts and vehicle shuttle lifts.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> but no escalators. The {{platforms}} {{can also be}} reached via the 79-step staircase.|$|R
50|$|Sample {{rooms were}} {{provided}} in the hotel, and stabling accommodation was available. The main staircase of the hotel was designed to enable the subsequent installation of a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift,</b> however {{there is no evidence}} to indicate that this ever occurred. The article also indicated that the walls of the hotel had been built of such a thickness that two additional stories could be added at any time which indicates a possible reason for the provision for a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{included}} {{the introduction of}} a new four court sports hall, an open plan breakout space and a new <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> and staircase.|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> {{between the}} {{platform}} and the concourse opened, followed later by a lift between the concourse and street level.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, a {{car park}} {{extension}} has been added with 100 car spaces, and a new footbridge is being added, with provision for <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There are 29 {{double-deck}} passenger elevators, {{but there}} are different sets that service certain floors of the towers, specifically two sets of six of these double-deck passenger elevators to floors 1–23 and 1–37 respectively. [...] Another set of 5 <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> transport <b>passengers</b> to the 41st and 42nd floors where they can switch lifts to reach the upper zones of the buildings, each double-deck <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> with the capacity of 52 passengers or, 26 passengers per deck. There are also 6 heavy-duty elevators for utility.|$|R
50|$|During January and February 2016, Loch Portain {{was fitted}} with a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> and 2 MES {{evacuation}} systems, 1 port and 1 starboard, whilst dry docking in Birkenhead.|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} the {{technique}} of the mathematical description and researches of the two- speed asynchronous electric drive for the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> of a traditional design is offered. The mathematical model is presented and its elements are described. The {{attention is paid to}} nonlinearities of the two-speed asynchronous electric drive and to detailed analysis of its energetic indices. The results of research of electromechanical transformation in the mechanism of the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> with the two - speed asynchronous motor by a method of mathematical modeling are submitted. At researches are taken into account: variable parameters of an equivalent circuit of the asynchronous motor at work on high and low speeds, variable value of а worm gear reducer efficiency, load of a cabin, direction and real structure of a motion cycle of the lift, which moved under the optimum diagram. The results of modeling are checked up and are confirmed experimentally on the working <b>passenger</b> <b>lift...</b>|$|R
50|$|Engadine station {{opened on}} 1 October 1920. The station was {{extensively}} upgraded in 2006 with {{the provision of}} extended shelters and <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> between the platforms and the overhead footbridge.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} is very intact, and the shopfittings of the ground floor level would seem easily reversible. Notably the finely detailed plaster ceilings, and the timber <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> have survived.|$|R
50|$|The station {{first opened}} in 1858. It {{currently}} has three platforms (two for London-bound services {{and one for}} country-bound services) and a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> from the station entrance to the platforms.|$|R
50|$|From {{the ticket}} hall, three {{escalators}} take passengers {{to and from}} the platforms. There are also <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> between street level, the ticket hall and the platforms to provide step free access.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major easy access upgrade with {{the provision of}} <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> to the platforms, a new passenger concourse, toilets and a refurbishment of the heritage building on platform 1.|$|R

5000|$|Enlarged version {{built for}} P&O Irish Sea {{as a partner}} to the European Causeway. Differences include minor {{revisions}} to the passenger deck layout, additional <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> {{and the use of}} larger lifeboats rather than Marine evacuation systems ...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{is an important}} example of Victorian Queen Anne architecture, with gothic influences. The {{building is}} also notable for {{having one of the}} first <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> in a private house. It is a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
50|$|The Aichi small-elevator {{manufacturing}} {{corporation is}} manufacturer of vertical transportation systems today, principally elevators and Dumbwaiters.

50|$|There will be 32 {{stations}} on the Green Line - 13 {{are currently}} operational. Each station has around 60 surveillance cameras. 36 <b>passenger</b> <b>lifts</b> and 52 escalators {{are built on}} the 13 stations of Reaches 3 and 3A.|$|R
5000|$|The two upper {{galleries}} can use heavily filtered {{natural light}} from the glass pyramids on their flat roofs. Three concrete towers run vertically {{through the middle of}} the structure and contain the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift,</b> service lift and service duct. Between 1972 and 2008 a kinetic light sculpture, which responds to wind force, stood {{on the roof of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> tower. This famous London landmark was designed and built by Philip Vaughan and Roger Dainton [...] as a way to attract visitors to the gallery. It was removed in order for renovation to take place which involved replacing the original neon lighting with LEDs, but subsequently a decision has been taken not to reinstall it.|$|R
