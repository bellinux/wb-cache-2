5|$|Mature plasmodia {{can produce}} fruit bodies under {{appropriate}} circumstances, the exact triggers for this process are unknown. According to laboratory researchers, changes in humidity, temperature or pH value {{as well as}} starvation periods {{were thought to be}} the triggers in some species. The plasmodia abandon their nutrient intake and crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores. Once the fructification begins, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be stopped. If disturbances occur, malformed spore-bearing fruit bodies are often produced.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E

25|$|As already mentioned, the Spanish {{version of}} the Halakot Gedolot, {{probably}} made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would not be far wrong in setting the 9th century as the date of composition.

25|$|The Hybrid III {{dummy for}} three-, six- and ten-year olds has its implications, {{and does not}} provide the same {{physical}} outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When {{using data from the}} real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> easily relate to three-year olds when dealing with neck and head injuries which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for this criteria.|$|E
