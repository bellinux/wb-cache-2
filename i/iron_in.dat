5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic.

5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig <b>iron</b> <b>in</b> liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the <b>iron</b> <b>in</b> liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
