5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time <b>dimension.</b> <b>In</b> this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time <b>dimension.</b> <b>In</b> this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial dimensions, and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial dimensions, and one time <b>dimension).</b> <b>In</b> order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory is}} also tied to smaller amount of <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> smaller systems with the {{universe}} expansion being a suggested motivating phenomenon for growth {{of the number of}} dimensions with time, suggesting a larger number of <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> systems on larger scale.|$|R

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy {{addressed}} the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 {{in and around}} the Way Kambas National Park in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer had no pupils and {{no direct}} 'school'. Yet as his works spanned , clear traces of his {{influence}} {{can be found in}} the grand operas of Fromental Halévy, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and others. After 1850, Huebner notes a continuing tradition of operas at Paris where 'principals appear with chorus at the end of an act and where private intrigue conjoins a well-articulated public <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> the plot' and cites amongst others Charles Gounod's La nonne sanglante (1854), Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet and operas by Jules Massenet, amongst them Le roi de Lahore (1877) and Le Cid (1885). The line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of Wagner in Paris after 1890 (see below). The influence of Meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of Antonín Dvořák and other Czech composers, and in the operas of Russian composers including Rimsky-Korsakov and the young Tchaikovsky, who thought Les Huguenots 'one of the greatest works in the repertoire'.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons {{move into}} an old house, {{wondering}} at its low cost. Their questions are answered when the walls begin to bleed and objects begin to fly through the air, and Lisa senses an evil presence in the house. There is also a portal to another <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen. Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it, due {{to the cost of}} buying the house. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Marge unlike the others however, is instead using her knife to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting - a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement. After the Spirit of The House threatens them again, Marge loses her patience and confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house thinks it over, and eventually opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|Within the series, Connor is the superhuman son of {{the title}} {{character}} Angel, who is a vampire. Introduced in the third season as a newborn, Connor is kidnapped and taken to a hell <b>dimension</b> <b>in</b> an act of revenge against his father. He returns as a battle-hardened, disturbed teenager who has been raised to hate Angel. His consequent violent and estranged relationship {{with his father and}} increasing internal conflict making him shift alliances between protagonists and antagonists forms the storyline for his character. Towards the end of season four, events take their toll on Connor's sanity, and his memories are rewritten to give him a normal life. The next time he appears in season five, Connor is a well-adjusted person. At the return of his memories, Connor finally reconciles with Angel in the series finale. The comic book series follows Connor accepting his abilities and role of a hero in addition to maintaining a normal life as a college student.|$|E
