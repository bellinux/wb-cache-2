500|$|As {{part of its}} eclecticism, the New Age draws {{ideas from}} many {{different}} cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to [...] "a very vague claim" [...] about underlying global unity. Certain societies are more usually chosen over others; examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the Essenes, Atlanteans, and ancient extra-terrestrials. As noted by Hammer: [...] "to put <b>it</b> <b>bluntly,</b> no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians {{are not part of}} our cultural stereotypes". According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic [...] "Other" [...] for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put <b>it</b> <b>bluntly,</b> in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as {{directly}} rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being [...] "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies." [...] Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, [...] "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put <b>it</b> <b>bluntly,</b> we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [...] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." [...] He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand [...] "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," [...] to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had [...] "slipped" [...] from its positions. [...] "According to you," [...] Khrushchev continued, [...] "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." [...] The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, [...] "You are like Stalin who killed people," [...] to which Hoxha replied, [...] "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{regarded}} northern Italians to {{be strongly}} Aryan but not southern Italians. He even admitted that The Ahnenerbe, an archaeological organization {{associated with the}} SS, asserted that archaeological evidence proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples {{in the region of}} South Tyrol in the Neolithic era that it claimed proved the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on northern Italy. The NSDAP regime regarded the ancient Romans to have been largely a people of the Mediterranean race however they claimed that the Roman ruling classes were Nordic, descended from Aryan conquerors from the North; and that this Nordic Aryan minority was responsible for the rise of Roman civilization. The National Socialists viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the deterioration of the purity of the Nordic Aryan ruling class through its intermixing with the inferior Mediterranean types that led to the empire's decay. In addition, racial intermixing in the population in general was also blamed for Rome's downfall, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Due to the darker complexion of Mediterranean peoples, Hitler regarded them as having traces of Negroid blood and therefore did not have strong Nordic Aryan heritage and were thus inferior to those that had stronger Nordic heritage. Hitler held immense admiration for the Roman Empire and its legacy. Hitler praised post-Roman era achievements of northern Italians such as Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Dante Alighieri, and Benito Mussolini. The Nazis ascribed the great achievements of post-Roman era northern Italians to the presence of Nordic racial heritage in such people who via their Nordic heritage had Germanic ancestors, such as NSDAP Foreign Affairs official Alfred Rosenberg recognizing Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci as exemplary Nordic men of history. German official Hermann Hartmann wrote that Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was clearly Nordic with deep Germanic roots because of his blond hair, blue eyes, and long face. The Nazis claimed that aside from biologically Nordic people that a Nordic soul could inhabit a non-Nordic body. Hitler emphasized the role of Germanic influence in Northern Italy, such as stating that the art of Northern Italy was [...] "nothing but pure German", and National Socialist scholars viewed that the Ladin and Friulian minorities of Northern Italy were racially, historically and culturally a part of the Germanic world. To put <b>it</b> <b>bluntly,</b> Hitler declared in private talks that the modern Reich should emulate the racial policy of the old Roman-Germanic Holy Empire, by annexing the Italian lands and especially Lombardy, whose population had well preserved their original Germanic Aryan character, unlike the lands of East Europe, with its racially alien population, scarcely marked by a Germanic contribution. According to him, German are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people. Plans to incorporate northern Italy into the Greater Germanic Reich were influenced by the collapse of the fascist Italian government in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Judge Forrest chided the U.S. Government for the {{handling}} of the case. Judge Forrest provided the U.S. government [...] "with prompt notice in the form of declarations and depositions of the... conduct in which plaintiffs are involved and which they claim places them in fear of military detention." [...] But in return no witnesses were called nor any documentary evidence submitted nor any declarations filed by the U.S. government according to Forrest. [...] "It must be said {{that it would have been}} a rather simple matter for the government to have stated that as to these plaintiffs and the conduct as to which they would testify, that [...] 1021 did not and would not apply, if indeed it did or would not," [...] she said. Forrest went on: [...] "To put <b>it</b> <b>bluntly,</b> to eliminate these plaintiffs' standing simply by representing that their conduct does not fall within the scope of 1021 would have been simple. The government chose not to do so – thereby ensuring standing and requiring this court to reach the merits of the instant motion." [...] According to Forrest plaintiffs demonstrated [...] "a more-than-plausible claim that the statute inappropriately encroaches on their rights under the 1st Amendment." [...] Forrest observed and concluded: The government was given a number of opportunities at the hearing and in its briefs to state unambiguously that the type of expressive and associational activities engaged in by plaintiffs – or others – are not within [...] 1021. It did not. This court therefore must credit the chilling impact on 1st Amendment rights as reasonable – and real.|$|E
