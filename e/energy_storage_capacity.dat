An activated building wall (building thermal mass), a phase change material (PCM) tank, a hot water (HW) tank and a thermochemical material (TCM) storage are simulated and their charging and discharging behavior are optimized.

To this end, a simplified but still accurate model of the UC is developed.

40|$|Many marine {{invertebrates}} including ctenophores {{are capable of}} extensive body regeneration when injured. However, as for the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, {{there is a constant}} subportion of individuals not undergoing whole body regeneration but forming functionally stable half-animals instead. Yet, the driving factors of this phenomenon have not been addressed so far. This study sheds new light on how differences in food availability affect self-repair choice and regeneration success in cydippid larvae of M. leidyi. As expected, high food availability favored whole-body regeneration. However, under low food conditions half-animals became the preferential self-repair mode. Remarkably, both regenerating and half-animals showed very similar survival chances under respective food quantities. As a consequence of impaired food uptake after injury, degeneration of the digestive system would often occur indicating limited <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>capacities.</b> Taken together, this indicates that half-animals may represent an alternative energy-saving trajectory which implies self-repair plasticity as an adaptive trade-off between high regeneration costs and low <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>capacities.</b> We conclude that self-repair plasticity could lead to higher population fitness of ctenophores under adverse conditions such as in ships’ ballast water tanks which is postulated to be the major vector source for the species’ spreading around the globe...|$|R
