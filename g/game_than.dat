5|$|Tatsunoko vs. Capcom was {{conceived}} when Tatsunoko Production asked Capcom {{to develop a}} game with Tatsunoko characters. In-company discussions at Capcom about it started in mid-2006; Capcom producer Ryota Niitsuma was interested in producing a fighting game, and agreed with other Capcom employees that Tatsunoko's characters would be better suited for a Vs. <b>game</b> <b>than</b> a Street Fighter game. The resulting project was the seventh Capcom-designed entry in the Vs. series and the first in over seven years. In the 2000s decade, fighting games were less popular and plentiful than in the mid-1990s, with multiplayer competition shifting towards other genres.|$|E

5|$|EarthBound Ness became {{widely known}} {{due to his}} later {{appearance}} in the Super Smash Bros. series. He appeared in the original Super Smash Bros. and its sequels: Melee, Brawl, and 3DS/Wii U. In Europe, which did not see an original EarthBound release, Ness is better known {{for his role in}} the fighting <b>game</b> <b>than</b> for his original role in the role-playing game. He returned in the 2001 Melee with EarthBound Mr. Saturn, which could be thrown at enemies and otherwise pushes items off the battlefield. Melee also had an unlockable Fourside level based on the EarthBound location. Ness was joined by Mother 3 Lucas in Brawl, and both characters returned in 3DS/Wii U, its sequel. Players can fight in the 3DS Magicant stage, which features clips from the Mother series in its background.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound Ness became {{widely known}} from his later {{appearance}} as an ensemble cast {{member in the}} Super Smash Bros. fighting game series, including the original Super Smash Bros. (1999) and its sequels: Melee (2001), Brawl (2008), and 3DS/Wii U (2014). Ness's inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises, and renewed Mother series fans' faith in new content from Nintendo. Ness {{was one of the}} game's most powerful characters, according to IGN, if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers. In Europe, which did not see an EarthBound release, Ness was better known {{for his role in the}} fighting <b>game</b> <b>than</b> for his original role in the role-playing game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the western}} localization, the Square Enix staff used {{analysis}} from their subsidiary companies in London and Los Angeles to readjust {{the game for}} Western audiences. Director Takeshi Arakawa and producer Yoshinori Kitase announced that the release date for the western world would be August 25, 2009 (starting in North America), {{and that it will}} include a number of small changes, including re-adjustments in gameplay, new gameplay events, an arcade gameplay mode, a shortened tutorial, new moves for playable characters, and extra cutscenes featuring cameos from several other characters from the main characters' original games that do not appear in the Japanese version. Arakawa referred to the Western version as a more action-based <b>game</b> <b>than</b> the original Japanese version which was more RPG-based.|$|E

5|$|On March 8, 2016, Johnson {{announced}} his retirement from the NFL after nine seasons. His 11,619 receiving yards rank third in a player's first nine seasons, trailing only Torry Holt (11,864) and Jerry Rice (11,776). Since Johnson was drafted by the Lions with the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, no player has more receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and 100-yard games (46) than Johnson through the 2015 season. Among those who have played in 100 career games in NFL history, no player has averaged more receiving yards per <b>game</b> <b>than</b> Johnson. Johnson's average of 86.1 receiving yards per game is 8.7 yards better than the next-closest player on that list, Torry Holt. His 5,137 receiving yards from 2011 to 2013 are the most by any player over a three-year stretch in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod, {{built in}} the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early {{computer}} custom-built to play a computer game, {{one of the first}} games developed in the early history of video games. The twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot (3.7-by-2.7-by-1.5-metre) computer, designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams, allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of Nim against an artificial intelligence. The player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with lights on the machine to select their moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its calculations represented by more lights. The speed of the Nimrod's calculations could be slowed down to allow the presenter to demonstrate exactly what the computer was doing, with more lights showing the state of the calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the <b>game</b> <b>than</b> the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Grant Kirkhope, who previously worked {{as the main}} composer for Perfect Dark, Donkey Kong 64, and Banjo-Kazooie. As Banjo-Tooie was a larger <b>game</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game's cartridge for sound effects and music. Kirkhope initially had to pause his work on Banjo-Tooie to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time. Like the original, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player's location. Due to the game having larger memory space Kirkhope was able to combine two MIDI files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations. The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed. Banjo-Tooie {{was presented at the}} 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo and released on 20 November 2000. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.|$|E

5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the <b>game</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E
5|$|Gas Powered Games {{was founded}} in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of <b>game</b> <b>than</b> before, and after trying several concepts the team decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. As well as helping create the initial concept, Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the game's other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the game's lead story and dialogue writer. Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started; Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and background story to him. The game's music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. The development team included around thirty people during development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion. The development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth <b>game</b> <b>than</b> the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E

5|$|MÃ¼ller {{was named}} in Germany's {{provisional}} 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare {{when he fell}} off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, MÃ¼ller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by MÃ¼ller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3â€“1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started {{the first game of}} Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal â€“ his first internationally â€“ in a 4â€“0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4â€“1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4â€“0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. MÃ¼ller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain <b>game</b> <b>than</b> any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3â€“2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including MÃ¼ller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ã–zil.|$|E
