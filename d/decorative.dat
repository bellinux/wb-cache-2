5|$|A {{number of}} Liliaceae genera are popular {{cultivated}} plants {{in private and}} public spaces.

They are also an economically important product.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be <b>decorative</b> patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} <b>decorative</b> geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for <b>decorative</b> effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decorative</b> mosaic tilings made {{of small}} squared blocks called {{tesserae}} were widely employed in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying geometric patterns.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{he went to}} the Technical College of Delft. From 1919 to 1922, Escher {{attended}} the Haarlem School of Architecture and <b>Decorative</b> Arts, learning drawing and the art of making woodcuts. He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of subjects (partly due to a persistent skin infection) and switched to <b>decorative</b> arts, studying under the graphic artist Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, tessellations {{have been}} used to create <b>decorative</b> motifs since ancient times. Mosaic tilings often had {{geometric}} patterns. Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most <b>decorative</b> were the Moorish wall tilings of Islamic architecture, using Girih and Zellige tiles in buildings such as the Alhambra and La Mezquita.|$|E
5|$|Jaeger and Wiley, in 2015, {{looked at}} readers' ability {{to monitor their}} own {{comprehension}}. Their study used a science text as {{the base of a}} lesson and <b>decorative</b> images as the seductive details. They found that readers were less able to monitor their own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with <b>decorative</b> images.|$|E
5|$|Rideau Cottage is {{characterized}} and distinguished by its symmetry, simple lines, classically inspired central entrance with pedimented porch, sash windows flanked by <b>decorative</b> shutters, and paired chimneys.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the <b>decorative</b> arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of <b>decorative</b> painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as <b>decorative</b> motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and <b>decorative</b> flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur {{contains}} approximately 2,670 individual bas reliefs (1,460 {{narrative and}} 1,212 <b>decorative</b> panels), which cover the façades and balustrades. The total relief surface is , {{and they are}} distributed at the hidden foot (Kāmadhātu) and the five square platforms (Rupadhatu).|$|E
5|$|Corals from seamounts {{are also}} vulnerable, {{as they are}} highly valued for making {{jewellery}} and <b>decorative</b> objects. Significant harvests have been produced from seamounts, often leaving coral beds depleted.|$|E
5|$|Elk hides {{have been}} used for {{thousands}} of years for tepee covering, blankets, clothing and footwear. Modern uses are more <b>decorative,</b> but elk skin shoes, gloves and belts are not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make <b>decorative</b> items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and <b>decorative</b> items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian <b>decorative</b> arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna <b>decorative</b> motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 a {{memorial}} to the demolished school was placed {{to the side of}} the Clal Center, facing Jaffa Road. The memorial consists of a <b>decorative</b> iron gate etched with the name of the school in French. The gate is mounted between two stone pillars; it is not standing in its original location.|$|E
5|$|In 2011–2012, {{as part of}} the {{conversion}} of Jaffa Road into a pedestrian-only zone, a small parking area between the Clal Center and Jaffa Road was redeveloped into a public square. The project, costing over 4 million shekel, added a granite pavement, public seating, trees, and <b>decorative</b> lighting.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a study {{examining}} truthiness {{was carried}} out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington.

5|$|In Islamic Spain, it {{was used}} for filling <b>decorative</b> pools. Later, the American artist Alexander Calder built a mercury {{fountain}} for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. The fountain is now {{on display at the}} Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook <b>decorative</b> tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more <b>decorative</b> tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
5|$|In art, mythology, religion, {{literature}} and film, plants play important roles, symbolising themes such as fertility, growth, purity, and rebirth. In architecture and the <b>decorative</b> arts, plants provide many themes, such as Islamic arabesques and the acanthus forms carved on to classical Corinthian order column capitals.|$|E
