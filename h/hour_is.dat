5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> used instead.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per <b>hour,</b> <b>is</b> growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety <b>Hour</b> <b>is</b> {{a comedy}} show {{featuring}} various songs and sketches in {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. It features Homer, Marge, Bart, and Maggie. Lisa refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive blonde bombshell (voiced by Pamela Hayden). After the introduction there is a sketch, where the family are portrayed as beavers living in a dam with Tim Conway as a skunk and Homer's boss. The show ends with a medley of songs sung by the family, Jasper Beardley and Waylon Smithers.|$|E
50|$|Unequal <b>hours</b> <b>were</b> {{the result}} of {{dividing}} up the period of daylight into 12 equal hours, and night time into another 12. In Europe, there is more daylight in the summer, and less night, so each of the 12 daylight <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> longer than a night hour. Similarly in winter, daylight <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> shorter, and night <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> longer. These unequal <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> shown by the curved lines radiating from the center. The longer daylight hours in summer can usually be seen at {{the outer edge of}} the dial, and the time in unequal <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> read by noting the intersection of the sun hand with the appropriate curved line.|$|R
50|$|The Society {{opens the}} Observatory to the Public, Tuesday evenings. Winter <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 7.30-9.30pm, Summer <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 8.30-10.30pm. Group bookings by arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The Binghamton Police Patrol Division {{is divided}} into three daily shifts (reliefs). 'Relief One' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 10:45pm to 6:45am, 'Relief Two' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 6:45am to 2:45pm, and 'Relief Three' <b>hours</b> <b>are</b> 2:45pm to 10:45pm. Each shift {{consists}} of 1 Captain, 1 Lieutenant, 3 Sergeants, several patrol officers, and 1 K-9 unit.|$|R
5|$|The name {{of local}} time {{typically}} changes when DST is observed. American English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> British Summer Time (BST), and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names, e.g. Central European Time (CET) becomes Central European Summer Time (CEST).|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety <b>Hour</b> <b>is</b> {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
5|$|The show's writers begin {{each day}} with a morning meeting where they review {{material}} that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah — who describes his role {{as that of the}} captain of a team — has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal. An <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, captain Grubbs had 21,043 hours of flight time, of which 564 <b>hours</b> <b>were</b> on the 747.

5|$|The war, lasting {{less than}} three {{quarters}} of an <b>hour,</b> <b>is</b> considered the shortest in recorded history. Several durations are given by sources, including 38, 40 and 45 minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take {{the start of the}} war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of the war is usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with St George indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, Thrush at 09:40, Racoon at 09:41, and Philomel and Sparrow at 09:45.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, an <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} 1/12 {{of the time}} from sunrise to sunset, so, during the winter, an hour can be much less than 60 minutes, and during the summer, it can be much more than 60 minutes. This {{proportional}} <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> known as a sha'ah z'manit (lit. a timely hour). A Jewish <b>hour</b> <b>is</b> divided into 1080 halakim (singular: helek) or parts. A part is 3⅓ seconds or 1/18 minute. The ultimate ancestor of the helek was a small Babylonian time period called a barleycorn, itself equal to 1/72 of a Babylonian time degree (1° of celestial rotation). These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes.|$|E
