5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most of the students <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, {{his father had been}} suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E

25|$|Of these groupings, the Independents {{integrated}} {{the most}} readily into Canadian capitalist society. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> registering their land groups, and largely remained in Saskatchewan. Much later on (in 1939) they definitively rejected {{the authority of}} Petr Verigin's great-grandson, John J. Verigin.|$|E
25|$|It {{was there}} that he decided that the {{predisposition}} of Americans to see blacks as inferior was a learned viewpoint. The French <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> blacks learning and interacting with others. Therefore, he determined to become an abolitionist upon his return to America.|$|E
25|$|In a 2017 {{interview}} on French Canadian television, {{he opened up}} about his time being drafted by the Nordiques. He later stated that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Quebec City or the people, stating that his wife is French Canadian. He stated that the real reason was he did not respect Marcel Aubut and criticized on how he would never play for him. At {{the end of the}} interview, he was given the Nordiques igloo and fleur-de-lys jersey at last, 26 years after the saga began.|$|E

25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> perfect babies.|$|E
25|$|The defeat on the House of Lords issue {{turned a}} {{wing of the}} Conservative Party led by Henry Page Croft and his Reveille Movement, against Balfour. Leo Maxse began a Balfour Must Go {{campaign}} in his newspaper, the National Review, and by July 1911 Balfour was contemplating resignation. Law himself <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Balfour's leadership, and along with Edward Carson attempted to regain support for him. By November 1911 it was accepted that Balfour was likely to resign, with the main competitors for the leadership being Law, Carson, Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain. When the elections began, Long and Chamberlain were the frontrunners; Chamberlain commanded the support of many tariff reformers, and Long that of the Irish Unionists. Carson immediately {{announced that he would}} not stand, and Law eventually announced that he would run for Leader, the day before Balfour resigned on 7 November.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, {{by the end of}} the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with WWE Raw Magazine, he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to his or Hall's fans expectations, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with Kevin Nash re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.|$|E

500|$|James Plath from DVD Town said, [...] "Estelle Harris, as George's mother, is hilarious." [...] Although {{he himself}} {{did not appear}} in the episode, John F.

500|$|The songs {{written by}} Prince were {{criticized for being}} [...] "too out of place". While Burton has stated he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the Prince songs, he was less {{enthusiastic}} with their use in the film. On the film, Burton remarked, [...] "I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, {{but it was more}} of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Some, such as Petaling Jaya city {{councillor}} Richard Yeoh, {{believe that}} Abdullah Ahmad, an aide of Mahathir's, {{was the first}} to use the term [...] "ketuanan Melayu". Yeoh described the context in which Ahmad used it as [...] "a fairly benign speech and most of us might have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> it, but it has been taken to mean Malay supremacy by some Umno leaders who don't necessarily know what it means." ...|$|E

500|$|Frank Scheck, of The Hollywood Reporter, {{rated the}} film as poor, saying the film is [...] "more {{suitable}} for late night cable viewing" [...] than a theatrical release. He went on to criticize Uekrongtham's directing, saying that [...] " [...] clearly [...] {{paid more attention to}} the casting than the onscreen mechanics. And for a film so seemingly interested in educating audiences about the evils of sex trafficking", Scheck pointed out, Uekrongtham <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> [...] "including copious doses of female nudity".|$|E
500|$|Buzz Aldrin, {{the second}} man {{to walk on the}} Moon, and {{musician}} James Taylor both guest star as themselves in this episode. Some of the writers were concerned about Aldrin's line, [...] "second comes right after first", feeling it was insulting to Aldrin. An alternative line was written: [...] "first to take a soil sample", but Aldrin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> saying the original line. A version of James Taylor's [...] "Fire and Rain" [...] was recorded specifically for the episode containing some altered lyrics. Taylor's original recording session was included as an extra on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, Batman {{refuses to}} use guns because {{his parents were}} murdered with a firearm. In this tale, Leatherwing's parents were murdered at sword-point, but he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> using a sword.|$|R
50|$|Goldacre <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea}} of someone {{choosing}} to give their body a rest after overindulging, say. That is just common sense. But he sees detox treatments as the modern equivalent of religious rituals of purifcation or abstinence. Clearly, such rituals fill a human need in some way - Goldacre <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> that. What is wrong, however, is to pretend that these detox rituals are based in science. They are not. At worst, they are supposed quick-fixes that distract from the genuine lifestyle risk factors for ill health that affect us over the long term.|$|R
5000|$|I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Bruce Springsteen.—when {{asked by}} the New York Daily News why he has such a {{problematic}} relationship with [...] "the Boss" [...] (a nickname shared by both Springsteen and Steinbrenner).|$|R
500|$|Danny Elfman {{was worried}} the {{characterization}} of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character {{was inspired by the}} Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. [...] "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," [...] Selick continued. [...] "I think {{those are some of the}} most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|E
500|$|Lars Larson, {{the first}} {{interview}} subject, was infuriated after seeing the finished program. He had {{been led to believe}} that the episode would present a far more positive picture of American gay life. Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} human race and were out to kill as best they could." [...] Jack Nichols was fired from his job as a hotel sales manager the day after the program aired.|$|E
500|$|In 2006 DC drew {{widespread}} {{media attention}} by announcing a new, lesbian {{incarnation of the}} well-known character Batwoman even while openly lesbian characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in DC Comics. It was revealed at the 2009 New York Comic Con {{that she would be}} DC Comics' highest profile gay superhero, appearing in a new Justice League comic book written by James Robinson and taking over as the lead character in Detective Comics with issue #854. Greg Rucka said that DC's editors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> his writing Montoya or Batwoman as lesbian, but the media controversy over Batwoman's sexuality [...] "nullified any positive effect Batwoman might have had on the industry" [...] and forced the character into minor roles during major crossover storylines. In 2011 Batwoman gained her own title as part of The New 52 DC comics relaunch. [...] This makes her the first LGBT character to headline a monthly series in the DC Universe.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{criticized by}} rivals for his {{perceived}} levels of wealth, Bajatović once remarked, [...] "I am a Socialist, but I {{do not want}} to be a social case." [...] On another occasion, he said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that I am one of the most strongly attacked and criticized figures in the country, who is believed to be immensely rich. Sometimes I am accused of being overbearing because I am opinionated and do not flinch from expressing my views. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> all the criticism nor the harsh accusations in some media against me. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> my big mouth either." ...|$|R
