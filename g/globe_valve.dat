50|$|A <b>globe</b> <b>valve,</b> {{different}} from ball valve, {{is a type}} of valve used for regulating flow in a pipeline, consisting of a movable disk-type element and a stationary ring seat in a generally spherical body.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{globe valves}} {{in the past}} had the spherical bodies which gave them their name, many modern globe valves do not {{have much of a}} spherical shape. However, the term <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> is still often used for valves that have such an {{internal}} mechanism. In plumbing, valves with such a mechanism are also often called stop valves since they don't have the global appearance, but the term stop valve may refer to valves which are used to stop flow even when they have other mechanisms or designs ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>valves</b> {{are named}} for their spherical body shape {{with the two}} halves of the body being {{separated}} by an internal [...] This has an opening that forms a seat onto which a movable plug can be screwed in to close (or shut) the valve. The plug is also called a disc or disk. [...] In <b>globe</b> <b>valves,</b> the plug is connected to a stem which is operated by screw action using a handwheel in manual <b>valves.</b> Typically, automated <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> use smooth stems rather than threaded and are opened and closed by an actuator assembly.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} work in <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> has mainly been conducted over {{a narrow range}} of laminar or turbulent flow. The work available in laminar flow has not been conducted in geometrically similar valves, hence dynamic similarity could not be established-a critical precursor to practical engineering hydraulic design. In this work various Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, including viscoplastic fluids, were tested in three <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> (with circular plug disk) of 15 mm, 25 mmand 40 mmnominal diameters on a Balanced Beam Tube Viscometer (BBTV). A single constant was obtained in laminar flow to determine the loss coefficient for all the sizes of valves and types of fluids tested in the valve, indicating that dynamic similarity had been achieved. Consequently a correlation could be developed to determine the loss coefficient in <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> in both the fully open and half open positions. Dynamic similarity was obtained using a Reynolds number that accounted for the fluid rheology, specifically the yield stress...|$|R
50|$|Control valves are {{normally}} fitted with actuators and positioners. Pneumatically-actuated <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> and Diaphragm Valves {{are widely used}} for control purposes in many industries, although quarter-turn types such as (modified) ball, gate and butterfly valves are also used.|$|R
50|$|A V port {{ball valve}} has either a 'v' shaped ball or a 'v' shaped seat. This allows for linear and even equal {{percentage}} flow characteristics. When the valve {{is in the}} closed position and opening is commenced the small end of the 'v' is opened first allowing stable flow control during this stage. This type of design requires a generally more robust construction due to higher velocities of the fluids, which might damage a standard valve. These {{can be referred to}} as a type of control valve but are typically not as accurate as a balancing valve, needle valve, <b>globe</b> <b>valve,</b> or pressure regulating valve.|$|E
5000|$|Globe valves are {{typically}} two-port valves, although three port valves are also produced mostly in straight-flow configuration. Ports are {{openings in the}} body for fluid flowing in or out. The two ports may be oriented straight {{across from each other}} or anywhere on the body, or oriented at an angle (such as a 90Â°). [...] Globe valves with ports at such an angle are called angle globe valves. Globe valves are mainly used for corrosive or high viscous fluids which solidify at room temperature. This is because straight valves are designed so that the outlet pipe is in line with the inlet pipe and the fluid has a good chance of staying there in the case of horizontal piping. In the case of angle valves, the outlet pipe is directed towards the bottom. This allows the fluid to drain off. In turn, this prevents clogging and/or corrosion of the valve components over a period of time.A <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> can also have a body {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y". This will allow the construction of the valve to be straight at the bottom as opposed to the conventional pot type construction (to arrange bottom seat) in case of other valves. This will again allow the fluid to pass through without difficulty and minimizes fluid clogging/corrosion in the long term.|$|E
40|$|Valves {{control the}} fluid flow and {{pressure}} {{in a system}} or a process. Globe valves have good throttling ability, which permits its use in regulating flows. Detailed understanding of flow in <b>Globe</b> <b>valve</b> with cage apertures of various shapes {{and its impact on}} the flow characteristics and optimization was carried out. The computational study was carried out using FLUENT, a finite volume based code. Grid sensitivity test were done and the results validated experimentally. The effect of aperture configuration on flow characteristics and valve coefficient was studied to arrive at optimum value. Valve coefficient was found to be dependent on aperture shape and is maximum for the valve with triangular shaped aperture. Methodology to improve flow performance of a <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> with highest valve coefficient is established...|$|E
50|$|Economical <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> or stop valves with {{a similar}} {{mechanism}} used in plumbing often have a rubber washer {{at the bottom of}} the disc for the seating surface, so that rubber can be compressed against the seat to form a leak-tight seal when shut.|$|R
50|$|Ball valves are durable, {{performing}} {{well after}} many cycles, and reliable, closing securely even after {{long periods of}} disuse. These qualities make them an excellent choice for shutoff and control applications, where they are often preferred to gates and <b>globe</b> <b>valves,</b> but they lack their fine control in throttling applications.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{bathroom}} and kitchen taps often use ceramic or plastic surfaces sliding against other spring-loaded ceramic surfaces or plastic washers. These tend to require far less maintenance than traditional <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> and when maintenance is required, the entire {{interior of the}} valve is usually replaced, often as a single pre-assembled cartridge.|$|R

In this paper, a mathematical model of PCGV is established and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to numerically simulate its flow and cavitation characteristics. Analysis of the pressure difference between the upside and downside of the valve core and comparison with similar previous work increase the reliability of the simulation. Then an analysis of flow and cavitation characteristics is carried out with three comparisons: a comparison between opened and closed states, a comparison between different inlet velocities, and a comparison between different valve core displacements. The results demonstrate that the vapor volume fraction reaches its peak point at the valve seat near the outlet tube, and that a higher inlet velocity or smaller valve core displacement can cause greater cavitation damage. This study can help further design work for optimization and engineering applications of PCGV...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because {{of design}} and {{manufacturing}} costs, {{it is important to}} predict an expected life of bellows with component stresses of bellows as its design factors and material characteristics. Besides, if the reliability of the bellows in a bellows-seal valve is not properly assessed, leakage would be occurred easily before the expected life of the bellows. In this study, numerical analyses are carried out to elucidate the thermal and flow characteristics with bellows-seal <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> for high temperature and for high pressure conditions using FSI (Fluid-Structural Interaction) technique. Thermal stress affecting bellows life is depicted with its axial displacement to assess the reliability of the bellows. In addition, we made a basic fuzzy algorithm to add new design parameter.

Also, since the maximum thermal stress of the bellows is below a general yield stress of used material, the reliability of the bellows is established...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap.
