40|$|During the 1980 s and 1990 s, governments {{discovered}} multistakeholder {{processes as}} an effective tool for dealing with difficult issues such as land-use conflicts. In 1991, {{at the height of}} “the war in the woods ” between environmentalists and logging interests in British Columbia, the provin-cial government organized a multistakeholder process, the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE), to bring various interests together in an attempt to resolve land-use conflicts related to logging. This chapter begins by briefly explaining the social context of the CORE process as well as the structure of, and participants in, the process. I then isolate the elements of an effective multistakeholder process. I evaluate CORE by applying these elements to my participant-observer research conducted over a five-year period. The chapter concludes with a series of recommendations for activists to consider before deciding to participate in alternative dispute resolution or multistakeholder processes. The Social and Political Context of CORE Historically, the BC economy has been dependent on the exploitation of natural resources, especially logging, mining, and fishing. Ninety-four percent of the forest land base in the province is publicly owned Crown land. Since the mid- 1940 s, Crown land in British Columbia has been leased to forest companies that are allowed to cut at rates set by the provincial forester (see the discussion of tenure arrangements in the province in Chapter 2). By the 1970 s, public awareness of the amount and type of logging taking place had grown enormously. Damage to the envi-ronment attributed to logging included loss of old-growth <b>ecosystems,</b> <b>destruction</b> of fish habitat from landslides and siltation, and overcutting of timber. These problems were officially recognized by the provincial government’s Royal Commission on Forest Resources in 1976 (Pearse 1976).

In the oceans the radiolarians provide the only detailed record of the fate of planktonic communities and these undergo a phase of stress and final extinction before the marine benthos. The initial phase of the aftermath is characterized by a globally-distributed, low diversity biota and, in shallow, equatorial settings, by the precipitation of Precambrian-like anachronistic carbonates. These are well developed during low points in the δ 13 C record and may be related to super-saturated anoxic waters.
