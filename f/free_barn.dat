40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to show the risk factors affecting the conception rate in Holstein heifers after synchronization of estrus. A total of 275 Holstein heifers housed in a <b>free</b> <b>barn</b> were used for the experiment. The herd was visited regularly at four week intervals for synchronization of estrus using Heatsynch and CIDR-Heatsynch protocols. A group of four to 14 animals, depending on the availability, were referred to the experiment at each visit. Estrus induction rates in the two protocols were 93. 9 % and 94. 9 %, respectively. There was no difference in the conception rate between the two protocols. Conception rate after artificial insemination (AI) or embryo transfer (ET) were 46. 3 % and 51. 4 %, respectively. The risk factors affecting conception rate in heifers were daily weight gain (odds ratio [OR]= 4. 673; P= 0. 036) and body condition score (BCS) (OR= 3. 642; P= 0. 018). Furthermore, estrus synchronization protocol (OR= 1. 774; P= 0. 083) and the absence of corpus luteum (CL) at the initiation of treatment (OR= 0. 512; P= 0. 061) had a tendency to affect the conception rate, while age (OR= 0. 715; P= 0. 008) was a protective factor to conception rate.   In conclusion, positive daily weight gain before AI or ET, higher BCS, younger age, and the presence of CL at the initiation of estrus synchronization in dairy heifers increased the likelihood to conceive...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of stabling technology change and feeding during a stanchion barns (type K- 174) reconstruction to <b>free</b> <b>barn</b> housing. The monitoring was carried out from January 2015 till February 2016. Based on the data obtained from the efficiency control for testing individual samples of milk (Milk Profit Data application) and values of pool samples during individual months were evaluated these parameters: total daily milk production, components of milk and health of dairy cows. In September 2015 were the dairy cows moved from stanchion barn into temporary conditions. There was the change of the feeding technique, housing system and milking. On the 16 th December 2015, cows were moved into the newly renovated barn with a new milking house. After completion of the stress effects, there was an overall improvement of living conditions of cows. There could be seen significant improvement of the milkings hygiene which led to reducing CPM and PSB. It {{had an impact on}} cows health improvement. The change of the feeding technique also helped here. Former individually feeding components were replaced with mixed ration TMR. This resulted in a stabilization of rumen ambience, which reflected on the milk components balance. While in stanchion barn, results showed to diets errors and incidence of metabolic disorders such as acidosis, alkalosis, ketosis and diseases of mammary gland (mastitis).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine barning conditions of dairy farms registered to Cattle Breeders Association (CBA) Ödemiş district of İzmir. The 92 farms were selected among members of the CBA by proportional sampling method. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: group 1 from 5 to 20, group 2 from 21 to 40 and group 3 with over 41 heads, respectively. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: 5 - 20; 21 - 40 and over 41 heads, respectively. The research results indicated that 76. 1 % of the barns were shed type, 15. 2 % were corral, 8. 7 % were completely closed-up. The flooring types of these barns were a mixed of concrete and soil (73. 9 %), concrete (19. 6 %) and soil (6. 5 %). The stocking density for group 1, 2 and 3 were 22. 2 m 2, 19. 5 m 2 and 18. 2 m 2 per cow, respectively. The barns had a range of full cattle capacity from 12. 5 m 2 to 15 m 2 per cow. But none of the farms surveyed did not use fully capacity of the barn. The present running capacity of farms were between 55 % and 80 %. It was observed that 19. 6 % of farms had a individual calf section, 82. 6 % had a night lighting at the barn, and 64. 1 % had a seperate concenrated feed store. All the farms were milked with milking machines. The percentage of farms with bucked milking machine was 47. 8 %, those with an air pipeline system was 37 % and those with parlour system was 15. 2 %.

A training set of commercial poultry feeds and egg albumen from 49 poultry farms across The Netherlands {{was used to determine}} the isotopic variability of organic and conventional feeds and to assess trophic effects of these corresponding feeds and <b>barn,</b> <b>free</b> range, and organic farming regimens on corresponding egg albumen. A further 52 brands of New Zealand eggs were sampled from supermarket shelves in 2008 (18), 2010 (30), and 2014 (4) to characterize and monitor changes in caged, <b>barn,</b> <b>free</b> range, and organic egg farming regimens. Stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes of 49 commercial poultry feeds and their corresponding egg albumens reveals that Dutch poultry are fed exclusively on a plant-based feed and {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between conventional and organic egg farming regimens in The Netherlands. Similarly, it is possible to discriminate between New Zealand organic and conventional egg farming regimens, although in the initial screening in 2008, results showed that some organic eggs had isotope values similar to those of conventional eggs, suggesting hens were not exclusively receiving an organic diet. Dutch and New Zealand egg regimens were shown to have a low isotopic correlation between both countries, because of different poultry feed compositions. In New Zealand, both conventional and organic egg whites have higher δ 15 N values than corresponding Dutch egg whites, due to the use of fishmeal or meat and bone meal (MBM), which is banned in European countries. This study suggests that stable isotopes (specifically nitrogen) show particular promise as a screening and authentication tool for organically farmed eggs. Criteria to assess truthfulness in labeling of organic eggs were developed, and we propose that Dutch organic egg whites should have a minimum δ 15 N value of 4. 8 ‰ to account for an organic plant derived diet. Monitoring of New Zealand egg isotopes over the past 7 years suggests that organic eggs should have a minimum δ 15 N value of 6. 0 ‰, and eggs falling below this value should be investigated further by certification authorities. </p...|$|R

40|$|As California’s dairy {{industry}} continues to grow, manure management {{has become an}} increasingly important issue for dairy producers, government regulators and the public living {{in close proximity to}} dairies. Dairies are increasingly required to prepare nutrient management plans and comply with regulations concerning their manure management practices. A common dairy practice in California is to house the cows in <b>free</b> stall <b>barns</b> with water flush systems to remove the manure. The manure flush water, high in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is collected in holding ponds until it can be combined with freshwater and applied to cropland during irrigation. Being able to quantify the amount of manure water applied is critical to good nutrient management of crops. The high trash and debris content of manure water has precluded the use of most flow meters commonly used in agriculture, such as the propeller meter. A field test of electromagnetic flow meters and a Doppler flow meter determined that both were accurate, dependable and appropriate for measuring manurewater flow rates. Their drawbacks are price ($ 3, 000 to $ 4, 000) and the need for electrical power for permanent flow-meter installations. Accurate flow-rate measurements are needed to more efficiently manage nutrients in water from dairy manure ponds, which is later applied during irrigation. Commonly used in agriculture, the propeller meter often becomes entangled with weeds and twine from a dairy manure pond, making it difficult to obtain readings. There are approximately 2, 200 dairies in California, with more than 1. 4 million cows. The largest concentration of dairies is in Southern California (Riverside and San Bernardino counties...|$|R

The cows of the two herds were fed the same diet distributed using TMR technique, once a day (at 07 : 00). The cows in MP were milked twice daily (at 03 : 00 and at 15 : 00). After AMS installation the AMS herd was constituted of 20 mid-lactating cows, moved from the MP herd.

During these hotter periods, the daily maximum temperature recorded in the rest areas was 28. 9 in SAMM and 31. 2 in STLM, and the daily maximum THI was 78. 2 in SAMM and 81. 5 in STLM. In these periods, the cows in SAMM compared with those in STLM showed lower BR (P < 0. 05) and greater rest time (10. 2 and 7. 8 h/day in SAMM and STLM, respectively). The RT did not differ (38. 89 +/- 0. 29 and 38. 88 +/- 0. 33 A degrees C in STLM and SAMM r,espectively). In conclusion, our research suggests that the cooling system using fans plus misters with mild wetting in rest areas with sand as bedding materials reduces heat stress and improves cow comfort...|$|R
40|$|Relationships were {{developed}} to predict ammonia (NH 3) nitrogen losses from cattle manure in animal housing, during manure storage, following field application, and during grazing. Ammonia loss in each phase was predicted using a mechanistic model for NH 3 volatilized {{from the surface of}} an aqueous solution of ammonium where the NH 3 is transported to the free atmosphere through a pathway with finite resistance. Ammonia emission rate was a function of the ammoniacal N content in the manure, ambient temperature, manure pH, manure moisture content, and the exposed manure surface area. Model relationships were calibrated by selecting values for the resistance to NH 3 transport for the various loss pathways, which predicted daily and annual emissions similar to those reported in published studies. In further evaluation, these calibrated relationships predicted average annual losses similar to those documented in previous work over a range in climate locations. These relationships were integrated into a whole-farm simulation model to provide a tool for evaluating and comparing long-term nitrogen losses along with other performance, environmental, and economic aspects of farm production. Whole-farm simulations illustrated that the use of a <b>free</b> stall <b>barn,</b> bottom-loaded slurry storage, and direct injection of manure into the soil reduced NH 3 emissions by 33 % to 50 % compared to other commonly used dairy housing and manure handling systems in the northeastern U. S. The improvement in nitrogen utilization more than offset the increased cost in manure handling, providing a small increase in farm profit. The farm model provides a research and teaching tool for evaluating and comparing the economic and environmental sustainability of dairy and beef production systems...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{individual}} intakes in dairy cows {{would be beneficial}} to select animals according to efficiency of milk production. The n-alkanes technique {{has been used to}} estimate intake by dairy cows in <b>free</b> stall <b>barns,</b> limiting faecal samples to one or two per day, but diurnal variation in the ratio of dosed to natural alkanes in faeces represents a source of error. We aimed to adapt this technique to estimate feed intake on a large number of lactating dairy cows housed on commercial dairy farms. Using a change-over design, six lactating cows fed a TMR diet were given a dose of 0. 5 g/day of C 32 n-alkane administered once a day as a drench (DRE) or top fed (TP). Feed offered and refused were weighed daily. After the lead-in phases, faeces were collected at 0700 hours, 1400 hours and 1900 hours on the last 5 days of each dosing period. Dry matter intake (DMI) was estimated from C 31, C 33 and C 32 concentrations in feeds and in faeces for each dosing system and sampling time. DMI estimated from C 31 :C 32 ratio was better correlated with measured individual DMI than estimates from C 33 :C 32 ratio. For DRE, the best correlation was for sampling at 1400 hours (R 2 ≤ 0. 96, P < 0. 001), but estimated DMI for the 1400 hours sampling was much higher than the actual DMI. For TP, the best correlation was for sampling at 0700 hours (R 2 ≤ 0. 83, P < 0. 001). Feeding C 32 n-alkane and collecting faeces once a day at the same time (0700 hours) represents a valuable protocol to measure individual intake on a large number of animals. © CSIRO 2014...|$|R
40|$|A taxa de gestação de vacas em lactação e de novilhas confinadas em free stall foi avaliada durante o inverno e o verão, nos anos de 1993, 1994 e 1995. A temperatura ambiente (TA) e a umidade relativa do ar (UR) foram acompanhadas diariamente, durante quatro meses de verão (dezembro a março) e três meses de inverno (junho a agosto). Em cada estação mediram-se semanalmente às 9, 15 e 21 h a temperatura retal (TR) e a freqüência respiratória (FR) de 50 % das vacas em lactação, sorteadas ao acaso, separadas em quatro grupos de acordo com a produção de leite. A TA e o índice de temperatura e umidade (ITU) médios foram mais elevados (P The {{gestation}} {{rate was}} used to evaluate the reproductive performance of dairy cows and heifers confined in a <b>free</b> stall <b>barn</b> during the winter and summer seasons of 1993, 1994 and 1995. The temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) were monitored daily during the summer (December, January, February and March) and winter (June, July and August). The rectal temperature (RT) and respiration rate (RR) were measured weekly at 9 AM and 3 and 9 PM, in each season, in 50 % of the animals randomly selected and sorted in four groups based on their milk production. The averages of T and the temperature and humidity index (THI) were higher in the summer (25. 6 ºC e 75. 8) than in the winter (19. 0 ºC e 65. 3), while the RH were the same in both seasons (80. 0 %). The averages of RT and RR were always higher in the summer and at 3 PM when compared to 9 AM RT and RR (39. 47 ºC and 64. 76 mov/min vs 38. 89 ºC and 44. 21 mov/min). Gestation rate for milking cows was smaller in summer than in the winter. Conversely 85. 4 % of heifers became pregnant during the summer and 78. 5 % during the winter season...|$|R
