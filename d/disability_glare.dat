40|$|There is a {{need for}} a convenient, {{clinically}} applicable test of <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> which can be used in the preoperative evaluation of patients with cataract. In this study, contrast sensitivity (using the Pelli-Robson letter chart), near vision, and visual acuity were compared, with and without the introduction of a glare source in 70 patients with cataract, 15 with intraocular lenses, and 19 controls.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} filtering short wavelength light on visual performance under intense light conditions among pseudophakic patients previously implanted with a clear intraocular lens (IOL). This was a patient-masked, randomized crossover study conducted at 6 clinical sites in the United States between September 2013 and January 2014. One hundred fifty-four bilaterally pseudophakic patients were recruited. Photostress recovery time and <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> thresholds were measured with clip-on blue-light-filtering and placebo (clear; no blue-light filtration) glasses worn over patients’ habitual correction. Photostress recovery time was quantified as the time necessary to regain sight of a grating target after intense light exposure. <b>Glare</b> <b>disability</b> threshold was assessed as the intensity of a white-light annulus necessary to obscure a central target. The order of filter used and test eye were randomized across patients. Photostress recovery time and <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> thresholds were significantly improved (both P< 0. 0001) when patients used blue-light-filtering glasses compared with clear, nonfiltering glasses. Compared with a nonfiltering placebo, adding a clip-on blue-absorbing filter to the glasses of pseudophakic patients implanted with clear IOLs significantly increased their {{ability to cope with}} glare and to recover normal viewing after an intensive photostress.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To {{describe}} ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) {{features in}} a patient with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) and cataract before and after anterior segment surgery using intraocular lens (IOL) and aniridic ring implantation (Morcher Aniridia rings 50 D). METHODS: Visual acuity, subjective <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> intraocular pressure, endothelial cell density, and UBM imaging were reviewed {{over a period of}} 1 year. RESULTS: One month after surgery, the operated eye showed improved visual acuity and visual comfort, and UBM examination showed a well-centered IOL and well-aligned aniridic ring fins. After 8 months, UBM examination showed contraction of the capsular bag, which appeared wrinkled, fibrous, and thickened. The capsular bag comprised the aniridic ring fins, causing misalignment. The <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> had dropped from grade 0 to 3. The same outcome was present at 1 year.

50|$|Glare can be {{generally}} {{divided into two}} types, discomfort glare and <b>disability</b> <b>glare.</b> Discomfort glare results in an instinctive desire to look away from a bright light source or difficulty in seeing a task. <b>Disability</b> <b>glare</b> impairs the vision of objects without necessarily causing discomfort.

5000|$|One {{can observe}} {{the effect of}} {{straylight}} by looking at a distant bright light source against a dark background.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Standard {{examination}} of contrast sensitivity {{under conditions of}} <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> is performed with incandescent light. A new halogen glare test that simulates glare as seen with oncoming vehicle headlights {{was used to measure}} <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> in patients implanted with multifocal and monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs).  METHODS— 28 patients with an average age of 69  years (SD 12  years) were implanted with a monofocal IOL (SI- 40 NB, Allergan) and 28  patients with an average of 66  years (12  years) were implanted with a refractive multifocal IOL (Array-SA- 40 N, Allergan). All patients were followed for 5  months postoperatively. Contrast sensitivity at four spatial frequencies (3,  6,  12, and 18  cycles per degree, cpd) with and without a glare source were measured using the halogen glare test (CSV- 1000 HGT). Statistical analysis was performed using the two sample Wilcoxon test. The local significance level was set at 0. 05.  RESULTS—When tested at the lowest spatial frequency (3  cpd) without halogen glare, contrast sensitivity was lower in the multifocal group than in the monofocal group (p= 0. 0292). With additional glare, {{there was no difference between}} both groups. At all other spatial frequencies (6,  12, and 18  cpd), when tested without halogen glare (6  cpd, p= 0. 5250; 12  cpd, p= 0. 8483; 18  cpd, p= 0. 9496) and with moderate (3  cpd, p= 0. 7993; 6  cpd, p= 0. 4639; 12  cpd, p= 0. 7456; 18  cpd, p= 1. 0) and high halogen glare (3  cpd, p= 0. 1513; 6  cpd, p= 0. 2016; 12  cpd, p= 0. 3069; 18  cpd, p= 0. 9933), there was no statistically significant difference between groups. Patients in both groups of age 70  or older had reduced contrast sensitivity without halogen glare and with moderate and strong glare. When monofocal and multifocal patients older than 70  years of age were analysed separately, there was no statistically significant difference in contrast sensitivity with and without glare. Astigmatism > 1 dioptre had no significant influence on contrast sensitivity and <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> when monofocal and multifocal eyes were compared.  CONCLUSION—Reduced contrast sensitivity was found in the multifocal group only at the lowest spatial frequency without halogen glare. The monofocal and multifocal groups had no statistically significant differences in contrast sensitivity with moderate and strong glare. These results suggest no difference in <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> induced by halogen light similar to oncoming vehicle headlights for patients implanted with monofocal and multifocal IOLs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A certain {{percentage}} of patients complain of “glare ” at night after undergoing a refractive surgical procedure. When patients speak of glare they are, technically, describing a decrease in quality of vision secondary to <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> decreased contrast sensitivity, and image degradations, or more succinctly, “night vision disturbances. ” The definitions, differences, and methods of measurement of such vision disturbances after refractive surgery are described in our article. In most cases of corneal refractive surgery, {{there is a significant}} increase in vision disturbances immediately following the procedure. The majority of patients improve between 6 months to 1 year post-surgery. The relation between pupil size and the optical clear zone are most important in minimizing these disturbances in RK. In PRK and LASIK, pupil size and the ablation diameter size and location are the major factors involved. Treatment options for disabling glare are also discussed. With the exponential increase of patients having refractive surgery, the increase of patients complaining of scotopic or mesopic vision disturbances may become a major public health issue in the near future. Currently, however, there are no gold-standard clinical tests available to measure <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> contrast sensitivity, or image degradations. Standardization is essential for objective measurement and follow-up to further our understanding of the effects of these surgeries on the optical system and thus, hopefully, allow for modification of our techniques to decrease or eliminate post-refractive vision disturbances.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis project {{explored}} {{the relationship of}} the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) spatial profile with measures of <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> (GD) across the macula. MethodsA novel device was used to measure MPOD across the central 16 ° of retina along four radii using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry (cHFP) at eccentricities of 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 6 ° and 8 °. MPOD was measured as discrete and integrated values at all measured retinal loci. GD was calculated as a difference in contrast sensitivity (CS) between no glare and glare conditions using identical stimuli presented at the same eccentricities. GD was defined as [(CSNo Glare−CSGlare) /CSNo Glare] in order to isolate the glare attenuation effects of MPOD by controlling for CS variability among the subject sample. Correlations of the discrete and integrated MPOD with GD were compared. ResultsThe cHFP identified reliable MPOD spatial distribution maps demonstrating a 1 st-order exponential decay as a function of increasing eccentricity. There was a significant negative correlation between both measures of foveal MPOD and GD using 6 cycles per degree (cpd) and 9 cpd stimuli. Significant correlations were found between corresponding parafoveal MPOD measures and GD at 2 and 4 ° of eccentricity using 9 cpd stimuli with greater MPOD associated with less <b>glare</b> <b>disability.</b> ConclusionsThese results are consistent with the glare attenuation effects of MP at higher spatial frequencies and support the hypothesis that discrete and integrated measures of MPOD have similar correlations with glare attenuation effects across the macula. Additionally, peak foveal MPOD appears to influence GD across the macula...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether augmentation of macular pigment (MP) enhances visual performance (VP). 121 normal subjects were recruited. The active (A) group consumed 12 mg of lutein (L) and 1 mg of zeaxanthin (Z) daily. MP optical density (MPOD) was assessed by customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. VP was assessed as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity (CS), <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> photostress, and subjective visual function. Subjects were assessed at baseline; 3; 6; 12 months (V 1, V 2, V 3 and V 4, respectively). Central MPOD increased significantly in the A group (p 0. 05). This statistically significant increase in MPOD in the A group was not, in general, associated with a corresponding improvement in VP (p > 0. 05, for all variables), {{with the exception of a}} statistically significant time/treatment effect in “daily tasks comparative analysis” (p = 0. 03). At V 4, we report statistically significant differences in mesopic CS at 20. 7 cpd, mesopic CS at 1. 5 cpd under high glare conditions, and light/dark adaptation comparative analysis between the lower and the upper MP tertile groups (p < 0. 05) Further study into the relationship between MP and VP is warranted, with particular attention directed towards individuals with low MP and suboptimal VP.

Present physiological measures are {{of little use}} in visual performance research, but threshold and supra-threshold measures can be usefully used. The effects of illuminance, <b>disability</b> and discomfort <b>glare,</b> luminance distribution and colour on visual performance are then reviewed. Illuminance has the most important effect. The only other important variable is that of veiling reflections. The effect of the operational variables of subjects’ age, visual capability and the work characteristics are examined and indicate that human factors {{are more important than}} physical factors in their effect on visual performance.

40|$|Background: In the 1920 s and 1930 s, <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> was a {{topic of}} great {{interest}} in the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE). The Second World War prevented agreement being reached on a standard to quantify <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> but the Stiles-Holladay formula was widely accepted as such. In 1983, CIE started a new effort to develop a CIE standard making use of research data published in the post-war years. Methods: A committee was formed that agreed that new data and insights justified {{an extension of the}} angular domain of a <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> formula and allowed introduction of an age factor and allowance for ocular pigmentation. Results: Three <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> equations were formulated, each for an appropriately restricted angular domain. The most general, the CIE General <b>Disability</b> <b>Glare</b> equation, covers the full angular range between 0. 1 degrees and 100 degrees but for optometrists the CIE Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay <b>Disability</b> <b>Glare</b> equation, with validity domain between one degree and 30 degrees, will often suffice. Conclusions: <b>Disability</b> <b>glare</b> is due to intraocular scatter and obeys, in the one-degree to 30 -degree angular domain, albeit with great individual spread, the Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay equation: (Lveil/E glare) Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay = 10 (1 + [Age/ 70] 4). 1 /θ 2.

40|$|Modern life is {{associated}} with a myriad of visual problems, most notably refractive conditions such as myopia. Human ingenuity has addressed such problems using strategies such as spectacle lenses or surgical correction. There are other visual problems, however, that have been present throughout our evolutionary history and are not as easily solved by simply correcting refractive error. These problems include issues like <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> and discomfort arising from intraocular scatter, photostress with the associated transient loss in vision that arises from short intense light exposures, or the ability to see objects in the distance through a veil of atmospheric haze. One likely biological solution to these more long-standing problems has been the use of colored intraocular filters.

40|$|Introduction The {{carotenoids}} lutein (L), zeaxanthin (Z) and meso-Z (MZ) accumulate at the macula {{where they}} are collectively referred to as macular pigment (MP). Scientific research continues to explore the function(s) of MP in the human retina, with two main hypotheses premised on its putative capacity to (1) protect the retina from (photo) -oxidative damage by means of its optical filtration and/or antioxidant properties, the so-called protective hypothesis and (2) influence the quality of visual performance by means of selective short wavelength light absorption prior to photoreceptor light capture, thereby attenuating the effects of chromatic aberration and light scatter, the so-called acuity, visibility and glare hypotheses. The current epidemic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has directed researchers to investigate the protective hypothesis of MP, while {{there has been a}} conspicuous lack of work designed to investigate the role of MP in visual performance Objectives This M. Sc. (by Research) thesis has four primary objectives: 1. To present and critically appraise the current literature germane to the contribution of MP, if any, to visual performance and experience 2. To assess whether MP optical density (MPOD) is associated with visual performance (Study One) 3. To investigate whether augmentation of MPOD enhances visual performance in normal subjects (Study Two) 4. To assess whether MPOD is associated with colour discrimination and matching (Study Three) Methods Study One: The Relationship between Macular Pigment and Visual Performance One hundred and forty-two young healthy subjects were recruited. MPOD was assessed by customised heterochromatic flicker photometry (cHFP). Visual performance was assessed by psychophysical tests including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity, <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> photostress recovery time (PRT). Study Two: The Impact of Macular Pigment Augmentation on Visual Performance in Normal Subjects One hundred and twenty-one normal subjects were recruited. The active (A) group consumed 12 mg of L and 1 mg of Z daily. MPOD was assessed by cHFP. Visual performance was assessed as BCVA, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity, <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> photostress, and subjective visual function. Subjects were assessed at baseline; three; six; twelve months (V 1, V 2, V 3 and V 4, respectively). Study Three: Macular Pigment: its Associations with Colour Discrimination and Matching One hundred and two normal subjects were recruited. Colour vision was assessed with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test (FM 100), Moreland match on the Heidelberg Multi Colour (HMC) Anomaloscope, and a customised short wavelength automated perimetry (cSWAP) technique at the foveola and at 1 °, 2 °, 3 °, 4 ° and 5 ° of retinal eccentricity. MPOD spatial profile was measured using cHFP. Results Study One: The Relationship between Macular Pigment and Visual Performance We report a positive and statistically significant relationship between BCVA and MPOD across its full spatial profile (r = 0. 237 to 0. 308, P 0. 05). Study Two: The Impact of Macular Pigment Augmentation on Visual Performance in Normal Subjects Central MPOD increased significantly in the A group (P 0. 05). This statistically significant increase in MPOD in the A group was not, in general, associated with a corresponding improvement in visual performance (P > 0. 05, for all variables), {{with the exception of a}} statistically significant time/treatment effect in “daily tasks comparative analysis” (P = 0. 03). At V 4, we report statistically significant differences in mesopic contrast sensitivity at 20. 7 cpd, mesopic contrast sensitivity at 1. 5 cpd under high glare conditions, and light/dark adaptation comparative analysis between the lower and the upper MP tertile groups (P < 0. 05). Study Three: Macular Pigment: its Associations with Colour Discrimination and Matching Total error scores (TES) and % partial error scores (%PES) on the FM 100 were uncorrelated to MPOD. Moreland matches shown a significant long wavelength shift with MPOD at between 1 ° and 3 ° (at 1. 75 °, r = 0. 489, P < 0. 001). Sensitivities on cSWAP using foveal targets were significantly inversely correlated with MPOD at both 1. 75 ° (r = - 0. 461, P < 0. 001) and 3 ° (r = - 0. 393, P < 0. 001). Partial correlation analysis suggests that none of these findings can be attributed to age effects within the range 18 to 40 years. Conclusions Study One: The Relationship between Macular Pigment and Visual Performance Measures of central visual function, including BCVA and contrast sensitivity, were positively associated with MPOD. <b>Glare</b> <b>disability</b> and photostress recovery were unrelated to MPOD Study Two: The Impact of Macular Pigment Augmentation on Visual Performance in Normal Subjects We report that a significant increase in central MP following L supplementation does not, in general, impact on visual performance in young normal subjects, and our pre-specified hypothesis that MP augmentation would result in improved visual performance and/or comfort by 12 months, in those randomised to the A arm, remains unproven. However, subjects with high MP following L supplementation demonstrate visual benefits with respect to <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> and mesopic contrast sensitivity. Further study into MP and its relationship with visual performance is warranted to enhance our understanding of this pigment‟s role. However, in order to investigate the impact of MP augmentation on visual performance, the findings of our study suggest that we should direct our attention to, a) subjects with low baseline central MP levels, b) subjects with suboptimal visual performance and c) subjects with symptoms of <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> Study Three: Macular Pigment: its Associations with Colour Discrimination and Matching Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation to increase MPOD is unlikely to adversely affect hue discrimination.

Recently, both anecdotal reports and formal experiments have indicated that headlamp size and spectral power distribution affect discomfort glare, but no assessment {{has been made of}} whether these two factors also affect <b>disability</b> <b>glare.</b> Models of <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> suggest that they should not. The present experiment was designed to provide empirical evidence about this issue. Subjects were presented with glare stimuli that varied in size (0. 3 or 0. 6 degrees of visual angle) and spectral power distribution (tungsten-halogen or high-intensity discharge). Discomfort glare was measured by numerical ratings of subjective discomfort. <b>Disability</b> <b>glare</b> was measured by determining the luminance threshold for detecting a pedestrian silhouette presented near the glare source. Spectral power distribution affected discomfort glare, although, in contrast to previous studies, which had shown small but statistically significant effects, size did not affect discomfort glare.

Typical applications of {{this research}} results, could be road and tunnel lighting requirements on <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> restrictions when LED sources are used...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simulation}} method {{to evaluate and}} visualize <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> problems. Mathematical calculations of visual degradations due to optical imperfections in the eye are performed on luminance photos of scenes {{and the result is}} visualized. The method was evaluated in three indoor and outdoor cases where different visual aspects on <b>disability</b> <b>glare</b> were studied. Overall, the simulations predicted problem areas in the scenes to a large extent. The method was also applied in a light rendered 3 D-model and gave indications for improvements of the light setting. Aspects on improving environmental planning by better understanding of human vision are discussed...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To compare {{straylight}} values {{before and}} 3 months after hyperopic laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) {{and determine the}} cause of any change SETTING Private refractive surgery clinic, Driebergen, The Netherlands DESIGN Comparative case series METHODS Stray light (by definition the measure for <b>glare</b> <b>disability)</b> was measured preoperatively and postoperatively with a C-Quant straylight meter and recorded as log(s) The main outcome measures were the difference between postoperative and preoperative straylight values RESULTS The mean increase in straylight from preoperatively to postoperatively was 0 051 log(s) +/- 0 158 (SD) in the LASIK group (39 eyes) and 0 031 +/- 0 146 log(s) in the LASEK group (26 eyes) Although neither change was statistically significant, it was clinically significant in some cases Haze or interface debris was seen in some eyes with increased straylight The mean postoperative spherical equivalent refraction was - 0 05 +/- 0 27 diopter CONCLUSIONS Although straylight increased slightly after hyperopic LASIK and LASEK, the increase was not statistically significant Some eyes with increased straylight had haze or interface debris The cause of the increased straylight could not be determined in some case...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To assess visual {{function}} and its response to serial intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech) {{in patients with}} neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nv-AMD). Methods. Forty-seven eyes of 47 patients with nv-AMD, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) logMAR 0. 7 or better, undergoing intravitreal injections of ranibizumab, were enrolled into this prospective study. Visual function was assessed using a range of psychophysical tests, while mean foveal thickness (MFT) was determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Results. Group mean (±sd) MFT reduced significantly from baseline (233 (± 59)) to exit (205 (± 40)) (P= 0. 001). CDVA exhibited no change between baseline and exit visits (P= 0. 48 and P= 0. 31, resp.). Measures of visual function that did exhibit statistically significant improvements (P< 0. 05 for all) included reading acuity, reading speed, mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity (CS), mesopic and photopic <b>glare</b> <b>disability</b> (GD), and retinotopic ocular sensitivity (ROS) at all eccentricities. Conclusion. Eyes with nv-AMD undergoing intravitreal ranibizumab injections exhibit improvements in many parameters of visual function. Outcome measures other than CDVA, such as CS, GD, and ROS, should not only {{be considered in the}} design of studies investigating nv-AMD, but also in treatment and retreatment strategies for patients with the condition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether augmentation of macular pigment (MP) enhances visual performance (VP). 121 normal subjects were recruited. The active (A) group consumed 12 mg of lutein (L) and 1 mg of zeaxanthin (Z) daily. MP optical density (MPOD) was assessed by customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. VP was assessed as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity (CS), <b>glare</b> <b>disability,</b> photostress, and subjective visual function. Subjects were assessed at baseline; 3; 6; 12 months (V 1, V 2, V 3 and V 4, respectively). Central MPOD increased significantly in the A group (p 0. 05). This statistically significant increase in MPOD in the A group was not, in general, associated with a corresponding improvement in VP (p> 0. 05, for all variables), {{with the exception of a}} statistically significant time/treatment effect in “daily tasks comparative analysis” (p= 0. 03). At V 4, we report statistically significant differences in mesopic CS at 20. 7 cpd, mesopic CS at 1. 5 cpd under high glare conditions, and light/dark adaptation comparative analysis between the lower and the upper MP tertile groups (p< 0. 05) Further study into the relationship between MP and VP is warranted, with particular attention directed towards individuals with low MP and suboptimal VP...|$|R
