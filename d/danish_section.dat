40|$|As {{a result}} of a lithological, sedimentological and biostratigraphic study of well <b>sections</b> from the <b>Danish</b> sector of the North Sea, {{including}} some recently drilled exploration wells on the Ringkøbing–Fyn High, the lithostratigraphic framework for the siliciclastic Palaeogene to Lower Neogene sediments of the Danish sector of the North Sea is revised.

40|$|The palaeobiology of {{echinoderms}} {{occurring in}} the Meerssen and Geulhem members is discussed and changes in diversity across the K/T boundary are documented. Using literature data on the ecology of extant faunas, the various echinoderm groups are considered. Naturally, such data can only be applied with due caution to fossil forms, whose skeletal morphology is often incompletely known. This holds especially true for asteroids, ophiuroids, and crinoids, which, upon death, rapidly disintegrate into jumbles of dissociated ossicles. Bioturbation, scavenging, and current winnowing all contribute to blurring the picture still further. However, data on extant forms do allow a preliminary subdivision of fossil species into various ecological groups, which are discussed herein. Combining recently published data on K/T boundary sections in Jylland and Sjælland (Denmark) with the picture drawn here for the Maastricht area results in the following best constrained scenario. The demise of the highly diverse latest Maastrichtian echinoderm faunas, typical of shallow-water settings with local palaeorelief and associated unconsolidated bottoms, was rapid, suggestive of a catastrophic event (e. g. increased storm activity {{as a result of}} an asteroid impact). Following is the possible equivalent of the ‘dead zone’ of the <b>Danish</b> <b>sections,</b> capped by the Vroenhoven hardground at the base of the Geulhem Member. At present, due to the lack of bulk samples from the Geulhemmerberg sections, the range of echinoderms between the Berg en Terblijt and Vroenhoven horizons (= section IVf- 7 of the Meerssen Member) cannot be fully tested. The earliest Danian echinoderms (e. g. bourgueticrinid crinoids and goniasterid asteroids) occur in fossil hash levels resting on top of the Vroenhoven Horizon, suggesting some time-averaging to have occurred. The immigration of these elements into the study area thus seems to have been rapid. Plotted on a recently published palaeogeographical map of the K/T boundary interval in Denmark, data for the Maastricht area enable a ‘K/T boundary sea’ to be extended to well south of the Ringkøbing-Fyn High, a structural high. However, the absence of such typical elements as representatives of the echinoid genus Echinocorys and isocrinid crinoids from the lower Geulhem Member demonstrates that echinoderm settlement was strongly influenced by local conditions, depth and/or energy related. In short, echinoderm distribution across the K/T boundary in the Maastrichtian type area would indicate rapid extinction of (sub) tropical shallow-water communities, and a subsequent recovery phase characterised by (?rapid) immigration from the north/northwest, linked with an earliest Danian (post-Cerithium Kalk) transgressive pulse. Faunal links with the Danish/North Atlantic region seem to have persisted until the Middle Danian, but by that time local conditions appear to have returned to the pre-K/T boundary development of palaeorelief in the area...|$|R

40|$|A high {{resolution}} calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic analysis {{was carried out}} across the Danian/Selandian transition at the Zumaia section (western Pyrenees). In the studied interval, spanning Varol’s Subzone NTp 7 a to Zone NTp 9, a sequence of 10 distinct calcareous nannofossil events is identified. The recognition of these bioevents confirms the continuous and expanded character of the Zumaia section and allows an accurate biostratigraphic correlation of the D/S transition between Zumaia, the <b>Danish</b> reference <b>sections</b> and the more southerly Tethys sections. According to this correlation, the abrupt transition from the upper Danian limestones (the calcisiltite unit) to the Lellinge Greensand that marks the D/S boundary in the type area correlates with the lithological change from the Aitzgorri Limestone Formation to the Itzurun Formation in Zumaia. The calcareous nannofossil bioevents recorded {{in connection with the}} organic-rich layer used to mark the base of the Selandian in the Tethys region were detected in Zumaia ~ 10 m below the top of the Aitzgorri Limestone Formation. This finding suggests that the organic-rich layer is considerably older than the Danian/Selandian (D/S) boundary at Zumaia and the type area, and thus using it to mark the D/S boundary in Tethys is not appropriate. According to a counting of limestone/marl couplets, which are demonstrated to be the stratigraphic expression of precession cycles throughout the Zumaia section, the organic-rich layer in the Tethys region is ~ 546 kyr older than the D/S boundary at the type area...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{asymmetrical}} mutual intelligibility relation of Danish and Swedish, combining production and perception of native and non-native sounds to investigate the role of lenition and phonetic dissimilarities between languages in mutual intelligibility. In the first chapter I give an outline of the previous literature on mutual intelligibility (section 1. 1), lenition (section 1. 2), and <b>Danish</b> intervocalic lenition (<b>section</b> 1. 3). In chapter 2 I formulate research questions and hypotheses on the experiments, which I describe in chapter 3 and 4. Chapter 3 is a chapter on production, describing the phonetic analysis of Danish and Swedish sounds (more specifically: pre- and intervocalic stops) after which I formulate more detailed predictions on the subsequent chapter (chapter 4) on perception. In chapter 4 I describe a perception experiment with Danish and Swedish participants, of which I link the results {{with the results of}} the production experiment in the general discussion in chapter 5. This thesis shows that Danish intervocalic lenition is not a factor in the Danish-Swedish asymmetrical intelligibility relation. Furthermore, the results show that perception of non-native sounds seems to be guided by different mechanisms than perception of native sounds. ...|$|R

But {{it was not until}} 1871, when news of the Paris Commune swept Europe, that he established contact with formal socialist movements. In that year, he resigned from the Danish postal service, and began a written correspondence with the German-speaking branch of the Socialist International in Geneva, as well as meeting like-minded socialists in Copenhagen. Together with Harald Brix and Poul Geleff, he labored to set up a <b>Danish</b> <b>section</b> of the Socialist International, following the English model of setting up trade unions. [...] During the day, Pio worked as a tutor for a wealthy bourgeois family, and during the evenings he wrote for Socialisten, Brix's new weekly newspaper whose first edition was published on May 21, 1871. The paper was very successful, and Pio became the main writer for its articles as well as the main theoretician for the group of socialists. Ideologically, Pio did not hew to a narrow path, and presented ideas primarily from Ferdinand Lassalle and Karl Marx. [...] On October 15, 1871, the <b>Danish</b> <b>section</b> of the Socialist International was founded, with Pio as its foreman. His leadership was controversial since other Danish socialists considered his style somewhat dictatorial, but he established good contacts with socialist movements elsewhere in Europe, maintaining an extensive correspondence with other socialist leaders, much of which survives today.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of corporate communication {{in recent years}} has brought about a fading of the division of labor between commercial and non-commercial organizations. While the practices of commercial organizations are becoming increasingly ethicalized, so the practices of non-profit organizations are becoming increasingly commercialized. This paper explores the use of media discourse for the communication of ethical messages by humanitarian organizations, caught, as they are, in a tension between, on the one hand, the commercial strategies of visibility and still greater dependence on the media, and, on the other hand, the public’s skepticism toward mediated morality and what is commonly referred to as compassion fatigue. The issue is investigated through an analysis of a TV spot produced by the <b>Danish</b> <b>section</b> of Amnesty International in 2004. This spot is taken {{as an example of how}} the organization’s branding strategies testify to a high degree of reflexivity about the conditions of what Luc Boltanski calls a Crisis of Pity. The analysis illustrates how, in the face of compassion fatigue, the organization manages to carve out a new space for itself in the marketized ethical discourse, and leads to a discussion of the consequences of such rebranding for the construction of morality by the organization...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for a {{triggering}} mechanism for the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary event, 55 Ma, centimeter-resolution chemical (e. g., Ir, Os, Pt) and isotope (e. g., (OS) -O- 187 /Os- 188, He- 3 /He- 4, Sr- 87 /Sr- 86) records across this boundary have been established for six uplifted marine sections in Egypt, Spain and Denmark. The sections studied represent some of the stratigraphically most complete records across the onset of the carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) and associated benthic foraminifera extinctions that mark the Paleocene-Eocene boundary. High-sensitivity analyses failed to uncover evidence of extraterrestrial element or isotope enrichments in the six sections, refuting the hypothesis of a major comet impact at the boundary. Preliminary searches for other impact-indicative features, such as spherules or shocked quartz, also gave negative results. In the <b>Danish</b> <b>section</b> studied, three basaltic Ir-rich ash layers occur at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, but no similar ashes were found in Egypt or Spain. The three ashes represent the earliest known manifestation of an unusual I to 2 million year long phase of explosive basaltic volcanism in the Faero-Greenland region. This volcanism is synchronous with major flood basalt effusions in East Greenland and is associated with prominent paleogeographic changes in the high-latitude North Atlantic region. Discharge of mantle-derived Os to seawater during this volcanism may explain a small decrease in (OS) -O- 187 /(OS) -O- 188 ratio at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in the Zumaya section in Spain. The environmental perturbations at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary appear to have been triggered by basaltic volcanism, but any model for the detailed causal relation remains speculative.
