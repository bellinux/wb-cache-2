25|$|<b>Gravure</b> <b>printing</b> is an {{intaglio}} printing technique, where the image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E
50|$|Gravure is an {{industrial}} printing process capable of consistent high quality printing. Since the <b>Gravure</b> <b>printing</b> process requires {{the creation of}} one cylinder for each colour of the final image, it is expensive for short runs and best suited for high volume printing. Typical uses include long-run magazines in excess of 1 million copies, mail order catalogs, consumer packaging, Sunday newspaper ad inserts, wallpaper and laminates for furniture where quality and consistency are desired. Another application area of <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> is in the flexible-packaging sector. A wide range of substrates such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, BOPP, etc. can be printed in the gravure press. <b>Gravure</b> <b>printing</b> {{is one of the}} common processes used in the converting industry.|$|E

40|$|Halftone gravure {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication gravure industry. Halftone gravure refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a gravure cylinder. This procedure has allowed the publication gravure industry {{to benefit from the}} prepress advantages of offset printing. Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a halftone <b>gravure</b> <b>print</b> and a SWOP standard offset press proof in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether an allowable color tolerance could be achieved between the <b>gravure</b> production <b>print</b> and the SWOP standard offset press proof. The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of gravure inks used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a <b>gravure</b> <b>print</b> and a SWOP standard offset press proof. It was important to compare the <b>gravure</b> <b>print</b> to the SWOP standard offset press proof because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset press proof as the standard or control parameter.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{artificial neural network}} modeling is a viable tool to predict the processing dependence of <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> light-emitting polymer layers for flexible OLED lighting applications. The (local) thickness of <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> light-emitting polymer (LEP) layers was analyzed using microdensitometry, after which the data was used to train a multi-layer neural network using error back propagation. Cell engraving depth, printing speed, and polymer concentration were used as input parameters of the neural network. Mean printed layer thickness, relative RMS roughness and feature anisotropy were defined as output parameters. The inhomogeneity of the <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> LEP layers was defined by two parameters, being the normalized standard deviation from the mean layer thickness, {{as well as the}} anisotropy or 'directionality' of the roughness features. Despite the limited number of input parameters, a fair prediction accuracy was obtained once new input data was fed into the trained network. The prediction error for the three output parameters was of the order: anisotropy > roughness > mean layer thickness. Calculating the magnitude of the output parameters {{as a function of the}} total space determined by the input parameters can be used as a way to find optimal printing conditions. These 'landscape' plots also reveal qualitative information on the rheological behavior of the inks during the printing process. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Printing {{technologies}} {{divide between}} sheet-based and roll-to-roll-based approaches. Sheet-based inkjet and screen printing {{are best for}} low-volume, high-precision work. Gravure, offset and flexographic printing are more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m²/h). While offset and flexographic printing are mainly used for inorganic and organic conductors (the latter also for dielectrics), <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> is especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, due to high layer quality. If high resolution is needed, gravure is also suitable for inorganic and organic conductors.
