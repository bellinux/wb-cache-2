5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> balustrade.|$|E
5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former more sympathetic to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{receive a}} warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The {{visitors}} are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young Maharaja, Zalim Singh. Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient Thuggee cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. They discover a series of tunnels <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> statue in Willie's room {{and set out to}} explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.|$|E

5|$|During her {{exploration}} of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|E
5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> bulletproof glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June 1936, the Havørn Accident {{became the}} first fatal air crash of a civil {{airliner}} in Norway.

25|$|The St. Ignatius Chapel also {{hosts the}} {{restored}} macchina barocca or conversion machine of Andrea Pozzo. During daytime {{the statue of}} St. Ignatius is <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> large painting, but every day at 17.30 loud religious music is played and the painting slides away in the floor, revealing the statue, with large spotlights switched on to show the piece.|$|E
25|$|However, Dr. Coppelius did not expel all the girls: Swanhilda {{is still}} there, <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> curtain. She dresses up in Coppélia's clothes and pretends that the doll {{has come to}} life. She wakes Franz and then winds up all the {{mechanical}} dolls to aid their escape. Dr. Coppelius becomes confused and then saddened when he finds a lifeless Coppélia behind the curtain.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 1145 the relic {{was placed}} in a box which has the seal of Cardinal Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, raised to the {{cardinal}}ate in 1124 as cardinal priest of this church, who became Pope in 1144, as Lucius II, thus dating the seal. It was apparently forgotten until February 1, 1492, when it was discovered by workmen restoring a mosaic, <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> brick with the inscription Titulus Crucis.|$|E

The body of Captain Núñez was left on the beach.|$|E
25|$|The funicular/lift rises {{along an}} 11.8% incline to the Rua da Bica de Duarte Belo, a {{distance}} of , from the Rua de São Paulo. The transit system includes the Rua da Bica, Largo de Santo Antoninho and Travessa da Bica Grande. The Bica funicular, much like the Funicular of Lavra and the Glória Funicular, is moved by the Tramway system: using cable and water weights, with the cars equipped with water deposits. The lower station is almost <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> facade on the Rua de S. Paulo with the inscription Ascensor da Bica.|$|E
25|$|Under the Pomeroys {{the castle}} {{consisted}} of a dry moat (now mostly infilled), gatehouse and ramparts surmounted by the curtain wall with buildings disposed around the wall on the inside. Due to the extensive remodelling that took place later, very few archaeological remains survive to show the exact placement of these original buildings. In 1978, a wall painting was discovered in the upper storey of the gatehouse, <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> thick layer of vegetation. It is {{a representation of the}} Adoration of the Magi and has been dated to c.1490–1500 based on its stylistic similarity to European works of the period.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{electric}} or gas lighting the servants rooms and kitchens of this period were dark, dismal, often damp and badly ventilated places. The only advantage of Neoclassical architecture from the servants point of view, was that houses once again began to have pitched roofs, which could contain servant's bedrooms with gabled windows, albeit often <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> stone balustrade or parapet. This arrangement for housing servants persisted in the affluent town houses of Britain into the late 19th century and is particularly common in the great Regency terraces of Belgravia and Mayfair designed by John Nash and later Thomas Cubitt in London.|$|E
25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled {{in a chair and}} leaning {{forwards}} onto the table. They determined that {{the cause of death was}} a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a rolling pin. The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{fragment}} {{that remains of}} a runestone. It was found in 1927 in Västra Hästbo near the church of Torsåker, and today it is almost <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> pillar inside the church. It is in sandstone {{and it is one}} of the older runestones as it is carved in runestone style RAK. This the classification for inscriptions with runic band ends which do not have any attached serpent or beast heads. The runic text indicates that it was raised in memory of a man who went to England. The last word has a bind rune that combines a k-rune and u-rune, but it has been suggested that this was done to correct an error made when carving the text.|$|E

25|$|When {{the king}} {{went to the}} publicity, he was <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> curtain, and had some of his men in front of him, whose duty {{was to keep the}} masses away from the king and to make his way clear. When one came to the king, he/she had to {{prostrate}} before him, also known as proskynesis. The king was guarded by a group of royal guards, known as the pushtigban. On other occasions, the king was protected by a group of palace guards, known as the darigan. Both of these groups were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire, and were under the command of the hazarbed, {{who was in charge of}} the king's safety, controlled the entrance of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed to be given military command or used in negotiations. The hazarbed was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner. During Nowruz (Iranian new year) and Mihragan (Mihr's day), the king would hold a speech.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{on the south side}} of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled gambrel roof has dormer windows and is partly <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The façade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the rightmost of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have architraves, the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.|$|E
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now <b>hidden</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
