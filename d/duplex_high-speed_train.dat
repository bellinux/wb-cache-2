40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on the maximum permissible speeds of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on the maximum speeds of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> moves at a speed of 200 km/h or more. The maximum speeds of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation of a high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> are performed on a model of a train composed of identical axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>train.</b> Practical value.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} changes in consumers' choices and their welfare due {{to the introduction of}} new products, taking firms' reactions into consideration. I perform empirical analyses using Korean transportation industry data to evaluate the impact of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> introduction on passenger travel. This work adds to the existing literature by considering the changes in product characteristics or the set of products offered to consumers after new product introduction, and investigates how those changes affect consumer welfare. The analysis provides a rich insight into the transportation industry and the relationship between the modes of transportation which contributes to enhancing the quality of government's policies regarding related industries. The first part of my thesis investigates the changes in utilization of different modes of transportation in Korea after the introduction of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> using a fixed effect model and a difference in differences model. My results show the significant impact of the introduction of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> on the entire transportation industry and provide evidence that modes of transportation not only compete but also complement each other. After <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> were introduced in 2004, inter-city bus and airline industries lost their customers in routes where they directly competed with high-speed rails, while the numbers of rail passengers increased. The losses in the airline industry were particularly severe. On the other hand, the passengers of other rail lines for some routes not connected by <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> but branch routes of high-speed rail lines, increased. The increase was perhaps induced by the consumers who traveled on those routes in order to reach high-speed rail lines. After the introduction of <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains,</b> other changes such as service schedule adjustment ensued. The results from the reduced form models show only the overall impact of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> introduction, but they cannot disentangle the impact of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> introduction itself from that of ensuing changes. In order to separately examine the impact of <b>high-speed</b> <b>train</b> introduction and that of ensuing changes in product characteristics, I estimate a structural model of the demand for travel that incorporates consumers' heterogeneous preferences over travel schedules into a standard discrete choice model. The model treats the rail company's choice of train schedules as endogenous in order to take the firm's choices of product line into account. My results show that consumers are affected differentially by both the introduction of <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> and the ensuing changes in train schedules. The welfare implications for consumers depend on the availability of <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> in their choice set. Consumers who travel between two cities that are connected by <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> are the main beneficiaries of the new service. However, reductions in schedule frequencies of non-high-speed <b>trains</b> operating along <b>high-speed</b> rail lines, generate losses that offset 50 % of gains even for these consumers. Travelers on these lines who are not served by <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains</b> only experience substantial losses due to reduced schedule frequencies. Consumers who travel between two cities that are not located along high-speed rail lines gain from increased train frequencies, and the gains make up for the losses in other markets without <b>high-speed</b> <b>trains.</b> These results highlight the importance of accounting for changes in existing products when analyzing the impact of new product entry on consumers...|$|R
