25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be sodium bromide, {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals.

The combination of bromine and acetic acid {{is found to be}} highly corrosive and hence the equipment is lined with titanium. A <b>feed</b> <b>mixture</b> containing p-xylene, acetic acid, the catalyst system, and compressed air is fed to a reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where p-xylene is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the p-xylene is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA. The solvent losses are comparatively low, and hence the Amoco process is followed by the industries.|$|E

500|$|Large-scale {{industrial}} fractionation towers use reflux {{to achieve}} more efficient separation of products. Reflux {{refers to the}} portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided, the better is the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. [...] A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the <b>feed</b> <b>mixture.</b> Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called pumparounds.|$|E
