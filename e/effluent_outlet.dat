40|$|The Achères {{wastewater}} treatment plant, located just downstream of Paris, discharges its effluents {{into the lower}} Seine River. The effluents contain large numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, organic matter, and ammonium and {{are a source of}} nitrifying bacteria. As a result, degradation of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria and subsequent oxygen depletion occur immediately downstream of the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlet,</b> whereas nitrifying bacteria apparently need to build up a significant biomass before ammonium oxidation significantly depletes the oxygen. We quantified the potential total nitrifying activity and the potential activities of the ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing communities along the Seine River. In the summer, the maximum nitrifying activity occurs in the upper freshwater estuary, ∼ 200 km downstream of Achères. The quantities of nitrifying bacteria, based on amoA gene copy numbers, and of Nitrobacter organisms, based on 16 S rRNA gene copy numbers, were correlated with the potential nitrifying activities. The species composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria was investigated at two sites: the Triel station just downstream from Achères (km 84) and the Seine freshwater estuary at the Duclair station (km 278). By means of PCR primers targeting the amoA gene, a gene library was created. Phylogenetic analysis revealed {{that the majority of the}} analyzed clones at both sites were affiliated with the genus Nitrosomonas. The Nitrosomonas oligotropha- and Nitrosomonas urea-related clones represented nearly 81 % of the community of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria at Triel and 60 % at Duclair. Two other ammonia-oxidizing clusters of the β subclass of the Proteobacteria, i. e., Nitrosomonas europaea- and Nitrosospira-like bacteria, were found in smaller numbers. The major change in the ammonia-oxidizing community between the two stations along the Seine River-upper estuary continuum was the replacement of the N. oligotropha- and N. urea-related bacteria by the Nitrosospira-affiliated bacteria. Although the diversities of the ammonia oxidizers appear to be similar for the two sites, only half of the restriction patterns are common to both sites, which could be explained by the differences in ammonium concentrations, which are much lower in the upper estuary than in the river at the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlet.</b> These results imply a significant immigration and/or selection of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial population along the continuum of the Seine River from Paris to the estuary...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) in the wastewater effluents of PETZONE and sediments of the Musa Bay (around the PETZONE coastal area) from Jun 2009 to Jun 2010. The primary objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the sources of pollutants and each pollutant‘s distribution, concentration and contamination degree, as well as to assess the biological response to these stressors based on the ecological risk. The levels of TPH concentration in the study area were found to be relatively moderate (with an average value of 48. 98 μg/g) compared to the world-wide chronically oil-contaminated locations. Also the average concentration of PAHs was found to be lower than the guideline values (with a mean value of 3. 40 μg/g) in the study area {{and other parts of the}} bay. The source analysis based on the isomer pair ratios and also the principle component analysis showed that, in addition to petrogenic input as a major source, pyrolytic inputs are also a source for PAHs. Also, the results of Chronic Potency Ratio of PAHs showed that, all the sampling stations meet the guideline value with the exception of the stations 3 -BI and 4 (which are located in the vicinity of the Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini petrochemical company). Furthermore, the contamination factor showed that, the study area can be classified as slightly polluted and be categorized as of low ecological risk. Also, the average value of AMBI was 2. 66, so the study area can be categorized as slightly polluted based on this index. Owing to this index, the pollution level of most of the stations varied between undisturbed and moderately polluted (except stations 3 -BI and 4). In the case of environmental impact assessment (EIA), the PETZONE <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets</b> were monitored and showed that, the average concentrations of PAHs were lower than the guideline values at all the stations; thus the effluents of the study area can be considered unpolluted. Also, the average concentration of TPH was lower than the guideline value at all sampling stations with the exception of the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets</b> of Razi and Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini petrochemical companies which are proximal to Musa Bay and they may have an adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem of the bay. The result of the Risk Priority Number (RPN) based on TPH showed that, Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini petrochemical company can be classified in a category of important environmental aspect, and Razi and Shahid Tondgouyan petrochemical companies can be categorized as moderate environmental aspects; while the rest of the petrochemical companies can be classified as low environmental aspects. Thus, Bandar-e-Imam Khomeini petrochemical company should mitigate the risk and it requires executive management attention and control actions, while, Razi and Shahid Tondgouyan petrochemical companies should plan to manage the risk and decrease it during the long term. In addition, the results of RPN based on PAHs demonstrated that, all the sampling stations can be classified as low environmental aspects, thus more control actions is not necessary but they should be monitored during their activity.

The occurrence of metal enrichment in surface waters and bed sediments coincides mainly with areas of urbanisation and high density traffic in addition to point source discharges including STW and industrial <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets.</b> Non-tidal surface water samples exhibiting Pb, Co, Cu, Fe and Zn concentrations intermittently elevated above EQS List I and II values largely correspond with bed sediment samples exhibiting metal concentrations above background values and commonly partitioned to the mobile exchangeable/acid soluble and reducible fractions. In the tidal reaches surface water samples exhibiting As, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, V and Zn concentrations above EQS List I and II values are generally associated with bed sediment samples exhibiting partitioning to the immobile oxidisable fraction, suggesting that estuarine processes effectively promote the liberation of elements from the sediment compartment to surface waters. Total catchment annual suspended sediment yield, (190 t/km 2 /yr), is consistent with previous research work detailing the annual yield of U. K. rivers which in conjunction with suspended sediment concentration data highlights the importance of the transport and distribution of associated elements throughout the river system.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} freshwater land-based salmonid farms on rivers were studied by monitoring eight farms with substantial differences in annual trout production (29 - 368 t year(- 1)) connected to rivers of contrasted hydrology (mean annual discharge ranging from 0. 3 to 4. 8 m(3) s(- 1)) in France. Samples {{of water and}} benthic invertebrates were collected in the river immediately upstream and at two locations downstream of fish farm outlets during low flow period in summer. Suspended solids, PO 43 - and NH 4 + concentrations increased downstream of the outlets, suggesting that fish food-derived wastes led to a dilute mixture of suspended solids and dissolved nutrients. The total abundance of benthic invertebrates consistently increased immediately downstream of the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets,</b> and a positive correlation was observed with the biomass of fish in the aquaculture facilities at the sampling date. The proportions of oligochaetes and chironomids increased downstream of the farms and, conversely, proportions of ephemeropterans, plecopterans and trichopterans decreased. Similarly, the relative abundances of shredders and scrapers decreased in the benthic invertebrate community downstream of the outlets, whereas deposit-feeders and filter feeders increased. This consistent pattern outlined {{a major change in}} the ecosystem functioning, with particulate organic matter from fish food-derived wastes becoming a central source of energy in river benthic food webs. Furthermore, the taxonomic-based ecological indicator usually used for monitoring biotic integrity in French Rivers overlooked these functional impairments in larger streams (mean annual discharge above 2 m(3) s(- 1)). This study outlines the interest of using benthic invertebrate functional feeding groups together with the results of water chemistry analyses for monitoring the ecological disturbances induced by land-based salmonid farm effluents in running water...|$|R

The {{south-western}} Cape {{is currently}} responsible for 45 % {{of the total}} annual trout production in South Africa and further expansion of this industry {{in the region is}} likely. A pilot study of seven trout farms situated on the upper reaches of rivers in the south-western Cape was undertaken to determine whether there was a common trend in their effect on the rivers. Results indicated that the impact of the farms on the benthic invertebrate communities of the rivers ranged from mild to severe, based on the degree of change {{in the structure of the}} communities form upstream to downstream of the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets.</b> Those farms situated on mountain streams had the greatest impact and those on the downstream foothill had a lesser impact. The reduced impact in the foothill zone was probably because these reaches were already disturbed by other catchment activities. Of the three farms that were situated on mountain streams and source areas, two used plastic portapools and the third earth dams. There was a substantial increase in the number of oligochaetes downstream of both 'portapool' farms and yet, despite being situated in the same sensitive river zone, this did not occur downstream of the farm that used earth dams. The general impact of trout farm effluent on the mountain-stream and source zones was to eliminate or greatly reduce the number of Limnichidae, Helodidae, Plecoptera, Elmidae, Heptageniidae and Ephemerellidae, and, in the case of portapool farms, to replace these with Naididae, Lumbriculidae, Chironomidae and Planaria.

Average values were between 0. 1 and 3. 7 mg kg_ 1 in sediment, and between 0. 2 and 37 mg L_ 1 in water. The sorption of surfactants was dominated by hydrophobic mechanisms, so those homologues having longer alkyl chains (e. g. C 18 AEO) showed higher relative percentages and concentrations in sediments compared with water. Local and sharply higher concentrations of these compounds were observed at three sampling stations (7, 9 and 12), indicating the occurrence of wastewater discharges into the river. By analysing the distributions of different surfactant homologues and their metabolites we were able to distinguish between sewage contamination from sources discharging treated and untreated wastewaters. Upstream (stations 1 – 2), LAS concentrations were below 30 mg L_ 1 and the composition of their degradation intermediates (sulfophenyl carboxylic acids, SPCs) (160 mg L_ 1) was dominated by short-chain homologues (C 6 –C 9 SPCs), indicating that the degradation of this surfactant is at an advanced stage.

Physicochemical measurements are carried out in situ and the sampling points correspond to <b>effluent</b> <b>outlets,</b> compared to two reference stations that are assumed to have little or no contamination. A total of 15 sites were collected: Cambéréne, Yoff Tonghor, Ngor, Almadie-Vivier, Ouakam, Magdalen Islands, Soumbédioune, Dakar Dantec, Hann 1, Hann 2, Port of Dakar, Lac rose, Guédiawaye, Mamelles and UCAD. High sediment toxicity [100 % ADL (Larval Development Anomalies) ] was demonstrated at sixty percent (60 %) of the sites. Twenty percent (20 %) of sites have intermediate toxicity ranging from 30 % to 60 % ADL). Sites with the lowest toxicity (up to 30 % ADL) accounted for only 20 % and no ADL values were reported as nil. Mercury levels in sediments are very low, with a notable variation between sites in the north and those in the south of the peninsula. Coliforms (Escherichia coli) and enterococci are present in large quantities at most sites (64 %). The presence of Salmonella is noted only in Cambéréne. The results of mass spectrometry analyzes also show overall high concentrations of heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn) with the exception of Fe and Mn, which are below the criteria for "Protection of acute and chronic aquatic life". Microplastic analysis revealed high mean values: 25, 864 mpts / km 2 (42 g / km 2) for microplastics (300 µm and 5 mm) and 37, 441 MPTS / km 2 (97. 33 g / km 2) for macroplastics > 5 mm and < 200 mm).

40|$|This {{project has}} been based on obtaining a better {{understanding}} of bench-scale techniques and their limitations for fire toxicity assessment including closed box test (NBS Smoke Density Chamber) and flow-through tests such as the steady state tube furnace (ISO TS 19700). Toxicity results for several different polymers under different fire scenarios have been compared using published data. It was apparent that the closed box test could not readily match the various ISO fire conditions whereas it was generally possible to produce conditions similar to these in the steady state tube furnace but with some limitations. This work has indicated ways of increasing confidence for ISO steady-state tube furnace method by identifying some factors causing variations in steady state burning behaviour and changes to the preset fire test conditions; in particular problems from the possible back flow of secondary air into the furnace tube at low primary flows which alters the preset fire conditions. This can be partially overcome by the use of an orifice plate with appropriate outlet size. Thus Casico power cable has been investigated in the steadystate tube furnace using under-ventilated fire conditions. This gave rise to apparently negative oxygen concentrations inside the furnace tube at low primary airflow, a narrower <b>effluent</b> <b>outlet</b> from the furnace tube is needed, although, this may change the behaviour of fire effluents. Also the apparent reactions between gases and solid residues showed as increasing concentrations of carbon monoxide and decreasing concentrations of carbon dioxide at very high temperatures such as 900 °C and in under-ventilated conditions. A water gas reaction was suggested as a possible cause for this observation. Commercial Casico power cable has been investigated to observe the temperature stability of flaming in the steady state tube furnace apparatus under well-ventilated conditions. It was found that even for very high temperatures such as 900 °C this cable did not burn evenly. This has been explained by the flame retardant properties of the Casico material which forms an intumescent structure in a fire. A study of carbon monoxide yields for LDPE, PVC and a 50 : 50 LDPE/PVC mixture was undertaken as a function of equivalence ratio and the furnace temperature. For the LDPE/PVC mixture, a high CO yield was obtained, higher than for pure LDPE (about 1. 5 times higher) and similar to pure PVC. This may be explained by HCI production interfering in the radical chain mechanism in the gas phase preventing the conversion of CO to CO 2 and results in high CO yield even for well-ventilated conditions. However, at high furnace temperatures (950 °C) this effect diminishes for both PVC and LDPE/PVC mixture systems...|$|E

The second chapter was aimed at studying the quality of water at different areas in Bahrain to compare it with the quality of water at an area adjacent to the refinery outfalls. The third chapter deals with the impact of the refinery on the marine environment. The research approach adopted was ecological and observational I involving water and sediment analysis. The fourth chapter was aimed at studying the effects of the refinery effluents on the fish through toxicity tests and estimation of trace metals and hydrocarbons in the fish tissues. The studies were conducted with several effluents from the main and side streams of the refinery, outlets of the induced air flotation unit and Sitra separator. The fifth chapter was aimed at studying the effect of Sitra oil storage tanks treated effluent on the intertidal fauna of the adjacent area. The sixth chapter deals with a general discussion on the whole studies. While the seventh chapter deals with sions and recommendations. From the study conducted, it could be said that in general the water quality of the western and northern regions of Bahrain is better than the water quality of the eastern region. The east has in general higher pH, higher ammonia, higher nitrite, lower nitrate, and higher phosphate levels than the other regions. The higher concentrations of all these substances reflects the urbanisation and industrialisation of this part of Bahrain and the consequent discharges of waste material. The fish, safee, were tested with different concentrations of the refinery main stream effluent using both short and long term exposures. The same experiment was set up using effluents from the side stream, the I. A. F. discharge of the refinery and Sitra separator outlet. The results indicated a greater toxicity of pollutants in the I. A. F. and Sitar separator effluents than in the main and the side stream effluents. The lethal concentration of I. A. F. and Sitra separator effluents which brought death to fifty percent of the test population of fish (safee) within 96 hours was approximately twenty percent. Fish from the experimental media showed a higner concentration of heavy metals. The study of the effect of Sitra oil storage tanks treated effluent on the intertidal fauna of the adjacent area revealed that no fauna was found at stations located just outside the <b>effluent</b> <b>outlet.</b> The sediment of these stations was black, slimy, heavily oiled with a bad smell and contains dead shells and turrets. Away from the effluent, a diverse fauna was found. It is concluded that the BAPCO refinery has a measurable impact on the marine environment of the east coast of Bahrain, and recommenqations are made tor the development of future policies with regard to Bahraini coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{systems like}} {{constructed}} wetlands and ponds {{have been successfully}} applied in Natural the treatment of domestic wastewater both in warm and cold climate. If well operated and maintained these systems perform well and produce a consistent effluent quality that meets the local permit requirements. This study examines long-term performance data of Vidaråsen wastewater treatment system in Vidaråsen Camphill in Andebu municipality in Norway. Founded in 1966, Vidaråsen Camphill is a first Camphill village in Norway. Vidaråsen is a small community comprising around 200 people. The community includes a dairy, a food-processing workshop, a bakery, a laundry, animal husbandry, horticulture and a herb garden. The Camphill village has its own wastewater treatment system since transport of wastewater to the nearest municipal system would be very expensive. Before 1998, Vidaråsen Camphill had wastewater treatment consisting of chemical precipitation of phosphorus (P) followed by biological treatment in a pond system. However, {{because of the high}} operating cost of the chemical treatment and low reuse value of the chemically precipitated sludge, an entirely new fully nature based treatment system was built in September 1998. The new system utilizes the combination of ponds and horizontal and vertical flow constructed wetlands. The system had test plant status until January 2002 and had to meet the stringent effluent P requirement of 0. 4 mg/l and a total organic carbon (TOC) requirement of 10 mg/l. The system consists of following sequence of treatment units: primary settling tank (septic tank) → two pre-filters (vertical and horizontal flow constructed wetland) → advanced facultative pond (AFP) → three stabilization ponds→and two horizontal flow constructed wetlands. The pre-filters, which are configured in series, are filled with shell sand, which has high P adsorption capacity in comparison to normal sand. The main feature of the AFP is that it has a distinct aerobic and anaerobic zone. The AFP is equipped with flow forms (cascade aeration), which helps to maintain the high level of dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper layer of the pond for enhancement of aerobic degradation. The deep center pit of the AFP is particularly designed to promote anaerobic degradation and thus low sludge production. The AFP is followed by the three stabilization ponds in series. The pond effluent finally passes through two horizontal flow (HF) beds. The horizontal flow constructed wetlands (CW) are filled with shell sand. This study evaluates the performance of the Vidaråsen system for suspended solid (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and Thermotolerant Coliforms (TtC) from 2004 to 2014. The samples were collected several times a year both in warm and cold months. The grab samples from the influent (outlet of the septic tank), final <b>effluent</b> (<b>outlet</b> of HF constructed wetland) are analyzed for BOD, COD and TP. SS, and TtC is analyzed only for the final effluent. Influent and effluent from each treatment stages were analyzed only for TP. The average yearly performance data shows that the Vidaråsen system was capable to meet the effluent permit requirement for all the parameters. The average yearly effluent concentration for SS, BOD, COD, TN, and TTC was 98 %, 99 %, 95 %, 89 % and 99. 9 % respectively. This high degree of removal efficiency is difficult to achieve by stand-alone CW or pond system. Analysis of seasonal performance for nitrogen shows that the effluent concentration increased in colder months. The frequency distribution of outlet phosphorus showed that the system produced outlet phosphorus concentration below 0. 4 mg/l 75 % of the time during sampling. The final outlet total coliform met both the European and Norwegian requirement for a bathing water quality. The per capita area requirement is 11 m 2 which is higher than the compact filter bed used in Norway. The evaluation of treatment performance from this study {{as well as from the}} earlier study shows that even without the ponds number 2 and 3 the system is able to meet the permit requirement. Therefore the optimization of land area should be given due consideration if such systems is to be replicated elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Horizontal {{roughing}} filters (HRF) can properly remove {{suspended solids}} and microorganisms from surface water resources, especially on filtration rates less than 1. 5 m/h. This research {{was aimed at}} suspended solid removal efficiency of HRF during secondary wastewater effluent filtration. Methods: This experimental study was conducted by installing an HRF pilot system on effluent pumping station of Qom wastewater treatment plant based on aerated lagoon process. The pilot was a horizontal cylindrical column consisting of three compartments filled with river gravels in various sizes. Grab samples were simultaneously taken from HRF inlet and outlet in three filtration rates: 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 m/hResults: The results indicated that filtration rate {{had a significant effect}} on the amount of total suspended solids in HRF effluent. During optimum operation of HRF, removal efficiencies of three filtration rates (0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 m/h) were 78. 5, 63. 1, and 66. 9, respectively. Conclusion: T-test analysis indicated that with a significance difference, <b>outlet</b> <b>effluent</b> from HRF in all three flow rates met the standard requirements of Iran Environmental Protection Agency for irrigation and discharge to surface water...|$|R
40|$|The wetland is {{a system}} that uses the roots plants (macrophyte) in the {{domestic}} wastewater treatment. The mechanisms (physical, chemical and biological ones) of organic matter stabilization of effluent and odorous compounds (commonly found in anaerobic biological degradation) involve soil, microorganisms and plants. This work uses olfactometry (technical of odors analysis) as tool in the evaluation of the odor remotion of sewage treated by Root Zone Sewage Treatment Station (RZSTS) in an rural community of Irati City (Brazil). For a better evaluation of the effectiveness of the odor remotion, the odors (rather and downstream treatment) has been evaluated in the three olfactometric categories (intensity, character and hedonic tone), according to European standards. The results had pointed that wastewater treated still presented perceivable levels of odor even after significant reduction in intensity (the reduction in the category “very strong” was 89, 3 % between the entrance and outlet wastewater of the macrophyes station). Moreover, “offensive” category was cited by the jury in the two <b>effluent</b> (entrance and <b>outlet</b> one, with 91 % and 40 % of answers, respectively); however, in this same question, the wastewater treated presented less aggressive and unpleasant odors. In a general way, the station proposed revealed efficiency in odorous compounds stabilization by anaerobic biological degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was aimed {{to choose the}} most appropriate aquatic plant in high capacity as grown in small wetland for community wastewater treatment, they were Typha angustifolia Linn., Cyperus corymbosus Rottb., and Canna indica Linn. The small wetland, sometimes called vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW), has been designated on 100 -m long, 5 -m wide and 0. 75 -m deep in size in which four-hole pipes were laid {{down at the bottom}} for releasing some treated wastewater as <b>effluent</b> through the <b>outlet</b> to the storage reservoir. There must be paved the gravel on the bottom up to the level of 5 -cm height and overtopping with sand about 15 cm that be followed by 30 -cm mixed soil (soil: sand equivalent to 3 : 1). All selected aquatic plant species were planted in small wetland before flowing community wastewater until soil at saturated level for first week and about 30 cm during second week up to the maximum age of plants. The choosing aquatic plant species were only depended on the high efficiency of wastewater treatment. The most probable aquatic plant was selected on Typha as the first priority for high wastewater treatment efficiency, Canna the second, and more or less efficiency for the others. Fortunately, Typha has been grown well in everywhere, particularly flat wetland in central, west, east and down north o...|$|R
40|$|The procoagulant {{subcellular}} {{matrix of}} stimulated endothelial cells that contains tissue factor (TF) {{was used to}} investigate the mechanism by which TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits thrombin formation initiated by TF/factor VIIa (FVIIa) under flow conditions. Purified coagulation factors VII, X, and V and prothrombin were perfused at a wall shear rate of 100 s- 1 through a flow chamber containing a coverslip covered with matrix of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This resulted in a TF- and FVII-dependent FXa and thrombin generation as measured in the <b>effluent</b> at the <b>outlet</b> of the system. Inhibition of this TF/FVIIa-triggered thrombin formation by TFPI purified from plasma was dependent {{on the amount of}} TF present on the endothelial cell matrix. The rate of prothrombinase assembly and steady-state levels of thrombin formation were decreased by TFPI. Because persistent albeit decreased steady-state levels of thrombin formation occurred in the presence of TFPI, we conclude that plasma-TFPI does not inhibit FXa present in the prothrombinase complex. The addition of FIX and FVIII to perfusates containing FVII and FX increased the FXa generation on endothelial matrices, and counteracted the inhibition of thrombin formation on endothelial cell matrices by TFPI. Our data provide further evidence for the hypothesis that the rapid inactivation of TF/FVIIa by TFPI in combination with the absence of either FVIII or FIX causes the bleeding tendency of patients with hemophilia A or...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{regenerate}} clinoptilolite natural zeolite by air stripping followed by removal of ammonium from aqueous solutions. The research was carried out in continuous system. The characteristics of graded clinoptilolite from Semnan (one of the central provinces in Iran) mines were determined and then regeneration tests were done by contacting of 1 N NaCl solution with given weights of ammonium saturated zeolite. Then the brine of column was transferred to the air stripping column for regeneration. The pH of brine solution before entrance to a stripping column was increased to 11. Air stripped ammonia from the brine was converted to the ammonium ion by using acid scrubber. The <b>outlet</b> <b>effluent</b> from stripping column was collected for reuse. The results showed that the cation exchange capacities were 17. 31 to 18. 38 mg NH 4 +/g of zeolite weight. Regeneration efficiency of zeolite by NaCl solution and air stripping was in the range of 92 %- 97 % under various operational conditions. However, the efficiency of acid absorption of released ammonia in stripping process was 55 % with a major rejection of the surplus ammonia to the atmosphere. It could be concluded that the method studied may be considered as an advanced and supplementary process for treating effluents of aqueous solution and fishponds in existing treatment plants...|$|R
40|$|Most {{literature}} contains Hydrochloric acid (HCl) carbonate acidizing experiments {{performed on}} short (2 - 6 inch) cores. These cores do not accurately represent reservoir conditions, as spent acid is not propagated for any appreciable distance {{along the length}} of the sample. In this work, HCl injection experiments are performed on both short (6 inch) and long (20 inch) calcite cores to investigate the pore volume to breakthrough (PVBT) behavior. PVBT is defined as the volume of acid necessary to propagate the wormhole network from the inlet to the outlet of the core sample, divided by the pore volume of the core. HCl (5 and 15 percent by weight) injection core flood experiments were performed on 6 inch and 20 inch calcite (Indiana Limestone) cores. The cores were CAT scanned before and after acid injection to observe wormhole propagation. Core <b>outlet</b> <b>effluent</b> samples were collected and their calcium concentration was measured using Inductively- Coupled Plasma. Results from core flood experiments show an increased PVBT for 20 inch cores compared to the 6 inch samples. Results from CAT scan experiments show enlarged worm-holing and face dissolution on the 20 inch cores compared to the 6 inch cores, due to increased acid spending at the same acid concentration, flow rate, and injection temperature. Results from experiments performed at various flowrates indicate the existence of an optimum injection rate for 20 inch cores, just as in 6 inch cores. This study summarizes and explains the results obtained from the aforementioned experiments...|$|R
