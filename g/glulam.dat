40|$|According {{to the act}} for {{promotion}} of use of wood in public buildings, small-scale constructions are desired to be built of wooden materials. In addition, considering the act about long life quality housing, future wood constructions should have easy-renovation system. In those social situations, {{it could be said}} that wooden frame structure has an advantage in the room re-arrangement like steel constructions. Therefore several moment resisting joints developed for heavy timber structures have been improved and put to practical usages in recent detached houses and small-scale constructions. In practical structural design, the horizontal stiffness of wooden portal frame structure tends to be insufficient when it is designed with general-produced medium-sized <b>glulams.</b> One of the reasons is that most mechanical joints have low rigidity. According to the annual meeting reports of Japanese Architecture Institute {{for the past ten years}} [1], the studies on moment resisting joints of which cross section sizes of the beam were ranged from 120 x 300 to 150 x 450 mm, reported that the rigidity of mechanical joints were less than 2000 kN㺃m/rad, on the other hand, that of several glued joints achieved more than 5000 kN㺃 m/rad. Then requirements for rigidity and strength of joint were simulated by an imaginary three-story wooden structure consisting of 6 m span portal frame at 2 m interval in the first floor.

It compared two options for a roof structure of a new airport in Oslo, Norway - steel beams and <b>glulam</b> spruce wood beams. The life cycle greenhouse gas emission is lower for the <b>glulam</b> beams. If they are burned {{at the end of their}} service life, more energy can be recovered than was used to manufacture them. If they are landfilled, the <b>glulam</b> beams are a worse alternative than steel because of the methane emission. A more recent study by Chalmers University of Technology was not so optimistic. Nevertheless, it showed that while the absolute greenhouse emissions are strongly dependent on the method used to calculate them, the environmental profile of <b>glulam</b> is typically as good or better than steel in an example structural application.The cost of the <b>glulam</b> beams is slightly lower than the steel beams.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glulam</b> optimizes the {{structural}} {{values of a}} renewable resource - wood. Because of their composition, large <b>glulam</b> members can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} smaller trees harvested from second- and third-growth forests and plantations. <b>Glulam</b> provides the strength and versatility of large wood members without relying on the old growth-dependent solid-sawn timbers. [...] As with other engineered wood products, it reduces the overall amount of wood used when compared to solid sawn timbers by diminishing the negative impact of knots and other small defects in each component board. [...] <b>Glulam</b> has much lower embodied energy than reinforced concrete and steel, although of course it does entail more embodied energy than solid timber. However, the laminating process allows timber to be used for much longer spans, heavier loads, and complex shapes. <b>Glulam</b> is two-thirds the weight of steel and one sixth the weight of concrete - the embodied energy to produce it is six times less than the same suitable strength of steel. <b>Glulam</b> can be manufactured to a variety of straight and curved configurations so it offers architects artistic freedom without sacrificing structural requirements.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new building tools and methods is an important motor in construction history. In the years after World War II, the world of building witnessed an unprecedented expansion in materials (like: plastics, aluminium, asbestos), technologies (like: pre- and post-tensioning of concrete, lightweight and tensile construction, <b>glulams,</b> space frames) and methods (in design, calculation and organization). During post-war reconstruction and in later years, these new tools developed through technological and scientific research, enabled new ways to design and build to both architects and engineers, aiming at greater efficiency, lower cost, better control and planning, safer procedures and buildings, … often with great success. In the historiography of construction, new tools and methods are considered as important actors in progress, yet the description of their development is most often restricted to their immediate effects and first-time uses {{in the world of}} building. Nevertheless, the introduction of new tools and methods also affected the building design professions more profoundly. In several cases, they triggered a questioning of professional demarcation, skills, knowledge, training and the division of roles in design – a discussion rising in the fifties and a returning issue in magazines and books until the mid-seventies. Moreover, through this questioning, the very nature and authority of design was interrogated and with it, new concepts on architecture, engineering, building and their relationship were forwarded, including a re-consideration of their societal position. Several questions can be raised in this context, both general and aiming at specific cases. Does the appreciation for the new tools and methods, or for technology and science in general, change over the years? Who is involved in the new design situations and {{what is the role of}} the building industries or “new” profiles such as lighting engineers or HVAC specialists? Is the impact of the new tools and methods steered and promoted? Do post-war design cultures and the {{development of}} tools and methods interact and if so, how? Is the impact of the new tools and methods on the designing professions and on the ideals of the disciplines acknowledged, and if so, how and by whom?This session calls for papers exploring the profound impact of new tools and methods in the world of building in the post-war era. It seeks to critically bridge between construction history, the history of technology, architecture history and design and building practice. Papers highlighting the interaction between disciplines, through their tools, their actors and/or their ideals are especially encouraged. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes {{have caused}} many {{disasters}} along with multiple casualties throughout history. Nevertheless, as science has evolved {{and a better}} understanding of the nature of earthquakes has been achieved, new methods of designing building have developed. Human safety has always been and is the biggest concern, and that is what makes seismic design so important when designing any building. Earthquake Engineering is going to be the first topic addressed in this thesis, spanning from the most basic seismic concepts to how a seismic equivalent force is applied to any building. Plate tectonics theory is briefly explained as well as the significance of the Richter scale. These are general seismic concepts that can be omitted for structural design purposes but convenient to know and understand. The biggest focus on the Earthquake Engineering chapter is explaining the fundamentals of structural dynamics and how this leads to the seismic equations provided by current codes. The different degrees of structural dynamics complexity are exposed and commented on (linear vs non-linear) and a thorough explanation of all the different factors taken into consideration by current codes are explained in this section. The expected substantial growth of the world’s population calls for a wise use of our resources when it comes down to building structures. Wood is a renewable material and the best option from an environmental point of view, which is why special attention to its structural and environmental properties should be paid. This thought brings us to the next core section of this thesis, which is wood engineering. This section starts explaining the very basic properties of wood and how they are taken advantage of in wood engineering. The two most basic types of wood products, which are sawn lumber and <b>Glulams,</b> are analyzed. Their fabrication processes, as well as their grades, species types and adjustment factors for structural design are going to be investigated. The last core section is the Case Study. All of the concepts and ideas exposed up to this point are combined together in a one story framed wood building. The main gravity wood members are designed using the principles exposed in the wood engineering section. The last part of the Case Study focuses on the first core chapter, which is Earthquake Engineering; a seismic analysis based on the principles and methods explained in this chapter is performed. All of the results are well documented and analyzed. The thesis ends providing a list of conclusions commenting on the most important aspects that have been learned. Special attention is given to the importance of having a good understanding of how seismic analysis works and to learn how we can use wood in applications where we would typically use concrete or steel as our structural resistant materia...|$|R
