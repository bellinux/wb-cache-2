5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} demoralised and tired Greeks were {{no match for}} the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides.

5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of toponymy and language is unequivocal.

Norn was also spoken in Shetland and evidence for Pictish elements in placenames is virtually non-existent, the three island names of Fetlar, Unst and Yell excepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{report cards}} for these {{operations}} are highly controversial. Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were ineffectual. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that these operations inflicted damage and caused confusion and anxiety among the Israelis, who diverted resources to counter these threats, while reservists were slowed down. One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa'iqa.|$|E

5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.|$|E

5|$|A 1935 {{article in}} the Montreal Gazette, meanwhile, stated that the {{original}} September Morn had yet {{to go to the}} United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had been interested in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so. Although {{it is possible that the}} original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that reproductions did.|$|E

5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that the Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> that Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, {{they might have been}} reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
