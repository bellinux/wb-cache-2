50|$|The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted {{to amend}} and codify the law {{relating}} to <b>intestate</b> or unwilled <b>succession,</b> among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. The Act lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and succession into one Act. The Hindu woman's limited estate is abolished by the Act. Any property possessed by a Hindu female {{is to be}} held by her absolute property and she is given full power {{to deal with it}} and dispose it of by will as she likes. Parts of this Act was amended in 2005 by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the time}} of Bracton, despite the {{generality}} of the writ, the bailor of a chattel could only bring this action against the bailee of the chattel, or those who represent the bailee by testate or <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> [...] Only two actions were available. [...] The plaintiff could claim, [...] "I lost the goods and you found them."; or [...] "I bailed the chattel to you." [...] The first of these was called detinue sur trover.|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{our sources}} for this major reform are [...] "meagre and late", {{so that it}} [...] "is {{difficult}} to tell what Julianus in fact did." [...] A key feature of the Praetor's Edict was its organisational scheme, {{the order in which}} the various subjects of the law are presented. This sequence had obviously [...] "grown up gradually from one generation to another. How far Julian's final redaction departs from the hitherto traditional arrangement we have not the means of judging save in some exceptional cases." [...] Nonetheless, certain changes in the Edict wrought by Iulianus are well known, e.g., regarding <b>intestate</b> <b>succession,</b> that affecting shares of inheritance among children in the Bonorum possessio unde liberi. Moreover, his other alterations do not seem problematic. It was this received [...] "edictal order of topics" [...] that was already widely used in juristic works of the Principate, during the classical period of Roman Law. Among Roman jurists, [...] "Julian's work on the Edict was traditionally regarded as of great importance [...] he is repeatedly spoken of as compositor, conditor, ordinator of the Edict." ...|$|E

The following Chapters Two, Three and Four examine the relevant current Czech legislation of inheritance titles.

50|$|Introduced by Q. Voconius Saxa {{with support}} from Cato the Elder, Voconius being tribune {{of the people in}} that year, this law {{prohibited}} those who owned property valued at 100,000 asses (or perhaps sesterces) from making a woman their heir. This particular limit was not arbitrary but was apparently the traditional property qualification for admission to the highest class in the Comitia Centuriata, and thus the minimum qualification for the Equestrian Order. In addition, it prohibited extraordinary legacies in a will of a greater value than the inheritance of the ordinary heirs. This intention of this legislation according to Gellius was sumptuary in that it limited the wealth available to women, who were presumed to expend it on useless luxury goods. The law only applied to inheritances by testament and did not affect the <b>intestate</b> law of <b>succession</b> of women, although later this was limited to inheriting to the third degree.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act is important, one cannot {{discount}} {{case law}} when determining {{the rules of}} <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> If and when the RCLSA is promulgated into law, it, too, will be relevant for determining South Africa's intestate-succession laws.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act of 1987 {{instituted a}} much simpler system of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession,</b> revoking common-law rules and all {{statutory}} adaptations in their entirety. The <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act, {{together with the}} Children’s Act, extended the categories of persons who may be heirs who take in intestacy. For example, all natural persons, irrespective of whether they are adopted or extra-marital, or conceived by artificial insemination, or born {{as a result of}} a surrogacy arrangement, nowadays have the capacity to inherit.|$|E
50|$|The law of {{intestacy}} {{was virtually}} codified by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act, which came into force on 18 March 1988. Before that, the South African system of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> {{had to be}} construed {{from a variety of}} common-law and statutory rules. The law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> is rooted in the legislation of the States of Holland: the Political Ordinance of 1 April 1580, as clarified and amended by the Interpretation Ordinance of 13 May 1594 and Section 3 of the Placaat of 18 December 1599.|$|E

5000|$|Until recently, the {{application}} of the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act was regulated on a racial basis. Certain intestate estates of African people were distributed according to the [...] "official customary law," [...] as entrenched in the Black Administration Act and its regulations, while the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act applied {{to the rest of the}} population. The Black Administration Act, and the Regulations passed thereunder, provided that the estates of black people who died without leaving a valid will sometimes devolved according to “Black law and custom.” This meant, inter alia, that the reforms introduced by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act did not apply to spouses married in terms of African customary law. As far as children were concerned, the parallel system of African customary law of succession perpetuated discrimination against adopted, extra marital and even female children.|$|E

To rectify the unconstitutionality, the court read the words [...] "or partner in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support" [...] into section 1(1) of the Act after the word [...] "spouse." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{manner in}} which assets are {{distributed}} depends on whether the deceased has left a valid will or other valid document containing testamentary provisions, such as an antenuptial contract. If the deceased has not left a valid will or valid document containing testamentary provisions, the deceased dies intestate; similarly, if the deceased leaves a valid will which does not dispose of all property, there is an intestacy as to the portion not disposed of. In the event of intestacy, the assets are distributed in a definite order of preference among the heirs, as stipulated by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act. Until recently, the Act (and its common-law precursor) existed side-by-side with a statutorily-regulated customary-law regime of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession,</b> applied on a racial basis, but this was brought to an end when the Constitutional Court, in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, made the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act applicable to all.|$|E
