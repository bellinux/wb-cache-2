25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} fixed interest rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a fixed interest rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.|$|E

Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually.

The United States Department of Justice and Barclays officially agreed that [...] "the manipulation of the submissions affected the fixed rates on some occasions".

They often combine more than one contract, [...] "which individually may be Shariah-compliant" [...] but when combined [...] "may defeat the objective of the shariah". Furthermore, the sukuk rate of return is often [...] "tied" [...] to the Libor (London <b>interbank</b> <b>offered</b> <b>rate)</b> or Euribor (euro <b>interbank</b> <b>offered</b> <b>rate)</b> interest rate [...] "rather than to the underlying business" [...] that the sukuk is financing.

It is found that the active involvement of HKMA in the interbank market does have an impact on not only the levels but also the volatility of the HIBOR. However, the effectiveness of interest rate as a means to sustain the HK$/US$ peg rate is much less obvious...|$|R
40|$|The {{likelihood}} of extreme daily changes in London <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>rates</b> are estimated using the peaks-over-threshold method developed from extreme value theory. Value {{at risk and}} expected shortfall for high quantiles are produced for {{the left and right}} tails of the distributions for each maturity. The Generalized Pareto distribution of the peaks-over-threshold method is found to be unsuitable for modeling exceedances above a high threshold for samples of simple daily changes in the LIBOR. When the series are transformed to logarithmic daily changes, extreme value analysis proceeds smoothly and yields useful information about the relative frequency or magnitudes of extreme events. The main consequence of this is that the risk statistics associated with a given change in the LIBOR depend on the initial rate level; at higher (lower) interest rates, changes of a given size are more (less) likely to occur. ...|$|R
