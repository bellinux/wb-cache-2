Instead, Reyat pleaded guilty on 29 April 1986 to possession of an <b>explosive</b> <b>substance</b> and possession of an unregistered firearm. His sentence was a light $2,000 fine. Just three months later, Reyat moved his family from Canada to Coventry, near Birmingham, in the UK. Reyat was soon hired at a Jaguar factory where he worked for nearly two years.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of the explosion was quickly established as a building used to store refined sugar prior to packaging it and two of three [...] tall, [...] thick reinforced concrete storage silos adjacent to it, as pictured. According to Imperial Sugar CEO John Sheptor, the accumulated sugar dust likely acted like gunpowder. Sheptor, {{who was in the}} plant {{at the time of the}} explosion, survived only because he was protected by a firewall. Heavy equipment had to be used to shore up the partially collapsed structure before firefighters could enter it to search for victims. Within 24 hours, the <b>explosive</b> <b>substance</b> was identified as sugar dust.|$|E
