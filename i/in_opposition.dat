5|$|After years <b>in</b> <b>opposition,</b> in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years <b>in</b> <b>opposition</b> and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E

50|$|The Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>in</b> the Senate is not {{necessarily}} from the same party as the <b>opposition</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons. From 1993 until 2003 the Leader of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>in</b> the Senate was a Progressive Conservative despite the fact the Progressive Conservatives were not the Official <b>Opposition</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons. The Official <b>Opposition</b> <b>in</b> the Commons; (Bloc Québécois, Reform, Canadian Alliance) did not have Senate representation. This scenario repeated itself following {{the results of the}} 2011 election that saw the Liberal Party lose Official <b>Opposition</b> status <b>in</b> the House to the New Democratic Party — since the NDP has no representation in the Senate (and favours abolition of the chamber) the Liberals would form the Official <b>Opposition</b> <b>in</b> the Senate.|$|R
