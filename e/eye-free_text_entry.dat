40|$|Abstract. Proposed is a {{new method}} to enter text using a reduced keypad, as is {{typically}} found on telephones, with particular extensions for one with a display window above it, as is typically found on mobile phones. In this method each {{of the most commonly}} used characters is entered by selecting two keys in succession. The so-called KC-method may be programmed into a conventional mobile phone without any modification of hardware. The superiority of KC over traditional multi-tap lies in the elimination of key tap time-out, uniform <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rate and appealing visual feedback during the entry process.

In inviscid <b>text</b> <b>entry,</b> it is the user's creativity that is the text-creation bottleneck rather than the <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> interface. The inviscid rate is estimated at 67 wpm while current mobile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> methods are typically 20 - 40 wpm. In this workshop, participants will discuss and demonstrate early work into novel methods that allow very rapid <b>text</b> <b>entry,</b> even if such methods currently are quite error-prone.

Many new mobile phones are equipped with a QWERTY keypad; new methods to surpass the QWERTY performance are also being developed. This thesis compares user performance of virtual QWERTY keypad to MessagEase. MessagEase uses 9 keys and can therefore be used even on very small touch displays. 9 characters are entered with tapping and the rest with a tap-and-slide gesture. An experiment was conducted with 10 participants transcribing text with both <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> techniques. The experiment consisted of three sessions. In each session, the participants transcribed 30 phrases in total - 15 phrases using each <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> technique. Responses to the System Usability Scale (SUS) for each <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> technique and informal interview data were also collected. From a Repeated-measures analysis of variance a significant effect of the <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> method on <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rate was seen (F 1, 19 = 47. 140, p < 0. 0001). The effect of the session (i. e. learning) was also statistically significant (F 2, 18 = 3. 631, p = 0. 047). The interaction of the session and method was also statistically significant (F 2, 18 = 10. 286, p = 0. 001) indicating different learning rates.
