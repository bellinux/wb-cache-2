40|$|The Russian River <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation (“Frost Protection Rule”) {{states that}} “any {{diversion}} {{of water from}} the Russian River stream system, including the pumping of hydraulically connected groundwater, for purposes of frost protection” must be diverted in accordance with an approved “water demand management program” (WDMP), or the diversion “is an unreasonable method of diversion and use and a violation of Water Code section 100. ” The California State Water Resources Control Board (“State Water Board”) adopted the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule on September 20, 2011. Litigation over the rule culminated in the decision in Light et al. v. State Water Res. Control Bd., 226 Cal. App. 4 th 1463 (2014), which confirmed that the State Water Board has authority to adopt quasi-legislative rules for the reasonable use and reasonable manner of water diversion. The court also reiterated that the reasonable use doctrine applies to all water rights—including riparian and pre- 1914 appropriators. Finally, the court approved the State Water Board’s reliance on industry-led consortiums of water right holders to assist in the management of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> program through the adoption of the WDMPs. Readers of the Light decision could be forgiven for assuming that the case presented a classic conflict between heavy-handed regulators, environmental interests, and farmers. As the rule-making proceeded, there were moments of conflict and some grape growers eventually filed a lawsuit. However, there was also a great deal of common ground between others in the winegrape industry, State Water Board members, and the conservation community. One of the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule’s untold stories is the tremendous amount of progress that was made “on the ground” while the rule was in development and delayed by litigation. The winegrape industry deserves credit for its actions, and the State Water Board and wildlife agencies deserve credit for bringing the issue forward. The progress that has happened on the ground augurs well {{for the future of the}} effort, and begs the question whether the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule is already a success...|$|R

40|$|In {{areas of}} {{seasonal}} frost, frost susceptibility composed by frost heaving {{during the winter}} and thaw softening during the spring {{is one of the}} most dangerous phenomenon for transportation, road and railway infrastructure. Therefore, the need for <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer becomes imperative. The purpose of <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer is to prevent frost from penetrating down through the pavement and into the sub-soils. Frost susceptible soils under the road can be cause damages on the roads or other structures due to frost heave or reduced capacity characteristics thaw period. "Frost heave" is the term given to the upwards displacement of the ground surface caused by the formation of ice within soils or aggregates (Rempel et al., 2004). Nowadays in Scandinavia the most common material used in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer in the pavement structure of roads and in the ballast of the railway tracks are coarse-grain crushed rocks aggregates. Based on the capillary rise, the mechanics of frost heave phenomenon is based on the interaction between aggregates and water, as suggested by Konrad and Lemieux in 2005 that said that the fraction of material below the 0. 063 mm sieve for coarse-grained soils must be controlled so as to reduce the sensitivity to frost heave. The study conducted in this thesis project is divided in two parts: - the analysis of the coarse grained aggregates used in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer in Norway; - the analysis of the frost heave phenomenon in the laboratory under known boundary conditions, through the use of the most widely used method, the frost heave test, in” closed system” (without access of water). ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{will discuss}} the Light case from the {{perspective}} of my firm’s vineyardist clients—including our understanding of the Reasonable Use Doctrine and its application to the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation. The underlying premise of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation is the theory that reductions in streamflow caused by <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> diversions cause or contribute to stranding of juvenile salmonids in the exposed gravel banks of the rivers and streams in the Russian River watershed. One of the key issues in Light was whether good science supports this theory. From the perspective of my vineyardist clients, the State Board relied on very weak science in support of this theory. As always, perspective is crucial in determining what level of science is necessary to support a regulation that will impose major costs on vineyardists in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. From the perspective of my clients, there ought to be sound science underlying the relationship between frost diversions and salmonid strandings before imposing any water use regulation. In contrast, members of the environmental and academic community seem less interested in examining the science and more inclined to accept the State Board’s conclusion tying frost diversions to salmonid strandings—at least in my conversations with these folks. The Background section presents information on <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> and the fisheries issues that led to enactment of section 862 of title 23 of the California Code of Regulations (“Section 862 ”).

40|$|Abstract – Vineyards are a {{dominant}} feature of many landscapes in Mediterranean-climate regions. We {{examined the effects}} of streamflow declines, associated with vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> on benthic-macroinvertebrate communities at three sites along three small streams in the Mediterranean-climate region of Northern California. One site was heavily affected by water withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> the other two were not. In addition, we examined relationships between vineyard coverage and benthic-macroinvertebrate community response using data from 59 sampling events at 39 sites along 35 small streams in Napa County, California. We tested three a priori hypotheses in terms of the response of biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates to high vineyard coverage: (1) proportion of individuals with semi-voltine (i. e., one generation every 2 years) life cycles would be lower compared to those with uni- and multi-voltine cycles, (2) proportion of individuals able to undergo diapause would be higher, and (3) proportion of individuals with the ability to burrow into the substrate would be higher. In the three-site study, we found that vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> coincided with consistently lower values in both the benthic-macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for Northern California streams and the ratio of Ephemeroptera–Plecoptera–Trichoptera to Odonata–Coleoptera–Hemiptera individuals (EPT/OCH), a metric developed for European Mediterranean streams. In the broader-scale study, we observed that vineyard-coverage levels above about 20 % coincided with lower values of the B-IBI. The semi-voltine life-cycle trait was lower above this level, whereas the diapause and burrowing traits were not affected...|$|R
