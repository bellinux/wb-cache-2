5|$|The Chronicle is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the Chronicle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E

25|$|The Afrobarometer Survey 2008 {{collected}} {{information about}} Tanzanians' {{opinions about the}} water sector. The disparity in access to safe and clean water between rural and urban areas {{is illustrated by the}} responses: 51% of urban residents were satisfied with government efforts to deliver water and sanitation services, compared to 39% in rural areas. Accordingly, the water sector is considered as a higher priority for government action by rural Tanzanians. 44% of respondents in rural areas cited water supply as one of the three most pressing issues that the government should address (for 16% it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> problem). In urban areas water supply came third behind economic and health concerns in 25% of responses. Issues of corruption in the water sector were also examined by the Survey: 4% of respondents admitted that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to government officials in order to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} the kernel {{function}} K is not crucial {{to the accuracy of}} kernel density estimators, so we use the standard multivariate normal kernel throughout: , where H plays the role of the covariance matrix. On the other hand, the {{choice of the}} bandwidth matrix H <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> factor affecting its accuracy since it controls the amount and orientation of smoothing induced. That the bandwidth matrix also induces an orientation is a basic difference between multivariate kernel density estimation from its univariate analogue since orientation is not defined for 1D kernels. This leads to the choice of the parametrisation of this bandwidth matrix. The three main parametrisation classes (in increasing order of complexity) are S, the class of positive scalars times the identity matrix; D, diagonal matrices with positive entries on the main diagonal; and F, symmetric positive definite matrices. The S class kernels have the same amount of smoothing applied in all coordinate directions, D kernels allow different amounts of smoothing in each of the coordinates, and F kernels allow arbitrary amounts and orientation of the smoothing. Historically S and D kernels are the most widespread due to computational reasons, but research indicates that important gains in accuracy can be obtained using the more general F class kernels.|$|E
500|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{source for}} the history of England in Anglo-Saxon times. Without the Chronicle and Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (the Ecclesiastical History of the English People), it would be {{impossible}} to write the history of the English from the Romans to the Norman conquest; Nicholas Howe called them [...] "the two great Anglo-Saxon works of history". It is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of Christianity, but no such records survive in their original form. Instead they were incorporated in later works, and it is thought likely that the Chronicle contains many of these. The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers, but also that recorded by earlier annalists, whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else.|$|E

In the chapter titled General Reflections in [...] "Of the Hindus", Mill wrote [...] "under the glosing {{exterior of the}} Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy". According to Mill, [...] "the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality" [...] were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and [...] "in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were [...] "dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were [...] "disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves". Both were [...] "cowardly and unfeeling". Both were [...] "in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others". And, above all, both were [...] "in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses".|$|E
2500|$|Warmachine {{is similar}} to many other {{miniature}} wargames in that each army consists of several units, each of which acts during a turn. Individual units move, attack, and may perform other actions such as repairing a warjack or using a feat. The primary mechanic unique to Warmachine {{is the use of}} focus points. Each warcaster receives a certain number of focus points each turn, which represents that warcaster's power. At the beginning of the turn, focus may be spent to pay for ongoing abilities and allocated between the warlord and 'jacks in the caster's battlegroup within their [...] "Control Area" [...] or sphere of influence - a distance based on the 'caster's focus stat. Focus allows warjacks to become more accurate and powerful by [...] "boosting" [...] their attacks, and to perform special actions called [...] "Power Attacks" [...] such as slamming a model across the battlefield with their heft or throwing an enemy model at another model. [...] Additionally warcasters can use focus to cast spells performing all manner of arcane effects from attacks, to movement bonuses, to offensive/defensive enhancements. [...] Good focus management can often be the difference between winning and losing. The warcaster <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> model on either side in the game. If a player's warcaster is killed, they lose the game, no matter how many casualties, or how much damage, they have inflicted on the enemy.|$|E
