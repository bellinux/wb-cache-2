The rate of {{disappearance of the}} ferrate(VI) ion was monitored spectrophotometrically at 505 nm using both stopped-flow and conventional instruments. The analytical techniques of gas chromatography, ion chromatography, and differential pulse polarography were used to identify and quantitate the products of these reactions. <b>Dinitrogen,</b> nitrous <b>oxide,</b> nitrite, and nitrate were the most often encountered nitrogen-containing products from these oxidations. A mass balance between the products formed and the ferrate(VI) reacted was calculated for each reductant.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{well-known}} pathogen in chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Infectivity of P. aeruginosa {{is related to the}} ability to grow under oxygen-limited conditions using the anaerobic metabolism of denitrification, in which nitrate is reduced to <b>dinitrogen</b> via nitric <b>oxide</b> (NO). Denitrification is activated by a cascade of redox-sensitive transcription factors, among which is the DNR regulator, sensitive to nitrogen oxides. To gain further insight into the mechanism of NO-sensing by DNR we have developed an Escherichia coli-based reporter system to investigate different aspects of DNR activity. In E. coli DNR responds to NO, as shown by its ability to transactivate the P. aeruginosa norCB promoter. The direct binding of DNR to the target DNA is required, since mutations in the helix-turn-helix domain of DNR and specific nucleotide substitutions in the consensus sequence of the norCB promoter abolish the transcriptional activity. Using an E coli strain deficient in haem biosynthesis, we have also confirmed that haem is required in vivo for the NO-dependent DNR activity, in agreement with the property of DNR to bind in vitro. Finally, we have shown, we believe for the first time, that DNR is able to discriminate in vivo between different diatomic signal molecules, NO and CO, both ligands of the reduced haem iron in vitro, suggesting that DNR responds specifically to NO...|$|R

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas and the major ozone depleting substance in the stratosphere. One major source of N₂O is incomplete denitrification, whereas the only known tropospheric sink of N₂O is the microbial enzyme nitrous oxide reductase. Denitrification {{is defined as the}} stepwise reduction of nitrite to <b>dinitrogen</b> via nitric <b>oxide</b> and N₂O by facultative anaerobic microorganisms. This thesis aims to elucidate the phylogenetic diversity of the N₂O reductase encoding gene nosZ and its context in microbial genomes in relation to other genes in the denitrification pathway, as well as the relative influence of plants and soil on the activity, abundance and structure of N₂O-reducing communities in the rhizosphere. Phylogenetic analysis of publicly available nosZ gene sequences revealed that its genetic diversity is divided into two distinct clades termed clade I and clade II, the latter having not been accounted for in previous studies. Newly developed molecular tools revealed that it is abundant {{in a wide range of}} environments. Analysis of microbial genomes showed that co-occurrence patterns of nosZ with other denitrification genes were neither randomly distributed among taxonomic units nor among habitats. Many genomes had truncated pathways as organisms possessing nosZII often lacked other genes involved in denitrification, suggesting these organisms may act as N₂O-sinks in the environment. Pot experiments with sunflower and barley indicated a niche differentiation between the two nosZ gene variants, as nosZI showed an affinity for plant roots while nosZII was more abundant in the surrounding soil. However, denitrification and N₂O-production activity in soil were controlled by edaphic factors. Moreover, an intercropping experiment with cocksfoot and lucerne showed that intercropping had a negative influence on nosZII abundances on cocksfoot roots which in conjunction with phylogenetic placement of sequencing reads indicated the presence of organisms with only nosZ lacking a denitrification pathway. In conclusion, the development of new molecular tools combined with comparative genomic analysis sheds new light on the ecology of biological N₂O reduction in the rhizosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{biogeochemical}} nitrogen cycle, including nitrate reduction processes, {{is highly}} affected by human activity such as fertilization and ammonia deposition caused by fossil fuel burning. Consequently, gaining {{a better understanding}} about the ecophysiology of nitrate-reducing microbial communities is crucial for inferring the impact of anthropogenic nitrogen input. Different nitrate-reducing pathways {{compete with each other}} for the electron acceptor nitrate: Denitrifiers reduce nitrate to <b>dinitrogen</b> and nitrous <b>oxide</b> while dissimilatory nitrate reducers reduce nitrate to ammonium. The outcome of this competition has important environmental consequences: denitrification removes fixed nitrogen from the ecosystem, while dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA) keeps fixed nitrogen bioavailable. Although a lot of studies have been performed on this topic, no conclusive factors responsible for the dominance of one or the other process could be identified so far. In this thesis, the competition between nitrate reduction pathways was addressed by combining continuous culture incubations of natural microbial communities with stable isotope labeling and metagenomics, complemented with metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics in order to gain insight into the identity, function and interaction of the enriched microbial populations. To {{be able to make the}} best use of the obtained metagenomic data a new metagenomic binning procedure was developed. Before the competition between two different nitrate reduction pathways was studied, the relationship between functional and compositional stability over time within one nitrate reduction pathway was investigated: In a heterotrophic denitrifying microbial community, enriched from a marine intertidal flat, strong community dynamics were occurring under constant conditions and during stable conversion of substrates. A stable metabolic interaction between the denitrifying populations and co-enriched fermenting microbes persisted throughout the experiment unaffected by the ongoing population dynamics. This indicated that functional stability was independent of the community composition. Apparently, only the persistence of the overall metabolic potential was important to maintain functional stability. This suggested that stochastic as well as deterministic processes are responsible for the observed community composition. Once the functional stability of denitrification was confirmed and interactions with other microbial guilds were known the competition between DNRA and denitrification was addressed. Several parallel continuous culture incubations that differed in one condition but were otherwise constant led to the identification of the generation time as most important control on the competition between DNRA and denitrification. The organic carbon to nitrate ratio and the kind of electron acceptor supplied (nitrate or nitrite) were identified as further controlling factors that together with the generation time discriminated between the two pathways. The metabolic interaction between nitrate- reducing and fermenting populations was stable under both pathways. One quarter of the nitrate reduction was coupled to the oxidation of sulfide, which was produced in the enrichment culture by microbial sulfate reduction, constituting a strong link between the nitrogen and sulfur cycle. All in all, this thesis provides new insights into the ecophysiology of microbial nitrate reducers by unraveling the driving forces of the competition between different nitrate reduction pathways and by revealing important metabolic interactions with other microbial guilds...|$|R

Cell extracts of Desulfitobacterium strain PCE 1 grown with tetrachloroethene as electron acceptor showed no dehalogenase activity with 3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxyphenylacetate (Cl-OH-phenylacetate) and other ortho-chlorophenolic compounds in an in vitro assay. Extracts of cells that were grown with Cl-OH-phenylacetate as electron acceptor dechlorinated tetrachloroethene at 10 f the dechlorination rate of Cl-OH-phenylacetate. In both cell extracts dechlorination was inhibited {{by the addition of}} 1 -iodopropane and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>oxide,</b> inhibitors of cobalamin-containing enzymes. The enzymes responsible for tetrachloroethene and Cl-OH-phenylacetate dechlorination were partially purified. A 100 -fold enriched fraction of chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase was obtained that mainly contained a protein with a subunit size of 48 kDa. The characteristics of this enzyme are {{similar to that of the}} chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase of D. dehalogenans. After partial purification of the tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase, a fraction was obtained that also contained a 48 -kDa protein, but the N-terminal sequence showed no similarity with that of the chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase sequence or with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of tetra- and trichloroethene reductive dehalogenase of Desulfitobacterium strain TCE 1. These results provide strong evidence that two different enzymes are responsible for tetrachloroethene and chlorophenol dechlorination in Desulfitobacterium strain PCE 1.

The measurements were made on a laboratory fume hood in a chemical laboratory. There were no other fume hoods in the laboratory, and the measurements were made without interference from persons entering or leaving the laboratory or walking about in it. A tracer gas method was used with the concentration of <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> (N 2 O) being recorded by a Foxboro Miran 101 infra-red gas analyser. In parallel with the tracer gas measurements, the air velocity through the face opening was also measured, as was the control signal to the damper controlling the air flow rate. The measurements show an increased outward leakage of tracer gas from the fume hood if the air flow rate is not re-established within 1 – 2 s after the sash is opened. If the delay exceeds 3 s the safety function is temporarily defeated. The measurements were made under virtually ideal conditions. Under more typical conditions, the fume hood could be exposed to various other external perturbations, which means that the control system should re-establish the correct exhaust flow more quickly than indicated by the measurement results obtained under these almost ideal conditions. # 200...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the rising concentrations of methane, <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> and carbon dioxide since the pre-industrial era upon the chemistry of the mesosphere. We use for calculations our global 3 D-model COMMA-IAP designed for the exploration of the MLT-region and particularly the extended mesopause region. In order to get approximated data of the solar Lyman-α flux back to the pre-industrial time, we derived a quadratic fit using the sunspot number available since 1749 as the only solar proxy for the Lyman-α flux before 1947. The Lyman-α flux values are employed to determine the water vapor dissociation rate. The water vapor trend analysis utilizes estimated methane trends since the pre-industrial era. An unsolved problem for the model calculations consists of the water vapor mixing ratio at the hygropause during the time range of trend calculation. We assume that the hygropause was dryer at the pre-industrial time than currently. As a consequence of the methane oxidation, the middle atmosphere became more humid according to the rising methane concentration, but depending on height and with a small time delay of few years. The solar influence on the water vapor mixing ratio is insignificant below about 80 km within summery high latitudes, but it becomes increasingly more important above this altitude. The growing water vapor concentration increases the hydrogen radical concentration and reduces the mesospheric ozone. A second region of stronger ozone decrease is located {{in the vicinity of the}} stratopause. Increasing CO 2 concentration enhances slightly the concentration of CO in the mesosphere, but its influence upon the chemistry is small and its main effect is connected with a cooling of the upper atmosphere.

Precursor sample prepared with thiourea, releases first water endothermically from room temperature to 190 degrees C, carbonyl sulfide (COS) from 120 to 280 degrees C in two stages, and ammonia (NH 3) from 170 to 450 degrees C in three steps. Evolution of CO 2, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>oxide,</b> as of oxidation products, (N 2 O), as of oxidation products, occurs between 150 and 220, 180 and 330, 280 and 450 degrees C, respectively. Exothermic DTA peaks at 170, 220, and 310 degrees C correspond to the maximum rate of CO 2, SO 2, and N 2 O evolution, respectively. The fourth exothermic heat effect at 430 degrees C is {{probably due to the}} simultaneous burning out of residual carbonaceous-species, solid-state oxidation of residual sulfureous and/or sulfurous species, and transformation of amorphous titania into anatase. Titanium-oxo-sulfate formation at 500 degrees C has been confirmed by FTIR. Furthermore, evolution of sulfur dioxide reoccurs again in a definite step between 550 and 800 degrees C, indicating the significant extent of previous sulfate formation processes.
