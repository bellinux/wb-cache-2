40|$|<b>Inhalation</b> of <b>anthrax</b> causes fatal bacteremia, {{indicating}} a meager host immune response. We previously showed that anthrax lethal toxin (LT) paralyzes neutrophils, {{a major component}} of innate immunity. Here, we have found that LT also inhibits actin-based motility of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. LT inhibition of actin assembly is mediated by blockade of Hsp 27 phosphorylation, and can be reproduced by treating cells with the p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB 203580. Nonphosphorylated Hsp 27 inhibits Listeria actin-based motility in cell extracts, and binds to and sequesters purified actin monomers. Phosphorylation of Hsp 27 reverses these effects. RNA interference knockdown of Hsp 27 blocks LT inhibition of Listeria actin-based motility. Rescue with wild-type Hsp 27 accelerates Listeria speed in knockdown cells, whereas introduction of Hsp 27 mutants incapable of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation causes slowing down. We propose that Hsp 27 facilitates actin-based motility through a phosphorylation cycle that shuttles actin monomers to regions of new actin filament assembly. Our findings provide a previously unappreciated mechanism for LT virulence, and emphasize a central role for p 38 MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp 27 in actin-based motility and innate immunity...|$|R

Anthrax immune globulin intravenous (AIGIV) is a candidate immunotherapeutic that contains neutralizing antibodies against protective antigen (PA), a component of anthrax toxins. We evaluated the interac-tion between AIGIV and BioThrax (anthrax vaccine adsorbed) in rabbits.

40|$|History Anthrax {{has been}} known since ancient times. Besides some {{references}} in the Old Testament, {{there is evidence of}} plagues in ancient Egypt, as well as descriptions of the disease by the Roman poet Virgil. Etiology Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, unmovable, aerobic, gram-positive rods. It forms spores, which can survive for years in the environment. Pathogenesis Capsular polypeptide and anthrax toxin are the principal virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax toxin consists of three proteins called protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor. It is thought that the inflammatory mediator - lethal factor is stored within the macrophage during the early stage of infection. It is rapidly released in large amounts into the blood stream and once the threshold for lysis is reached, it may be the cause of sudden death. Epidemiology Grass-eating animals are usually infected by the bacilli from grass and ground. The disease is transmitted to people by contact with the sick animals or their products, such as wool skin, meat etc. Clinical features Two clinical forms exist: outer cutaneous and inner, including <b>inhalation</b> and gastrointestinal <b>anthrax.</b> While cutaneous anthrax is easily cured, the inner forms have high mortality rates. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis The diagnosis is easily established in cutaneous cases, characterized by black eschar. Severe intoxication and collapse during the course of bronchopneumonia or hemorrhagic enteritis should arise suspicion of anthrax. Therapy Hospitalization of patients is mandatory. Bacillus anthracis is susceptible to a number of antibiotics, including penicillin, erythromycin tetracyclines, cephalosporins etc. Prevention General veterinary prevention including vaccination of livestock and control of products is very important. The vaccine consists of anthrax bacillus that is attenuated. The endangered population, such as animal workers and military personnel should be vaccinated. Annual schedule of booster immunization must be maintained. Anthrax as a biological weapon Anthrax has been developed as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} since World War I. During accidental release from a biological warfare factory in the farmer Soviet Union, 68 people died. The ease of laboratory production and its dissemination via aerosol led to its adoption by terrorists, as shown by recent happenings in the USA. Conclusion A good knowledge of anthrax, its transmission and potentials as a biological weapon is essential for timely prevention and protection...|$|R

Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) may protect against cutaneous and <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax.</b> However, this vaccine is only used for at-risk adults before exposure to anthrax and has not been approved for use after exposure. Infections with B. anthracis can be treated with β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, and others which are active against Gram-positive bacteria. Penicillin-resistant B. anthracis can be treated with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or tetracycline antibiotics such as doxycycline.|$|E

50|$|The vaccine {{efficacy}} of AVA in humans was initially established by Philip S. Brachman of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) {{in a controlled}} study undertaken between 1954 and 1959. The study field sites were four wool-sorting mills in the northeastern United States where employees were sometimes exposed to anthrax spores {{in the course of}} their work. Over the five years, 379 vaccinees were compared against 414 unvaccinated control subjects. There were 23 cases among controls (5 of them <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax)</b> compared with 3 cases among vaccinated (0 inhalation cases). The vaccine was judged to have a 92.5% {{vaccine efficacy}} against all types of anthrax experienced. Subsequently, there were no controlled clinical trials in humans of the efficacy of AVA due to the rarity of the condition (especially in the inhalational form) in humans and the ethical inadmissibility of conducting dangerous challenge studies in human subjects. Supportive animal challenge studies were done, however, showing that unvaccinated animals uniformly die whereas vaccinated animals are protected. About 95% of rhesus monkeys (62 of 65) survived challenge, as did 97% of rabbits (114 of 117). Guinea pigs (which are a poorer model for human anthrax than are monkeys or rabbits) showed a 22% protection (19 of 88).|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, MBPI fell {{afoul of}} FDA {{inspectors}} and reviewers when it failed inspections (1993, 1997) and received warning letters (1995) and Notices of Intention to Revoke (1997) from the agency. At issue were {{a failure to}} validate the AVA manufacturing process to the FDA’s satisfaction and various quality control failures, including reuse of expired vaccine, inadequate testing procedures, and use of lots that had failed testing. All of these developments vexed the Army, not only {{in its efforts to}} obtain sufficient vaccine for the troops, but in its desire to have AVA validated and fully licensed for prevention of inhalational anthrax, which is the expected weaponized form of the disease (as opposed to the cutaneous form for which the vaccine had been licensed in 1970). In 1995, the Army contracted with the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to develop a plan to obtain FDA approval for a license amendment for AVA in order to add inhalational anthrax exposure to the product license thus enabling the manufacturer to list on the product license that the vaccine was effective against that form of the disease. The following year, MBPI submitted an [...] "IND application" [...] to modify the product's license to add an indication for <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax,</b> thus formally establishing AVA as an [...] "experimental" [...] vaccine when used to prevent anthrax in the inhalational form.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, AVA {{was first}} {{licensed}} by the PHS for protection against cutaneous anthrax to a state-owned facility operated by the Michigan Department of Public Health.

In the mid-1980s, the FDA approved it specifically for two limited preventive indications: 1) individuals who may {{come in contact with}} animal products or high-risk persons such as veterinarians and others handling potentially infected animals; and 2) individuals engaged in diagnostic or investigational activities involving anthrax spores. In 1985, the FDA published a Proposed Rule for a specific product review of the AVA, stating that the vaccine's [...] "efficacy against <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax</b> is not well documented" [...] (a statement quoted controversially many years later). For many years, AVA was a little known product considered to be safe for pre-exposure use in the U.S. in at-risk veterinarians, laboratory workers, livestock handlers, and textile plant workers who process animal hair. In 1990, the State of Michigan changed the name of its original production plant facility to the Michigan Biologic Products Institute (MBPI) as it gave up state ownership and converted it to a private entity. The same year (as later revealed) MBPI changed both the fermenters and the filters used in manufacturing AVA without notifying the FDA, thus reportedly causing a 100 fold increase in the PA levels present in vaccine lots.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Successful {{treatment}} of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax,</b> pneumonic plague and tularemia {{can be achieved}} with fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and initiation of treatment is most effective when administered {{as soon as possible}} following exposure. Bacillus anthracis Ames, Yersinia pestis CO 92, and Francisella tularensis SCHU S 4 have equivalent susceptibility in vitro to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (minimal inhibitory concentration is 0. 03 μg/ml); however, limited information is available regarding in vivo susceptibility of these infectious agents to the fluoroquinolone antibiotics in small animal models. Mice, guinea pig, and rabbit models have been developed to evaluate the protective efficacy of antibiotic therapy against these life-threatening infections. Our results indicated that doses of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin required to protect mice against <b>inhalation</b> <b>anthrax</b> were approximately 18 -fold higher than the doses of levofloxacin required to protect against pneumonic plague and tularemia. Further, the critical period following aerosol exposure of mice to either B. anthracis spores or Y. pestis was 24 h, while mice challenged with F. tularensis could be effectively protected when treatment was delayed for as long as 72 h postchallenge.
