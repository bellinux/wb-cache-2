40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study aimed at improving the spatial representation of eco-hydrological communities on ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands. Remote sensing techniques have shown potential for peatland monitoring but most previous work has focussed on spectral approaches. Such methods often result in poor discrimination of cover types and also neglect information on the presence of peatland microtopes (e. g. hummocks and hollows), which show strong links to hydrological condition, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Spatial information on surface structure is therefore a useful proxy for peatland condition. The paper first demonstrates how airborne LiDAR data can provide such information. Secondly, we apply a combined multispectral-structural approach using IKONOS and airborne LiDAR data to the mapping of peatland condition classes (defined by the lowland raised bog inventory) at Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. LiDAR data were pre-processed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semivariogram analysis) were extracted. These were assimilated into a spectral classification procedure with an IKONOS dataset where thematic outputs from per-pixel maximum likelihood classification were compared. Field ecological survey data were used to validate the results which showed considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland eco-hydrological classes, when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semivariance at 5 m lag were included. Of key importance was the improved delineation of management classes (Eriophorum bog, active raised bog, Rhynchospora alba communities, and Calluna- and Erica-dominated <b>degraded</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bog).</b> The paper demonstrates how combined textural-optical approaches can offer improvements in land cover mapping products in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would otherwise result in considerable thematic uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing {{techniques}} have potential for peatland monitoring, but most previous work {{has focused on}} spectral approaches that often result in poor discrimination of cover types and neglect structural information. Peatlands contain structural “microtopes ” (e. g., hummocks and hollows) which are linked to hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and information on surface structure is thus a useful proxy for peatland condition. Th e objective of this work was to develop and test a new eco-hydrological mapping technique for ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using a combined spectral-structural remote sensing approach. Th e study site was Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. Airborne light dectection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used with IKONOS data in a combined multispectral-structural approach for mapping peatland condition classes. LiDAR data were preprocessed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semi-variogram analysis) were extracted. Th ese were assimilated alongside IKONOS data into a maximum likelihood classifi cation procedure, and thematic outputs were compared. Ecological survey data were used to validate the results. Considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland classes were achieved when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semi-variance were included. Specifi cally, the classifi cation accuracy improved from 71. 8 % (IKONOS data only) to 88. 0 % when a LiDAR semi-variance product was used. Of note was the improved delineation of management classes (including Eriophorum bog, active raised bog and <b>degraded</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bog).</b> Th e application of a combined textural-optical approach can improve land cover mapping in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would otherwise result in considerable thematic uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|<b>Raised</b> <b>bogs</b> {{started to}} form in Ireland at least 7000 years ago when peat started to {{accumulate}} in water-filled depressions left after the last glacial period. Due to centuries of damaging human activities, only 1 % of the living, growing active <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> habitat remains and this is rapidly being lost. <b>Raised</b> <b>bogs</b> are important reservoirs of biodiversity, hosting many uniquely adapted {{plant and animal species}} and are of high conservation concern internationally. The aims of this study were to objectively assess the potential of macro-moths as active <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> biodiversity indicators, to collate baseline information on the distribution of this fauna on threatened midland <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> habitat and to identify species with restricted distributions which may be of conservation concern. Macro-moths were sampled using light-traps on twelve midland <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> from early July to the end of October in 2011. Six high conservation value bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservations (SACs) and six undesignated and degraded bogs were surveyed. A total of 1, 816 adult individuals of 93 moth species were recorded, representing 16 % of the Irish moth fauna. Four species new to County Offaly were recorded. Only two potential indicator species of active <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> were found, with only one species (Acronicta menyanthidis (Esper, 1789)) significantly correlated with the wettest areas of active <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> (P = 0. 01). <b>Raised</b> <b>bog</b> associated nocturnal macro-moth assemblages showed a significantly nested structure (P < 0. 01), common in fragmented habitats, whereby species-poor sites form a nested subset of species-rich sites. The difference between designated and undesignated <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> associated moth assemblages was significant (A = 0. 044; P = 0. 038), but within group homogeneity was low. As designated and undesignated bogs contain assemblages which are broadly similar, {{the findings of this study}} would suggest that even <b>degraded</b> undesignated <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> remnants, may be of significant conservation value for macro-moth species...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of paper}} is to present the {{diversity}} of water level fluctuations in <b>degraded</b> Baltic <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> An {{attempt was made to}} answer the question how strong the diversity of fluctuations is both within each object and between two objects situated close to each other. Moreover, speed and value of the response of water level to atmospheric precipitation were analysed. The spatial scope of the paper covers two Baltic <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> in {{the lower part of the}} Łeba river valley: Czarne Bagno and Łebskie Bagno. The time scope covers years 2012 - 2014. The study found that both analysed bogs were a high dynamic in variation of groundwater level. Annual amplitudes of fluctuations in the water table was in the range of 28. 4 to 77. 9 cm (Łebskie Bagno) and of 45. 6 to 105. 0 cm (Czarne Bagno). It has been observed that lowering the water level on both peatlands always been recorded in the summer months, whilst the increase in the autumn, which lasted until spring. Retention and the water level on peatlands influenced primarily precipitation. Extreme meteorological conditions that make it less conspicuous is the variation resulting from factors such as location in different parts of the bog or type of degradation...|$|R

40|$|Manmade {{changes of}} landscapes {{and the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} through an on-going intensification of agricultural land use demand for the monitoring of natural habitats, vegetation types and their changes. EU Policies like the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) directive or the High Nature Value (HNV) farmland (EU rural policy framework) request the observation and conservation of natural vegetation with a reporting duty on the conservation status of these areas every six and four years. The FFH directive includes natural and semi-natural vegetation identified as Natura 2000 conservation areas and the HNV farmlands are areas in which the major land use is agriculture but also include a high species and habitat diversity or species of European conservation concern. In the context of this major demand of reporting, remote sensing has great advantages as basis for monitoring of vegetation types and habitats, as it is able to provide large-scale up-to-date geo-information for these monitoring and management activities. However, the monitoring of vegetation demands for data acquisitions at specific times during the growing season. SAR-based systems have the great advantage of acquiring data of the Earth surface within these crucial time frames weather and daytime independent. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) has the potential to acquire images with a high spatial resolution of less than 10 m {{and at the same time}} a high temporal resolution of 11 days repetition rate. In addition, textural information and the potential to analyse dielectric characteristics (e. g. moisture) enable the differentiation of various vegetation types and the deduction of biophysical characteristics. Within the project MSAVE, the applicability of temporally and geometrically high resolution data of optical, SAR and hyperspectral sensors for the monitoring of vegetation is evaluated and new methods for the analysis of multi-seasonal remote sensing data are developed, which are suited for the identification and quantification of habitats. The herein presented work as part of the project centres the evaluation of the differentiability of NATURA 2000 habitats and HNV grassland with TS-X time series data. Thereby, a TS-X time series consisting of 11 dual-pol (VV/VH) acquisitions in 2011 for the test area located in Southern Bavaria as well as reference data collected during several field surveys within the SAR data collection period are used for the classification of different grassland types, which include the FFH habitat types 6410 (Molinia meadows), 7120 (<b>Degraded</b> <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> still capable of natural regeneration), 7140 (Transition mires and quaking bogs) and 7230 (Alkaline fens), as well as HNV grassland. Up-to-now, the TS-X time series has been pre-processed including multi-temporal filtering and the Kennaugh decomposition developed by Schmitt, A. (2012) has been applied to the data. Furthermore, texture features were derived. After a separability analysis for defining the best suitable features for discriminating the different grassland types, the classification is performed with the Maximum-Entropy algorithm. First results show that the high temporal and geometric resolution time series of TS-X allows for a detailed analysis on the usability of polarimetric SAR data for the classification of different vegetation types. The distribution of FFH habitats and HNV grassland can be modelled by means of Kennaugh elements of cross-polar TS-X time series data. The discrimination of the different grassland types is further improved including texture features in the classification...|$|R

40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Community are obliged to monitor the {{development}} of conservation status of natural habitats protected by the Habitats Directive. In Denmark a comprehensive programme on nature monitoring, called NOVANA, was launched in 2004. The monitoring programme is developed by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI). <b>Raised</b> <b>bogs</b> {{are one of the}} natural habitats included in the programme. This master thesis investigates how the nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is organized in Denmark. Based on raised bogs’ unique ecology, it is assessed whether NERI’s approach to monitor <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is adequate. The thesis focuses on application of methods to monitor vegetation ecology. As a part of this research project, two <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> Skidendam and Holmegårds Mose, have been subjected to nature monitoring during autumn 2004. Similar nature monitoring was conducted in both bogs in 1987 and 1995. In order to examine the development of conservation status of the bogs over the time span, the results from the three sets of data are compared. The thesis takes in theories on ecology of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> theories on organization of nature monitoring and theories on aggregation of monitoring data. It is concluded that the conservation status of Skidendam is favourable; that the conservation status of Holmegårds Mose is unfavourable. Moreover, it is concluded that NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is inadequate. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> is based on an insufficient understanding of the special hydrological and morphological structure of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> This has resulted in the use of inappropriate criteria for favourable conservation status of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs.</b> NERI’s approach to nature monitoring is organized against these criteria.

5000|$|Europe: The largest central European <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> {{areas are}} the {{southern}} North Sea coastal {{area and the}} Alpine Foreland. As in North America there is a succession of <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> types {{along the line of}} descent towards the ocean, from northwest to southeast. As a result of peat use, <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> have been harvested for peat and cultivated, apart from a few remnants (less than 10 % of the original area). The largest contiguous <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in central Europe was the Bourtange Moor, which originally covered an area of about 2,300 km² including the Dutch portion, but only small sections remain. The largest remaining <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in northern Europe is the 76 km² Lille Vildmose. Other large <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> are the Teufelsmoor northeast of Bremen, the Vehnemoor (exhausted) and the Esterweger Dose (formerly about 80 km², exhausted) between Oldenburg and Papenburg. The <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> of the Central Uplands of the Harz, Solling, Thuringian Forest (Großer Beerberg, Schneekopf - Teufelsbad, Fichtenkopf, Saukopf), Giant Mountains, Ore Mountains, Fichtel and Rhön (Black Moor, Red Moor) are, by contract, comparatively small. In the Black Forest the Wildseemoor has been protected and, in the Vosges on le Tanet, north of the Col de la Schlucht a large area has been protected. The Alpine Foreland, which was formed by ice-age glaciation, is also rich in peatland. The Wurzacher Ried (Haidgauer Regenmoorschild) is considered the largest and best preserved <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in central Europe.

40|$|High moors, or <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> are {{a rather}} common physiographic feature of {{northern}} Europe, but in North America {{they are more}} or less limited to coasal areas. Some of these American <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> are described by Ganong (5) for New Brunswick, by Nichols (10) and Dachnowski (2) for Maine, and by Rigg (11) for southeastern Alaska. In more recent years a few <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> have also been reported for inland areas in North America. Gordon (7) described one at Urbana, Ohio, and Rigg (11, 12) one at Itaska Park, Minnesota, and another at Yellowstone Park. All authors who described <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> stressed their infrequent occurrence, especially in interior locations. It was, therefore, more than the first thrill of contact with a <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> which enthused the authors about discovery of a <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> in centrally located Indiana. Naturally, a detailed study was planned at once. We called it Cabin Creek <b>Raised</b> <b>Bog</b> because of its location in the floodplain of Cabin Creek.

50|$|Thus the <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> rises {{very slowly}} above {{the level of}} the {{groundwater}} level, hence its name. As the resulting peat slowly rises above the influence of mineral salts in the groundwater, it reaches a point where the development of the <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> begins to change in nature; that is, the bog now becomes fed solely by rainwater, which is low in salt water. By contrast, mire-formed <b>raised</b> <b>bogs,</b> are created directly on the mineral substrate of in low-salt area without having been initially formed as fens (see figure on the left in the sequence). They are formed either as a primary bog due to the erosion of previously dry mineral soils, for example due to clearing, climate change or infiltration, or as a secondary process {{as a result of the}} growth of a <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> on neighbouring mineral soil. The formation of a typical <b>raised</b> <b>bog</b> is a very slow process, which lasts from centuries to a thousand years even in favourable, undisturbed conditions.

50|$|The {{formation}} of <b>raised</b> <b>bogs</b> {{is dependent on}} the climate, that is to say the amount of precipitation and rate of evaporation, which in turn are decisively determined by the temperature.
