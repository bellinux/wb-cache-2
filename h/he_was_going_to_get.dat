5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|Although {{considered}} an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no.1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested {{transfer to the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No.9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In {{the first week of}} December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman Longhorn after standing duty all night, and his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.|$|E

25|$|On 28 February 1998, Reddy {{raped and}} murdered 37-year-old widow Jayashree Maradi Subbaiah in Peenya. The police believe that he {{repeatedly}} raped the dead body. When her 8-year-old son Suresh returned from school, he saw Reddy in his house. Reddy told the boy that an evil spirit had entered his mother's body, so he had tied her to the window grill. He then fled saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a doctor. Reddy then attempted to rape another woman in Peenya. When the woman raised the alarm, he tried to escape by jumping from {{the first floor of}} the house. He sprained his ankle, and was caught by the neighbours, who handed him over to the police.|$|E
500|$|The Roughriders offered Speedie double his Browns salary as the Canadian leagues {{tried to}} make names for {{themselves}} by signing top-level NFL players. Paul Brown refused to match the offer, and Speedie, who was making $11,000 per year with the Browns, joined the Canadian team for the 1953 season. Brown then threatened to sue Speedie for violating his existing contract with the team, saying the Browns had exercised an option to extend the deal after it expired {{in the summer of}} 1953. [...] "This was a case of jumping a contract, pure and simple, as this young man morally and ethically had a contract with us", Brown said at the time. Speedie later said that Brown [...] "told me when I jumped leagues that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> even with me".|$|E

500|$|On January 10, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{recordings}} for RCA in Nashville. Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, {{to fill out the}} sound. The session produced the moody, unusual [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's [...] "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, {{reached the top of the}} Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager. Gladys Presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to Presley and had hardly been to any of her son's performances because she was worried <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt, she remarked to him repeatedly: [...] "Elvis, the Colonel is going to work you to your death.

500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E

One Cabinet minister wrote: [...] "The London newspapers and the Tories clamor for {{an expedition to}} Khartoum, the former from ignorance, the latter {{because it is the}} best model of embarrassing us...Of course it is not an impossible undertaking, but it is melancholy to think of the waste of lives and the treasure which it must involve".
