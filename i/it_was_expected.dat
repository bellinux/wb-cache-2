5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2013, {{the state}} Duma {{approved}} a general amnesty for various prisoners; {{among those who}} qualified for amnesty were those in prison for non-violent offences and mothers of young children. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina would be among those who were released.

5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following {{problems with the}} Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS {{was not going to}} be flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E

5|$|As ununennium is {{the lightest}} undiscovered element, {{it has been}} the target of {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross-section, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was {{recovering}} from a sprained knee ligament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

5|$|At these speeds, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> {{that the}} B-70 {{would be almost}} immune to {{interceptor}} aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend {{only a few minutes}} over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the controversy, {{the first}} E85 {{flexible}} fuel vehicles {{were introduced in}} November 2008. The first two models available in the Thai market were the Volvo S80 and the C30. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By {{the time of the}} introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that 15 fueling stations in Bangkok will have E85 fuel available. In October 2009 the Mitsubishi Lancer Ex was launched becoming the first mass-production E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.|$|E

5|$|During the 1997 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl selection committee held contracts {{with both the}} Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences. In exchange for guaranteeing to pay a total of $3.2 million to the participating teams, the committee held the right to the second pick of bowl-eligible teams from each conference. Each conference's champion was awarded an automatic spot in a Bowl Alliance game, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that the Gator Bowl would select each conference's second-place team unless other circumstances arose.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} pile and some tents {{could be found}} {{at the site of the}} future bridge. Men in the region were also awaiting employment on the structure, and by the middle of the year unemployment problems were becoming a serious issue.

5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common.

Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

5|$|Following his 2009–10 OHL season, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> Hodgson {{would join}} the Manitoba Moose for a second {{consecutive}} AHL playoff season. However, after being assessed by Canucks team doctors, his broken toe was judged to {{have not yet fully}} healed and he was not cleared for AHL assignment. Hodgson additionally believed that he had re-injured his back while colliding head-first into the boards during Game 7 of the opening playoff round. He underwent an MRI in the off-season, which uncovered the misdiagnosed bulging disc to be a muscle strain instead. With the Canucks' consent, he trained in the off-season with former NHL player Gary Roberts, who had himself overcome a back injury during his career.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction of the development by Multiplex proceeded, and floor space was leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four floors of the building remained for lease and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be fully let before completion.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
