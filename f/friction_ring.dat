40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates a damping {{strategy}} for integrally bladed disks (blisks) {{based on the}} use of <b>friction</b> <b>rings.</b> The steady-state forced response of the blisk with <b>friction</b> <b>rings</b> is derived using the so-called dynamic Lagrangian frequency-time method adapted to cyclic structures with rotating excitations. In addition, an original approach for optimal determination of the number of Fourier harmonics is proposed. In numerical applications, a representative compressor blisk featuring several rings is considered. Each substructure is modeled using finite-elements and a reduced-order modeling technique is used for the blisk. The efficiency of this damping technology is investigated, and friction dissipation phenomena are interpreted with respect to frequency responses. It is shown that the friction damping effectiveness depends mainly on the level of dynamic coupling between blades and disk, and on whether the dynamics features significant alternating stick/slip phases. Through parameter studies, design guidelines are also proposed...|$|R

The 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the <b>friction</b> <b>ring</b> placed at the forward end of the barrel recoil spring. The Model 11 had a brass <b>friction</b> <b>ring</b> with one blunt end and one beveled end. The ring fit into a corresponding cut in the barrel underlug.

40|$|In an {{internal}} combustion engine piston, piston ring and cylinder {{are the most important}} assembly for transmitting the forces produced by the combustion process. The <b>friction</b> between piston <b>ring</b> pack and cylinder accounts for major portion of friction in {{an internal}} combustion engine and it also significantly affects the mechanical efficiency of the engine. In the piston <b>ring</b> pack, <b>friction</b> is mainly due to the compression ring, especially at the top dead centre and bottom dead centre where boundary lubrication exists. This paper provides a detailed study on the effect of ring profile on <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> using MATLAB code. Three different ring profiles were selected and analysed for lubricant film thickness, ring twist angle, <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> and friction coefficient. Out of these three, friction force and friction coefficient of one ring profile design was found minimum.

40|$|Piston <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> losses {{account for}} {{approximately}} 20 % {{of the total}} mechanical losses in modern internal combustion engines. A reduction in piston <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> would therefore result in higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop low-friction piston ring designs to improve engine efficiency, without adversely affecting oil consumption, blowby, wear, or cost. These are desirable objectives for today's engine manufacturers as they strive to improve engine performance while trying to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Using an existing piston <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> and lubrication model, the main contributors to friction in modern internal combustion engines were identified as the top ring around top dead center of the compression/expansion strokes and the oil control ring throughout the engine cycle. Model predictions indicated that the top <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> could be reduced by implementing a skewed barrel profile design or an upward piston groove tilt design, and oil control <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> could be reduced by decreasing ring tension. An increase in groove wear was predicted to occur with the upward piston groove tilt design, which could be eliminated by the introduction of a positive static twist on the top ring. An increase in oil consumption was predicted to occur with the low-tension oil control ring design, which could be mitigated either by the introduction of a negative static twist on the second ring, or by the implementation of the skewed barrel top ring design. Model predictions indicated that by combining the low-friction designs, a reduction in piston <b>ring</b> pack <b>friction</b> of 30 - 35 % could be achieved, without an increase in blowby, wear, or oil consumption. (cont.) Experimental results conducted on a full-scale natural gas power generation engine supported the model predictions for the low-tension oil control ring design. The predicted reduction in piston <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> would translate to a 0. 5 - 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency, which would result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and a substantial reduction in emissions over the life of the engine. by Grant Smedley.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system introduced in 1927. Back brakes, expanding shoes in enclosed drums, are applied by rods from the hand lever outside the {{body on the}} off-side (to the driver's right). Four-wheel brakes actuated by the pedal through a master-plunger operate on the front wheels and on (the back wheels through) the transmission just behind the gearbox. On the front wheels the brakes expand internally within big ribbed enclosed drums and on the transmission the brake contracts. Operation is hydraulic, the transmission brake by having smaller pistons receives {{only a third of}} the force. The system is self-adjusting and self-compensating. Equalisation is ensured by the sizes of the plungers. Automatic adjustment is made by the action of a <b>friction</b> <b>ring</b> fitted in a recess in the plunger of the operating system. The front brakes are operated by a quick-thread screw formed by steel balls in grooves. The leading shoe in each wheel is arranged to come on slightly earlier and to release a shade before the other.|$|E
50|$|Mount Pleasant Mill {{worked by}} wind until 1933 {{and by a}} diesel single {{cylinder}} Crossley engine until 1973. Fred Banks, who ran it then, also owned Alford Windmill. It is the only windmill in the area beside Heapham Mill with original and unrestored equipment and machinery of the 1920s and 1930s. The original cap with the oak cap frame is still in place. The original windshaft, wallower, upright shaft and great spur wheel are made of cast iron, as are the tooth ring of the wooden brakewheel with its timber clasp arm construction and wooden brake, all installed in the 1930s. A refinement to the mill is the elevator to replace the old sack hoist which worked off {{the underside of the}} wallower by a <b>friction</b> <b>ring,</b> and the elevator to feed the first floor bin (3rd floor) for the hurst frame. This is a massive timber frame supporting the transfer gearing and heavy mill stones casings, helping to reduce the vibration of the turning mill stones and their wheels (stone nuts). It is a separate structure inside the mill tower thus reducing the transfer of vibrations and noise into the building itself.|$|E

Effects of floating liner engine system dynamics and piston skirt friction were addressed and methods to mitigate them were discussed. A deterministic twin land oil control ring model was used for <b>ring</b> <b>friction</b> calculation.

50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil control <b>ring</b> to reduce <b>friction.</b> This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil control ring. It used low <b>friction</b> <b>rings</b> and a molybdenum disulphide coating on smaller piston skirts to reduce friction. One huge change in engine architecture was the change from centre gear drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction. This overall reduction in friction also allowed the engine to see the higher engine revolutions Honda desired without losing horsepower. The RC45 also followed the RC30 in using titanium connecting rods in a revised format, made lighter and stronger, to help cope with the extra rpm the moving parts of a race engine were expected to see.|$|R

Through the system vibra-tion is applied on the ring-traveller, which has effects on the centrifugal force of the traveller and helps the traveller to rotate around ring with intermittent contact. The effect of vibration on yarn tension as well as <b>friction</b> between the <b>ring</b> and the traveler and the corresponding raise in temperature of the ring during spinning are measured.
