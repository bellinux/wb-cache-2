25|$|Another popular {{theory is}} Loop quantum gravity (LQG), a theory first {{proposed}} by Carlo Rovelli {{that describes the}} quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time, because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity. LQG {{is an attempt to}} merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity. The main output of the theory is a physical picture of space where space is granular. The granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization. It has the same nature of the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism or the <b>discrete</b> <b>levels</b> of the energy of the atoms. But here it is space itself which is discrete.|$|E

30|$|The second peak can be {{explained}} by the presence of spatial quantization levels in the system associated with Ge quantum dots. This peak is broadened and probably corresponds not to a single discrete but to a system of closely lying levels, due to the inhomogeneity of such parameters of quantum dots as their lateral size, height, shape, and density in the array. We explain the appearance and modification of peaks by the following fact. With a change in the applied voltage, the electrochemical potential occasionally crosses the <b>discrete</b> energy <b>levels</b> and it produces oscillations in the charge density distribution. The reason for this is the thermionic emission of charge carriers from a <b>discrete</b> <b>level.</b> <b>Discrete</b> <b>level</b> gives partial charge density increment. This increment of charge leads to an increase in the external circuit current measured as a change in conductance of a sample.|$|R
