25|$|Second {{generation}} {{sales in}} Japan began October 7, 1993, and an introductory price of ¥2,753,000 for the twin turbo GT (approx USD $25,250 at 1993 yen exchange rate), with an introduction for model year 1995 in North America {{with a full}} body and chassis revision. The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis. The tail light appearance on both the sedan and wagon {{was influenced by the}} taillights on the SVX. In 1996, Subaru decided to make AWD standard equipment in all vehicles produced for the North American market, which would be the case until 2012. Subaru still offered a choice between FWD and AWD for its domestic market vehicles for this generation. The increased ground clearance Outback was introduced with this generation in 1995 with AWD only internationally, and the air suspension with <b>height</b> <b>control</b> was no longer offered.|$|E

2500|$|TGVs {{travel at}} up to [...] in {{commercial}} use. All are at least bi-current, {{which means that they}} can operate at 25kV, 50HzAC (including LGVs) and at 1.5kVDC (such as the 1.5kV lignes classiques south of Paris). Trains to Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands must accommodate other voltages, requiring tri-current and quadri-current TGVs. TGVs have two pairs of pantographs, two for AC use and two for DC. When passing between areas of different supply voltage, marker boards remind the driver to turn off power, lower the pantograph(s), adjust a switch to select the appropriate system, and raise the pantograph(s). Pantographs and pantograph <b>height</b> <b>control</b> are selected automatically based on the voltage system chosen by the driver. Once the train detects the correct supply, a dashboard indicator illuminates and the driver can switch on the traction motors. The train coasts across the boundary between sections.|$|E

50|$|Reportedly, pilots {{found that}} the main initial {{difficulty}} in flying the TMR was the regulation of the aircraft's height; this was partially due to the slow response of the engine to throttle movements being commanded by the pilot. The delay interval between the throttle and the engine response was often around the one-to-two second mark; pilots would typically adapt to this peculiarity of the aircraft and become adept at mastering <b>height</b> <b>control.</b> Two {{attempts were made to}} improve the <b>height</b> <b>control,</b> the addition of a simplistic trimmer on the throttle to restrict its possible speed of movement, and the installation of 'throttle-anticipators' that failed to operate as intended. The TMR effectively demonstrated that delay in the <b>height</b> <b>control</b> response would be a major difficulty of VTOL aircraft, and the engines of later VTOL aircraft did typically feature faster response times.|$|E
