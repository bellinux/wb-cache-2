5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by visual aids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E

The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944.

At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Una-class midget submarines three decades later.

Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine, pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine. Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed. Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days. In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died.

Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing {{in the absence of}} a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire.

By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with {{the progress of the}} 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E

The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB.
