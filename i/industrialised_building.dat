40|$|<b>Industrialised</b> <b>building</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} satisfying changes needed in the Swedish building sector. Over the last decade <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> has also developed as a niche within this sector. Given its potential, however, some stakeholders think that <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> has not yet had the impact they expected, and that the building sector is still in need of change to meet demands for cost reduction, quality improvement and longer managerial time-spans. Consequently, questions arise regarding the competitive position of <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> today, and the underlying causes for its present state. This study is based on a literature review, assessing <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> over recent decades, and on complementary interviews with researchers and practitioners. The findings are summarised in a conceptual model that outlines the sought effects of <b>industrialised</b> <b>building,</b> as well as the forces that drive and restrain change towards <b>industrialised</b> <b>building.</b> The demands on the building sector are the main drivers of change for the industry.

The huge growth of the cities, the increasing industrialization, {{and the emergence of}} various men-related noxious products, have mach "risk-environment" a common place. To prevent the harmful effects of this risk environment should be an apprehension of the goverments, environment technicians and health professionals. This prevention should act in three fields:–Outside the buildings–Inside the buildings–Inside the factories and·industrialised buildings. Outside the buildings a special attention should be drawen to car pollution and the places neighbouring the industrialised zones. The education of citizens, measuring of pollution levels and the use of clear and less pollutants technologies, is of almost importance in this situation. Inside the buildings, the prevention of "risk environment" should take into consideration the maintenance of adequate humidity and temperatures as well as effection air ventilation and renovation systems. The meeting rooms should have dimensions appropriate to the number of people, smoking habits and the existence of computers. To avert the harmful effects of "risk environment" inside the factories and <b>industrialised</b> <b>buildings,</b> the following measures should be taken:–Environmental vigilance–Medical watchfulness of the labours. The environmental vigilance corresponds fundamentally in outhing the wonn place, measuring pollutants concentration, and the existence of air ventilation and renovation means. The medical watchfulness of labours should begin in admission and periodical tests for a certain work-place.

40|$|Criticism of the {{building}} sector in Sweden, concerning for example high cost and poor quality, has lead to a growing interest in <b>industrialised</b> <b>building.</b> However, {{the effect on the}} sector and the overall building market is still quite insignificant. One business challenge for <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> companies to face in order to become more competitive is to further improve client/market interaction, improve mutual understanding and to reduce uncertainties in client relations. In this ongoing work the communication between <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> companies and building clients is examined. The aim is to identify important points of client-contractor communication that affect project outcome and present barriers to effective communication. In addition to a literature review, with the aim to define effective communication, the client-contractor communication in different building projects has been studied. Empirical data was collected through interviews and workshops, observations and project-specific documentation, addressing both clients and contractors. The results indicate that, in order to improve client-contractor communication, it seems important to assess if a barrier to effective communication is client uncertainty, and concerned with lack of information, or if it is client equivocality, which requires richer information rather than more information. The barrier must then be addressed accordingly. In the <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> context, client-contractor communication is probably distorted by lack of market/client knowledge concerning the <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> process, but also by previous experiences from traditional building.

40|$|It is {{irrefutable}} {{that the}} construction industry {{is in need of}} a highly technological construction method or system for the simple aim of giving it a push it deserves. In Malaysia this technologically enhanced method is known as the <b>industrialised</b> <b>Building</b> System (IBS). Concerted efforts have been made for the past decade by various responsible parties especially by the government. Therefore, the IBS 'Road Map' 2003 - 2010 was introduced and now continues with the IBS 'road map' 2011 - 2015. However, its performance is still at its infancy, which target is only at an initial stage This study seeks to identify and analyse the factor of the IBS' system's supply chain flexibility as a factor on the success of the system itself. It has been a suspicion that there exists a condition and situation where the supply chain is too rigid and is not flexible in fulfilling the needs and demands of the IBS development in Malaysia. This inflexible situation has brought about a broad range of problems and has stood {{in the way of the}} development of the <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> system, despite it being introduced since 1964. or 49 years ago.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the Maltese archipelago, a collection of islands with no other building material available apart from Globigerina limestone. Importing materials before the industrial revolution was an impractical endeavour which led for the inhabitants of the island to learn and master ways how stone {{can be used in a}} variety of ways. This restriction resulted in a cultural landscape made out of one material, hence the material has not only transcended from a building resource to a building system but also became a predominant factor in the cultural identity of the island. Furthermore, stone’s natural and massive qualities arises the sense of firmness and timelessness, qualities which are rarely found in contemporary architecture. Alas, this building tradition is being replaced by modern <b>industrialised</b> materials and <b>building</b> techniques which depend on standardisation and require much less craftsmanship. The knowledge of this art and technique of cutting volumetric stones and assembling it into a building (stereotomy) is becoming less and less of a viable option, hence in risk of becoming stagnant and redundant. This study explores regionalism from a technologic and material point of view. It investigates the combination of traditional building techniques with current emerging technologies in digital fabrication with the goal to understand, reinterpret and also extend the performance of stereotomy as building technique through the use of computer aided craftsmanship. For this reason the starting points of this research were the material characteristics and craftsmanship considerations; more specifically, compression-only structural system and 6 -axis industrial robotic arm with an abrasive diamond wire cutter. This ultimately strives for the preservation and contemporary reinterpretation of a cultural identity enrooted in the use of stone. The design case set prior to this research follows a similar trail of thought. The house for Maltese literature ‘s design intent is to give an architectural statement that would show an alternative to what post colonial Maltese society could identify themselves with. Both stone stereotomy and Maltese literature share the idea of transcendence from the mundane into the extraordinary; a narrative which was also the main driving force for the architectural gesture shown in the building’s morphology.

40|$|In today's house {{building}} curtain walls are almost exclusively used, with a lover level ofprefabrication in Sweden, since complete elements are {{often associated with}} high risk. High level of prefabrication has led to extensive moisture damage, in some cases. However, {{a higher level of}} prefabrication with retained moisture security could shortenthe construction process, streamline construction and help to industrialise the housebuilding. The prefabricated sandwich wall known for its excellent moisture resistancecan be one solution to the problem. An exterior wall with sandwich panels is dense at anearly stage. This means that the interior work can start earlier, which can lead to a moreefficient construction process. A large number of apartment buildings in Sweden are built up with facades made up ofcurtain walls. The construction process of the walls contains a number of activities thatare focusing on the efficient use of company resources. Flow efficiency focus on theobject that is added value, which means to reduce or remove all unnecessary activities. Acontractor would be able to streamline the construction process with a flow efficiencyperspective. This perspective combined with the industrial properties of the sandwichwall, could increase quality-safe and contribute to a better working environment. Thesandwich wall has a disadvantage: high relative purchase price. A case study wasconducted in order to compare the purchase price of the sandwich wall with theadditional activities that the curtain wall requires. The case study was done at Peab Bostad AB at one, for the author, known project in order to compare the lead times of the walls. Other properties of the elements such as moisture, acoustics and environment were observed. Data was collected through several interviews of employees. The model of analysis is based on a literature review of the body of knowledge regarding resource- and flow efficiency and <b>industrialised</b> house <b>building.</b> The results indicate that the sandwich element has a two months shorter lead timecompared to the curtain wall. This compared to the sandwich walls´ properties such as less variation, reduced risk of emerging of bottlenecks and led work in progress, argues for the contractor to focus on flow efficiency. The lead time is reduced, partly due to the reduced dehydration time and partly due to the reduced amount of activities. Sandwich walls supports the industrial {{house building}} process since it can be prefabricated with higher level because of its moisture resistance. The results indicates also that the purchase cost of the sandwich wall is more than twiceof the purchase cost of the curtain wall. However, the sandwich wall has a lower overallcost since of its other costs, which are dependent on the lead time. Before the study began, there were some expectations both from author and respondents on a positive outcome to the sandwich advantage, which may have caused V bias. The bias is that work environment is better and the lead time of the sandwich wall is expected to be shorter since it requires fewer completions. It is also arguable that a more frequent use of the sandwich wall could shorten down the lead time further. By creating procedures and standards that can be repeated in processes and where the lead times of the wall has little variation are known we can increase the industrialisation, meaning, taking control of processes to ensure quality and keep costs down.

40|$|An unfired clay masonry system {{complete}} with renders and fixings {{was required for}} the mainstream construction of thin non-load bearing inner leaf or interior walls in domestic dwellings. A determined movement to reduce the impact the building sector has on the environment aims to incorporate natural materials such as earth, animal products and vegetable matter into the development of building products {{for the construction of}} domestic dwellings to produce sustainable modern buildings with minimal impact on the environment. An unfired clay masonry system is the most desirable system for the construction of earth walls in modern buildings. Masonry units are extruded quickly and consistently to satisfy the demands of mainstream construction. Walls are built {{in a manner similar to}} that of concrete block-work and fired-clay brickwork used in modern construction. Specifications and standards to satisfy modern building procedures and regulations can be more readily developed for the unfired clay masonry. An investigation into the industrial extrusion of clay brick units showed that the unfired clay or green brick units were of strengths comparable to low strength materials used in the construction of thin non-load bearing walls. Suitable mortars for the unfired clay brick units were developed directly from the respective brick clays. The unfired clay mortars gave strengths and bond strengths required for the construction of thin walls with the addition of sodium silicate and the use of thin mortar joints. Unfired clay blocks extruded using brick clay representative of that most commonly used for the manufacture of fired-clay brick units gave good strengths. Masonry constructed using the unfired clay blocks and the respective sodium silicate unfired clay mortar gave good mortar strengths, mortar bond strengths, compressive strengths and flexural strengths. Compressive strengths and flexural strengths of the masonry were comparable to that of <b>industrialised</b> low strength <b>buildings</b> materials such as aerated concrete block masonry suitable for the construction of thin non-load bearing walls. The unfired clay masonry with un-mortared perpendiculars were however not suitable for the construction of thin non-load bearing walls. Compressive strengths and flexural strengths of masonry constructed with a perforated unfired clay block format were substantially lower than those of masonry constructed with a solid unfired clay block format. Compressive strengths were suitable for the construction of thin non-load bearing walls but flexural strengths were not in particular the flexural strengths measured when loading perpendicular to the bed joints. Wood-fibre significantly improved the strength and toughness of the unfired clay masonry and a similar perforated wood-fibre block significantly improved the flexural strength perpendicular to the bed joints giving masonry of the desired flexural strengths. Adding wood-fibre into the extrusion process was problematic but a successful procedure was developed to incorporate the wood-fibre into the brick clay mixture prior to extrusion. Moisture significantly influenced the strength of the unfired clay masonry. At ambient conditions the strength of the unfired clay masonry is adequate but at higher moisture contents the strength decreases and exposure to water or constant exposure to very high levels of relative humidity could significantly lower the strengths of the unfired clay masonry...|$|R

This paper describes the experiences of Malaysia in the adoption of <b>industrialised</b> <b>building</b> system (IBS) from the first level of establishment until its development along with various IBS definitions and categories. A comprehensive literature review from various sources was made to carry out the study. The idea of using IBS in Malaysia was first developed during the early sixties when the Minister of Housing and Local Government visited several European countries and evaluated their building systems performance. Then, in 1964, the government took a significant decision to implement one pilot projects using IBS concept which was launched on 1966. The findings of this research illustrated the timeline of IBS establishment and development in Malaysia along with the significant consequences of IBS implementation in construction industry. Therefore, it is hoped that the finding of this research could assist professional parties in construction industry in providing a better knowledge ground for improving decisions making to achieve the success of IBS construction projects implementation that could be along with attaining the project objectives in terms of predetermined objectives that are mostly within the time, specified budget and standard quality...|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{the used}} of <b>Industrialised</b> <b>Building</b> System (IBS) in {{construction}} industry {{throughout the world}} has positive perceptions on improving the overall construction industry performance. Therefore, Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) has been actively promoting the use of <b>Industrialised</b> <b>Building</b> System (IBS) in Malaysian Construction Industry since 1998. Unfortunately, the used of IBS for building project in Malaysia is still limited if compared to CIDB's target. In view to this limitation, this study {{has been carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} current IBS implementation for Malaysian construction industry through the measurement of acceptance level on the current IBS implementation and also determination of the existing problems faced by construction industry related to the IBS implementation. The methodologies adopted for this study are interview with expert panels and questionnaire survey. The result of this study revealed that current promotion on IBS for awareness purposes is effective but unfortunately the application is still very limited since it only covers certain elements. Not all practitioners can accept it implementation especially company and personnel with less experiences in handling IBS project. It is recommended that the relevant institution which produce young engineer for construction sector must provide a syllabus on IBS which cover technical, business process, and all aspect which needed for effective IBS implementation. This can generates wider range of application of IBS product within the industry...|$|E
