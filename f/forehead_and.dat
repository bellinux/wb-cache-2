5|$|In {{the cold}} open, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{shows up at}} work imitating Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) by wearing large glasses, a short sleeved shirt and hair split on his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> pokes fun at Dwight.|$|E
5|$|Tenerife {{goldcrest}} R. r. teneriffae (Seebohm, 1883). Found only on Tenerife, Canary Islands; it is a distinctive, small subspecies {{with a black}} <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> pink-buff underparts.|$|E
5|$|The other subspecies, sclateri, has {{slightly}} longer wings {{and a smaller}} bill. The plumage is less golden, with the <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and with both the wings and tail being blue-black. The underparts of T. e. sclateri also vary in being pure white without streaks.|$|E
5000|$|... (5) The {{youth and}} the maiden with stars on their <b>foreheads</b> <b>and</b> crescents on their breasts ...|$|R
60|$|The veins rose swollen {{on their}} <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> they gasped as they obeyed him, {{but as the}} stone rose {{dripping}} there was an ominous creaking overhead.|$|R
6000|$|They came up ceremoniously {{to their}} father and kissed his hand, while he kissed their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> then said to them, [...] "There is a new play-fellow for you." ...|$|R
5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|Alexios and his guards {{resisted}} {{as long as}} {{they could}} before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to Ohrid, where he regrouped his army.|$|E
5|$|File:Paolo Ucello 001.jpg|A Young Lady of Fashion is {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mathematician Paolo Uccello and dates early 1460s. The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is made by}} x-ray/MRI appearance and has five juxta-articular classifications <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> neck, <b>and</b> shaft classifications indicating early radiological signs.|$|R
50|$|Aloha, the {{traditional}} greeting, was originally spoken while touching <b>foreheads</b> <b>and</b> exchanging {{a breath of}} air. This is possibly {{a reflection of the}} legend, exchanging the breath of life, originally given by the Gods.|$|R
50|$|The superb parrot {{is mostly}} bright green with darker flight {{feathers}} {{and is about}} 40 cm long with a long pointed tail. Adult males have continuous yellow <b>foreheads</b> <b>and</b> throats, with a red horizontal band across {{the border of the}} throat.|$|R
5|$|Portraits of Mary {{show that}} she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> regular, firm features. She was {{considered}} a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive. At some point in her infancy or childhood, she caught smallpox, but it did not mark her features.|$|E
5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|T. m. achrusterus breeds from {{southern}} Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states. It winters {{through much of}} {{the southern part of the}} breeding range. It is smaller than the nominate subspecies. The black feathers of the <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> crown have pale gray tips. The underparts are paler than those of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{take us to}} our father,' said they. So the {{fisherman}} gave them each a lambskin cap which half covered their faces, and completely hid their golden hair and the stars on their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> {{led them to the}} court.|$|R
60|$|And at {{that last}} wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the tips touched their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> broke {{out into the}} full salute--the {{crashing}} trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut of the Keddah.|$|R
50|$|Gerini {{represents}} {{the school of}} Giotto di Bondone, {{in the tradition of}} Andrea di Orcagna and of Taddeo Gaddi. As is typical for Gothic depictions, Gerini's figures have large chins, sloping <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> sharp noses whilst their bodies are squat and frontally displaced.|$|R
5|$|Aravan {{is always}} worshipped in temples {{in the form}} of his severed head. He is usually {{depicted}} with a moustache, pronounced eyes and large ears. Typically, he also wears a conical crown, a Vaishnava tilak mark on his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> earrings. Aravan is often depicted with a cobra hood over his crown, cobra heads sprouting through the crown, or a snake emerging from behind the crown. Even the chief Koovagam icon features a serpent on Aravan's crown.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> moved his leg after the {{cameraman}} had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
50|$|Kru {{people were}} more {{valuable}} as traders and sailors on slave ships than as slave labor. To ensure {{their status as}} “freemen,” they initiated the practice of tattooing their <b>foreheads</b> <b>and</b> the bridge of their nose with indigo dye to distinguish them from slave labor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{is inside}} that cage?' asked he {{of the old}} priest, as the negroes stood wiping the {{perspiration}} from their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> a smart slave-girl stepped forward, with a parasol and slippers in her hand, and reverently lifted the lower edge of the curtain.|$|R
50|$|In Pirates in Oz, {{the dumb}} Ruggedo finds {{a town in}} the Land of Ev called Menankypoo, whose people speak with words across their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> seek a dumb king. Peter, Pigasus and Captain Samuel Salt aid in his defeat and he is {{transformed}} into a jug.|$|R
5|$|In the present, Ginko, {{to escape}} a blizzard, finds a village inn. After {{revealing}} himself as a Mushishi, he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss. After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper {{to look at her}} granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on her <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> hears strange noises. Maho's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death. Maho, however, kept her mother's horns, {{which turned out to be}} a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness. Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{made his}} {{professional}} debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in Miami, Florida and defeated Michael Johnson by technical knockout {{in the second}} round. On April 14, 1998, Judah defeated Angel Beltre in the second round. Judah accidentally butted heads with Esteban Flores in a fight in March 1999. Flores was cut on his <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> the match was halted in the third round. The bout was originally recorded as a technical draw, but the result was changed to a no contest in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E
60|$|And {{when he came}} back, what do {{you think}} he saw? Why, two boys, two {{beautiful}} young princes, with hair as golden as the stars on their <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> each so like the other, that at the first glance every one would have known them for twins.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the {{introduction}} of non-invasive temperature taking methods including tympanic (ear) <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> thermometers, <b>and</b> changing attitudes on privacy and modesty have led some parents and doctors to discontinue taking rectal temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Two [...] "augment" [...] Klingon {{males and}} a female as they appear in the ST:TOS episode [...] "Day of the Dove". The bronzed skin, facial hair, lack of ridged <b>foreheads,</b> <b>and</b> simple costumes are typical of The Original Series Klingons, {{explained}} {{in a pair of}} Enterprise episodes.|$|R
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1620 (1564 CE) as per some sources, Rama again {{appeared}} to Tulsidas, {{this time as}} a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came {{and asked for a}} sandalwood Tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E
5000|$|The drake smew, {{with its}} 'cracked ice' and 'panda' appearance, is unmistakable, and looks very {{black-and-white}} in flight. The females and immature males are grey birds with chestnut <b>foreheads</b> <b>and</b> crowns, {{and can be}} confused at a distance with the ruddy duck; they are often known as [...] "redhead" [...] smew. It has oval white wing-patches in flight. The smew's bill has a hooked tip and serrated edges, which help it catch fish when it dives for them.|$|R
5000|$|Pseudo-Aristotle, in Physiognomica, {{stated that}} the {{forehead}} is governed by Mars. [...] A low <b>and</b> little <b>forehead</b> denoted magnanimity, boldness, and confidence; a fleshy <b>and</b> wrinkle-free <b>forehead,</b> litigiousness, vanity, deceit, and contentiousness; a sharp <b>forehead,</b> weakness <b>and</b> fickleness; a wrinkled <b>forehead,</b> great spirit <b>and</b> wit yet poor fortune; a round <b>forehead,</b> virtue <b>and</b> good understanding; a full large forehead, boldness, malice, boundary issues, and high spirit; and a long high forehead, honesty, weakness, simplicity, and poor fortune.|$|R
50|$|It is 17-23 cm long, with females usually smaller, and has {{a bright}} yellow <b>forehead,</b> crown <b>and</b> throat, a black mask and a yellow ear <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> tuft. The back is olive-green and underparts more olive-yellow.|$|R
