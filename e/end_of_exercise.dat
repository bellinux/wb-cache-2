50|$|Cardiac {{stress testing}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} to assess cardiac function and to disclose evidence of exertion-related cardiac hypoxia. Radionuclide testing using thallium or technetium {{can be used to}} demonstrate areas of perfusion abnormalities. With a maximal stress test the level of exercise is increased until the patient heart rate will not increase any higher, despite increased exercise. A fairly accurate estimate of the target heart rate, based on extensive clinical research, can be estimated by the formula 220 beats per minute minus patient's age. This linear relation is accurate up to about age 30, after which it mildly underestimates typical maximum attainable heart rates achievable by healthy individuals. Other formulas exist, such as that by Miller (217 - (0.85 × Age)) and others http://www.brianmac.co.uk/maxhr.htm. Achieving a high enough heart rate at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> is critical to improving the sensitivity of the test to detect high grade heart artery stenosis.|$|E

Ten male cyclists with the mean (±SE) age of 23. 8 ± 3. 7 years participated. The sEMG power spectrum median frequency (MF) of rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and erector spinae muscles, heart rate and the subjective rate of fatigue by Borg scale were measured in the beginning, during and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the knee extensor muscles was assessed before and after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> A significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in sEMG power spectrum MF for erector spinae muscle at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> compared to the initial level was found, whereas the knee extensor and flexor muscles revealed no significant changes in this parameter.

After the exercise, MVC force was significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased compared to the pre-exercise level. We concluded that based on sEMG power spectrum MF, 30 -minute cycling exercise at constant intensity caused a marked fatigue of erector spinae muscle with no significant fatigue-induced changes in knee extensor and flexor muscles.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if rating of perceived exertion (RPE) could be used to monitor the internal load during compounded circuit training (CCT) sessions in women. Thirteen young adults women performed three sessions of CCT varying the intensity according to participants' maximum heart rate (50, 70 and 90 %HRmax). Throughout the main part of CCT (35 min), HR and RPE were measured. Both variables were significantly different among the exercise intensities. However, HR and RPE were not correlated. Probably because HR at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> was similar to the beginning at 90 % and 70 % of HRmax intensities, and lower than the beginning instant at 50 % of HRmax intensity, whereas RPE increased from the beginning instant to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> for all intensities. Therefore, RPE is suitable to monitor the internal load during CCT sessions in women due to its possibility to detect the (in) tolerance to exercise, despite of the lack of correlation with HR...|$|E

We investigated the relationships between dyspnoea at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and during daily activities with clinical measurements and mortality in COPD patients. We examined 143 male outpatients with moderate to very severe COPD. The peak Borg score at the end of progressive cycle ergometry was used for the assessment of peak dyspnoea rating during exercise, and the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) score was used for dyspnoea with activities of daily living. Relationships between these dyspnoea ratings with other clinical measurements of pulmonary function, exercise indices, health status and psychological status were then investigated. In addition, their relationship with the 5 -year mortality of COPD patients was also analyzed to examine their predictive ability. Although the BDI score was significantly correlated with airflow limitation, diffusing capacity, exercise indices, health status and psychological status, the Borg score at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> had non-existent or only weak correlations with them. The BDI score was strongly significantly correlated with mortality, whereas the Borg score was not.

Changes in airway resistance were assessed by measuring peak expiratory flow rate. Significant differences in catecholamine levels between reacting and non-reacting patients were found. In 10 patients developing EIB adrenaline and noradrenaline levels had risen significantly by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and remained elevated up to the fifth minute of recovery. The rise in catechola-mine levels in non-reacting asthmatics was insignificant. In control subjects noradrenaline had increased significantly by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> Despite many years of investigation some aspects of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) remain unclear.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] VO 2 is {{expressed}} {{as the product}} of cardiac output and O 2 extraction by the Fick equation. During the incremental exercise test and constant high-intensity exercise test, VO 2 results in the attainment of maximal O 2 uptake at exhaustion. However, the differences in the physiological components, cardiac output and muscle O 2 extraction, have not been fully elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that constant exercise would result in higher O 2 extraction than incremental exercise at exhaustion. [Subjects] Twenty-five subjects performed incremen-tal exercise and constant exercise at 80 % of their peak work rate. [Methods] Ventilatory, cardiovascular, and muscle oxygenation responses were measured using a gas analyzer, Finapres, and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. [Results] VO 2 was not significantly different between the incremental exercise and constant exercise. However, cardiac output and muscle O 2 saturation were significantly lower for the constant exercise than the incremental ex-ercise at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> [Conclusion] These findings indicate that if both tests produce a similar VO 2 value, the VO 2 in incremental exercise would have a higher ratio of cardiac output than constant exercise, and VO 2 in constant exercise would have a higher ratio of O 2 extraction than incremental exercise at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise...</b>|$|E

This study examined the functional capacity of the prefrontal cortex (reflected by haemodynamics using near infrared spectroscopy) and affective responses during exercise at different intensities. Participants completed an incremental cycling exercise test to exhaustion. Changes (D) in oxygenation (O 2 Hb), deoxygenation (HHb), blood volume (tHb) and haemoglobin difference (HbDiff) were measured from bilateral dorsal and ventral prefrontal areas.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Exercise {{testing has}} become an {{important}} tool in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} restrictive lung disease. The reproducibility of variables measured during exercise testing was examined in subjects with stable restrictive lung disease. METHODS [...] Six subjects, who had never previously undergone exercise testing, each underwent three maximal incremental exercise studies on a bicycle ergometer conducted during a 28 day period. RESULTS [...] Data collected at rest, before exercise, were not significantly different during the three study days. Comparison of results at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exercise</b> tests from the three studies also revealed no evidence of a significant learning effect. Reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> performance by subjects was assessed by the coefficient of variation. The mean within subject coefficient of variation at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exercise</b> tests was 5. 6 % for work rate, 7. 9 % for exercise duration, and 9. 5 % for dyspnoea. The mean within subject coefficient of variation obtained at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exercise</b> tests was 5. 3 % for oxygen uptake (VO 2), 2. 5 % for oxygen saturation (SaO 2), 4. 0 % for heart rate (HR), 5. 5 % for minute ventilation (VE), 5. 8 % for respiratory frequency (f), and 4. 6 % for tidal volume (VT).
