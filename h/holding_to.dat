5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E

5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came {{under pressure to}} press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat {{to change his mind}} for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E

5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight.

She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E

Kroenke first launched {{a bid for}} the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Iranian London-based financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> 18,594 shares (29.9%).

5|$|On 7 January 2011, {{the parts}} {{announced}} that they had reached a compromise. Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena {{for at least the}} 2011 season. In addition, the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, {{but at the same time}} move the risk from Stabæk <b>Holding</b> <b>to</b> Stabæk Fotball. If the club declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season. On 30 June, Stabæk {{announced that they}} would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium. The necessary NOK35 million would entail a risk the club was not willing to take. The club stated that they hoped they could remain at the stadium by establishing a foundation which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen. If this does not work out, the club will have to relocate from the 2012 season. The club is then considering relocating back to Nadderud, to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst. The club estimates that any relocation would result in the club losing half their revenue. Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011, losing 1–2 against Haugesund. Subsequently, the pitch was removed, and Stabæk returned to Nadderud from the 2012 season.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna <b>holding</b> <b>to</b> {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without legal standing in US affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. <b>Holding</b> <b>to</b> the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 miles at sea.|$|E
