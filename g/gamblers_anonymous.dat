40|$|Several {{types of}} {{psychotherapy}} are currently {{used to treat}} pathological gamblers. These include <b>Gambler's</b> <b>Anonymous,</b> cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and family therapy. Research into which types of psychotherapy are the most effective for pathological gambling is limited but is a growing area of study. Group therapy, namely <b>Gambler's</b> <b>Anonymous,</b> provides peer support and structure. Cognitive behavior therapy aims to identify and correct cognitive distortions about gambling.

[...] In 1977, the Ngoys took a trip to Las Vegas where Ted saw Elvis Presley at his last performance before his death. It was here that Ngoy had his first taste of gambling while placing bets at the Blackjack tables. Ngoy would make a habit of returning monthly to watch performers such as Tom Jones, Diana Ross and Wayne Newton and indulging in the incentives pit bosses of major casinos offered all the while spending even larger sums at the card tables. This caused tension in the Ngoy household, being the center of many arguments between Ngoy and his wife. Ngoy would often visit Las Vegas {{for a period of}} a week, unbeknownst to his wife. He would forge her signature on checks and even borrow money from relatives who leased stores from him. When he was unable to pay back his debt, he would sign over his store to them.

In general, probability scoring rules, specifically the log score and better known â€œBrierâ€ 9 D (quadratic) score, are found to have higher probability of ranking rival analysts in predetermined â€œcorrectâ€ 9 D order than either (i) the more usual method of counting categorical forecast errors (misclassifications), or (ii) an economic measure of forecasting success, described here as the â€œKelly scoreâ€ 9 D and defined as the trading profits accumulated by making log optimal bets (i. e. Kelly betting) against the market maker based on the probability forecasts of the analyst being assessed. This runs counter to the conventional wisdom that financial forecasts are more aptly evaluated in terms of their financial consequences than by an abstract non-monetary measure of statistical accuracy such as the number of misclassifications or a probability score.
