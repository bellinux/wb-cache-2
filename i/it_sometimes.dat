5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. <b>It</b> <b>sometimes</b> clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> represented love and the base, natural desires of man.

However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E

5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E

5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> has an astrological or symbolic meaning.

A weir in the dike {{at the southern end of}} the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E

5|$|Like most owls, {{the barn}} owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in {{complete}} darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and {{can sometimes be}} seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, on various Pacific Islands and perhaps elsewhere, <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> hunts by day. This practice may depend on whether the owl is mobbed by other birds if it emerges in daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as magpies, rooks and black-headed gulls, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces <b>it.</b> <b>Sometimes,</b> however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E

However, he also strikes out a lot of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all {{qualifying}} MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E

5|$|The area of Omiš principality {{seems to}} have {{included}} the islands of Brač, Hvar and Vis, and probably at some point Korčula, but it is uncertain whether the land included coastal Poljica and Žrnovnica to the North and Makarska coast to the South. In the 13th century {{the center of the}} principality was Omiš, and with the title of Omiš knez (comes) the sources also mentioned the title of knez for the islands. In the 13th century the terms Kačićs (Kačići) and residents of Omiš (Omišani) are both mentioned, making <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> more difficult to reliably identify members of the genus. However, it seems that the princely titles were held only by the Kačićs. They achieved a large degree of independence from the central government and imposed the name of Omiš and Kačić family over the entire region.|$|E
5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; <b>it</b> <b>sometimes</b> impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} {{goldcrest}} is a thin, high-pitched zee {{given at}} intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. <b>It</b> <b>sometimes</b> has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
