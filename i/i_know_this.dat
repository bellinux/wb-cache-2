[...] The Atman, states Yajnavalkya, {{can be found}} in Avimuktam. Atri then asks how to find Avimuktam. The Jabala Upanishad uses wordplay to express a literal and hidden allegorical meaning. Yajnavalkya answers that Avimuktam is to be found between Varana and Nasi, or Varayati and Nasayati.|$|E
500|$|Keith Fay of {{the folk}} metal band Cruachan has also noted the {{influence}} of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine Terrorizer, {{he said that there}} is [...] "no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand what real folk music is; though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is not true for all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E

Usually we only hear of stories of success from the Gulf. But I wanted to talk about the many who lead lives of {{suffering}} and pain." [...] The reluctant Najeeb who wanted to forget his past had to be coaxed to recount his story.|$|R
500|$|Tintinologist Phillipe Goddin {{considered}} the series to be [...] "a milestone", describing it as [...] "full of promise" [...] and containing [...] "plety [...] of humour, rich in developments". The Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that [...] "Everything that made Tintin what it later became was seminally present in Totor", including the artistic style, {{the pace of}} the story, the use of humour, {{and the manner in which}} it imitated motion pictures. They also commented that Totor read like [...] "an adult was retelling one of those early American western serials... to a group of children. On the one hand he is exciting the children, but on the other he is winking at the adults as if to say, [...] "you and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is not serious."" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{daughter}} of billionaire Nikolas Natchios {{and the love}} interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

500|$|On June 22, 2017, Swanigan {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} (26th overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 3, 2017, Swanigan signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one deserves it more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E
500|$|In the verses, Spears sings {{about being}} {{in love with a}} bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> ain't smart". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994). The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as [...] "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's [...] "The Logical Song" [...] (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than {{on the rest of the}} album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are [...] "heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E
