40|$|A {{brief history}} of studies of {{standard}} setting and constituency lobbying is summarised, and a description of standard setting in New Zealand is provided. Historically, levels of responses to <b>exposure</b> <b>drafts</b> in New Zealand indicate {{there is no clear}} existing body of theory to clarify the factors contributing to the pattern in responses to <b>exposure</b> <b>drafts</b> in the last twenty years. The historic longitudinal data from New Zealand <b>exposure</b> <b>drafts</b> exhibited a pattern which could be described as consistently low with two major fluctuations. An alternative approach (expectancy theory) is explored. It is proposed that the response level in New Zealand was generally low over time because there is not a sufficient belief by stakeholders that the Board will change the resulting standard sufficiently to ensure making a submission is cost-benefit efficient. It is suggested that the fluctuations represent periods when there were changes in expectancy by participants of their potential influence on due process...|$|R

5000|$|The Preliminary Views {{and first}} <b>Exposure</b> <b>Draft</b> called for {{eliminating}} the FAS 13 test which classifies leases as operating leases or capital leases, and treating all leases similarly to current capital leases. All leases would {{be accounted for}} as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet - on the asset side as [...] "right-of-use assets" [...] and on the liability side as lease liabilities; on the income statement, depreciation and interest expense would be recognized instead of rent expense. One implication {{of this is that}} expenses are [...] "front loaded," [...] because interest expense is higher {{in the early part of}} the lease term while the liability is higher. Following substantial protests from both financial statements preparers and users, the second <b>Exposure</b> <b>Draft</b> reinstated two types of lease accounting, with [...] "Type A" [...] leases treated essentially the same as FAS 13 capital leases and [...] "Type B" [...] leases maintaining the single lease expense, straight line over the life of the lease, that characterizes FAS 13 operating leases, but with an asset and liability on the balance sheet. The liability would be the present value of the remaining rents; the asset would be the same as the liability for simple leases, but then adjusted for scheduled changes in rents (which under FAS 13 result in a deferred rent liability or asset) and amortization of initial direct costs and lease incentives. Effective with the second <b>Exposure</b> <b>Draft,</b> the new standard has been given the new Accounting Standards Codification topic number 842 (the topic number for leases was previously 840).|$|E

We analyze International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and <b>Exposure</b> <b>Drafts</b> (ED) issued by the IASB since its inception in 2002 to determine if those documents are consistent with objectives-oriented accounting standards. Our analysis is useful for gaining insights into how the IASB integrates the CF with the SEC’s recommended objectives-oriented accounting approach to promote judgement in the interest of IASB/FASB convergence of accounting standards...|$|R
