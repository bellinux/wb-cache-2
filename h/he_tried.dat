5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> his hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci).

Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E

He also supports the local disabled group and arranges gatherings for the local youth like his ping pong tournament. Back in the days he used to be friends with Montague Sr. until the accident.

In the summer of 2005, the cross country coach sent him a letter of encouragement.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E

Regarding this goal, one may organize his endeavour in three steps; first <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> to reevaluate modern subjectivism and ventures to amend it by interpreting the legionnaires of modernity; second, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> to construe the classic Persian conception of man as an ontetic absolute subject who can be reformulated in modern terms; third, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> to show a rhezomatic turn in the depth of modern subjectivism toward a neutral spirituality and divinity.|$|R
