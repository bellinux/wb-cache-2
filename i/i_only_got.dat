6000|$|... "I say, I'm awfully glad you're back. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>got</b> {{your letter}} this morning. Found {{it at the}} boarding-house. I {{happened}} to look in there and..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> had <b>only</b> <b>got</b> {{her with}} me--if <b>I</b> <b>only</b> had!" [...] he said. [...] "Hard {{work would be}} nothing to me then! But that was not to be.

6000|$|... "Horribly awkward. Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>only</b> <b>got</b> fifteen {{thousand}} left, and unless things go right at Goodwood I shall be cleaned right out. I calculated {{that everything would}} be set right if I married this girl. Things have gone badly of late." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'There, {{what have}} I done?' exclaimed Miss Vincent in dismay. 'But <b>I</b> had <b>only</b> just <b>got</b> the letter, and had barely glanced through it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not many," [...] he commented, {{glancing at}} the trout Lisle laid down. [...] "They'll hardly carry us over to-morrow, and <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>got</b> a couple from the canoe with the troll. We've gained nothing by {{stopping}} here, and time's precious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How was I to know?--Boo--hoo," [...] Loretta was crying. [...] "He didn't tell me. Nobody else ever kissed me. I {{never dreamed}} a kiss {{could be so}} terrible... until, boo-hoo... until he wrote to me. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>got</b> the letter this morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Much good may it do them," [...] growled Gershom--"they've lost me that whiskey, and {{let them}} long for it without gettin' any, as a {{punishment}} for the same.

6000|$|... "That was {{certainly}} easy enough," [...] remarked Dave, while Barringford was busy lighting the tinder in his box. [...] "I declare <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>got</b> {{the water on}} my head and shoulders. With a good big hood a fellow could keep as dry as a bone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} could see this place and the view from this room. <b>I</b> have <b>only</b> <b>got</b> into it within this hour. The {{carpenters}} are just out of it. You know that I left Palmer here about eleven months ago, on the return from that island voyage. He had sixteen lads with him, of whom eleven were good stout fellows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye--es," [...] {{she said}} doubtfully, [...] "yes, I think that I {{remember}} you.
