5000|$|A {{letter card}} almost has the {{advantages}} of a postal card as far as weight and size, but also the advantage of privacy of contents is concerned. [...] It is a double card, folded over, with gum or adhesive applied to the three open edges. It is then opened by the recipient by tearing perforations on the three sides {{that are on the}} message side of the gum. [...] The <b>gummed</b> <b>strip</b> around the card is then discarded, giving rise to the problems collectors have in finding intact used cards. The US has never issued any letter cards.|$|E
50|$|Backroll is {{a widely}} used method for hand-rolling a cigarette. The method {{involves}} inversion of the rolling paper, so that the <b>gum</b> <b>strip</b> faces the inside. Once rolled, the gum can then be licked through the paper and torn off, thus removing any excess paper. This technique was developed due to the alleged increased heat (possibly caused by additives) generated by smoking tobacco wrapped in multiple layers of paper.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} independently {{investigated the}} basis of the chewing gum induced context-dependent memory effect. At learning and/or recall, participants either chewed flavourless gum (Experiment 1) or received mint-flavoured strips (Experiment 2). No context-dependent memory effect was found with either flavourless <b>gum</b> or mint-flavoured <b>strips,</b> indicating that independently the contexts were insufficiently salient to induce the effect. This is found despite participants' subjective ratings indicating a perceived change in state following administration of flavourless <b>gum</b> or mint-flavoured <b>strips.</b> Additionally, some preliminary evidence for a non-additive facilitative effect of receiving gum or flavour at either learning and/or recall is reported. The findings raise further concerns regarding the robustness of the previously reported context-dependent memory effect with chewing gum...|$|R
5000|$|The Pope Sixtus V had {{appointed}} the 3rd committee of scholars {{to continue the}} work. The committee was under the presidency of Cardinal Carafa. The work was prepared {{on the basis of}} the edition of Robertus Stephanus from Louvain (1583) and good manuscripts were used as authorities, including notably Codex Amiatinus. Carafa presented the result of their work, in the beginning of 1589, but Sixtus rejected their work and in 18 months prepared another text he corrected to agree with the Greek and Hebrew, He used Codex Carafianus, but it was hurried into print and suffered from many printing errors, as well as serious problems reflecting the inability of the headstrong Sixtus as a Bible scholar. Three whole verses were dropped from the Book of Numbers; Numbers 30:11-13, though it is unclear whether this was an error in printing, or a 'wild' editorial choice by Sixtus himself. In May 1590 the completed work was issued from the press in three volumes;, but even after printing, Sixtus continued to tinker with the text, sending out revised readings on <b>gummed</b> <b>strips</b> to be pasted over the printed pages. After his death Robert Bellarmine warned that this work was an embarrassment, and a great danger to the church.|$|R
60|$|That Australia, however, will {{some day}} make amends by {{producing}} a poet {{of her own}} we cannot doubt, and for him there will be new notes to sound and new wonders to tell of. The description, given by Mr. Marcus Clarke {{in the preface to}} this volume, of the aspect and spirit of Nature in Australia is most curious and suggestive. The Australian forests, he tells us, are funereal and stern, and 'seem to stifle, in their black gorges, a story of sullen despair.' No leaves fall from the trees, but 'from the melancholy <b>gum</b> <b>strips</b> of white bark hang and rustle. Great grey kangaroos hop noiselessly over the coarse grass. Flights of cockatoos stream out, shrieking like evil souls. The sun suddenly sinks and the mopokes burst out into horrible peals of semi-human laughter.' The aborigines aver that, when night comes, from the bottomless depth of some lagoon a misshapen monster rises, dragging his loathsome length along the ooze. From a corner of the silent forest rises a dismal chant, and around a fire dance natives painted like skeletons. All is fear-inspiring and gloomy. No bright fancies are linked with the memories of the mountains. Hopeless explorers have named them out of their sufferings--Mount Misery, Mount Dreadful, Mount Despair.|$|R
