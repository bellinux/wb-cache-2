40|$|Suppose we are {{prepared}} to conceive the meaning of a sentence as a classification criterion which enables us to establish whether something is or is not a justification to believe that sentence. Which properties of the intuitive notion of justification to believe a sentence are essential from this point of view? And how might a theoretical notion of <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a sentence be defined? In Sections 2 - 5 some properties are suggested as essential, in particular Intentionality (a justification is always a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a sentence), Defeasibility (a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a sentence A can cease to be a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A as new information is received), and Epistemic transparency (a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A is not a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A unless it is recognized as such by an idealized knowing subject). In Section 6 the sketch of a definition is proposed, according to which a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a sentence A is a cognitive state in which the subject has at his disposal a certain amount of information, and the hypothesis that A is the best explanation of that information. Section 7 shows how the notion defined escapes a crucial objection to defeasible justifications recently stated by P. Casalegno...|$|R
40|$|The lottery paradox {{occurs when}} we combine two {{plausible}} claims about epistemic justification: Probability claim: If A’s evidence makes p exceedingly likely, then A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p. Conjunction claim: If A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p, and A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing q, then A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p&q. 1 Clarification: I use “A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p ” and “A can justifiably believe p” equivalently {{to refer to}} the fact that A has ordinary outright (propositional) <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> an ordinary outright belief in p. The lottery paradox (Kyburg 1961, 197) : A knows that he is confronted with a fair lottery with a large number of tickets n one and only one of which will win. Assuming both the probability and the conjunction claim, we are forced to accept the paradoxical conclusion that even though A knows that one ticket will win, A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing that all tickets will lose: (1) JBl 1 &…&JBln, from probability claim (2) (JBp&JBq) →JB(p&q), conjunction claim (3) JB(l 1 &…&ln), from (1) and iterated applications of (2) Since (3) is clearly false, either (1) or (2) must be rejected.

5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he actually made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{some problems}} arising when {{the project of}} building a theory of meaning based {{on the notion of}} verification is extended beyond the mathematical domain, to cover empirical sentences. The central suggestion is to equate knowledge of the meaning of A with the capacity to decide the relation “x is a canonical <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A”. The theoretical notion of canonical <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A must be defined {{in such a way as}} to turn out to be decidable because the corresponding intuitive notion is epistemically transparent, in the sense that an intuitive <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A is not a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> A unless it is recognized as such by an idealized knowing subject...|$|R

5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> {{limiting}} parliamentary sovereignty: {{legitimacy and}} the current hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{treatment}} {{was used by}} William the Conqueror {{as one of the}} <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert {{was on his way to}} Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the Life of Saint Edward, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.|$|E

5|$|When the U.S. {{military}} was considering future {{operations in the}} Bonin Islands during August 1944 the planners assessed that an occupation of Iwo Jima might be necessary to protect the Marianas from attack, {{and after the war}} this was given as one of the <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> the costly invasion of the island. However, this was not necessary due {{to the success of the}} Seventh Air Force and the USN's campaign against Iwo Jima's airfields as well as the Japanese military's shortage of long-ranged aircraft. In any event, the decision to invade Iwo Jima was made a month before the major attacks on the B-29 bases began, and there were no raids on the Marianas in the seven weeks before the landings began on February19.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred {{at a time when}} the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public distraction from their illicit activities. Other explanations have included popular dissatisfaction with the election of divisive mayor Guy Willy Razanamasy or a flare-up of long-standing tensions among coastal peoples resentful of Merina socio-political domination. Accusations were also made against both then-president Albert Zafy and his predecessor, Didier Ratsiraka. The debate over why and how the Rova burned remains an unresolved and highly contentious subject decades later.|$|E

5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E
