25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>authorisation</b> to {{construct}} a railway on the Hoo Peninsula was obtained {{by a group of}} local businessmen who sponsored the passing of the North Kent Railway Extension Railway Act in 1865 which provided {{for the construction of a}} branch line leaving the South Eastern Railway's Gravesend - Strood line near Shorne Marshes. The line would head eastwards across land north of Cliffe to reach Allhallows, continuing to the Isle of Grain. However, the major railway companies operating in the area, South Eastern Railway (SER) and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) were not interested in the project and as a result it failed to secure the necessary funding.|$|E
50|$|Solicitor {{higher court}} {{advocacy}} has developed significantly since its <b>first</b> <b>authorisation</b> by the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Although {{only a handful}} of solicitors acquired higher rights as the first batch of advocates in 1994, they included some of the most senior figures in the legal establishment of the time, such as Sir David Napley, founding partner of Kingsley Napley. Approximately 4,000 advocates have since been authorised for crime, civil, or both. They represent a wide spectrum of experience.|$|E

5000|$|The {{signalling}} system is normally permissive: {{the driver of}} a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied block section without <b>first</b> obtaining <b>authorisation.</b> Speed is limited to 30 km/h, and if it exceeds 35 km/h the emergency brake is applied. If the board marking {{the entrance to the}} block section is accompanied by a sign marked Nf, non-franchissable (non-passable) the block section is not permissive, and the driver must obtain authorisation from the PAR, [...] "Poste d'Aiguillage et de Régulation" [...] (Signalling and Control Centre), before entering. Once a route is set or the PAR has provided authorisation, a white lamp above the board is lit to inform the driver. The driver acknowledges the authorisation by a button on the control panel. This disables the emergency braking, which would otherwise occur when passing over the ground loop adjacent to the Nf board.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signalling}} system is permissive; {{the driver of}} a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied block section without <b>first</b> obtaining <b>authorisation.</b> Speed in this situation is limited to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) and if speed exceeds 35 km/h (22 mph), the emergency brake is applied and the train stops. If the board marking {{the entrance to the}} block section is accompanied by a sign marked Nf, the block section is not permissive, and the driver must obtain authorisation from the Signalling and Control Centre (...) before entering the block. Once a route is set, or the signalling centre has provided authorisation, a white lamp below the marker board is lit to inform the driver. The driver then acknowledges the authorization using a button on the train's control panel. This temporarily overrides the emergency braking system, which would otherwise stop the train when proceeding past the non-permissive marker's ground loop.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 July 1935, at Heston Aerodrome, Stephen Appleby piloted {{the first}} flight of his HM.14 (G-ADMH), the first to fly in the UK. On 24 July 1935, the Air Ministry awarded it the <b>first</b> ever <b>Authorisation</b> to Fly document, being {{equivalent}} to a UK Certificate of Airworthiness with additional conditions and limitations. Following a forced landing, it was repaired with modifications designed by L.E. Baynes, at the factory of Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes. The modifications included a new 6 m span front wing with a repositioned wing pivot, a partial engine cowling, and a low-mounted radiator for the existing water-cooled Carden-Ford engine. The aircraft was later converted to replace the wing control cables with twin [...] "push-rods". Following the publicity of the aircraft and those personalities, many British HM.14s under construction acquired similar features. In April 1936, Baynes made improvements to the Flying Flea design, similar to those on Appleby's HM.14, plus further major modifications. Those included a 6.7 m newly designed front wing with two outboard wing pivots, that eliminated wing-bracing wires, hence the name Baynes Cantilever Pou. The prototype of that (G-AEGD), plus a later example (G-AEJD), were extensively test-flown and demonstrated by Appleby.|$|R

On 25 July 1935, he demonstrated the Flying Flea to the press, but force-landed it in a nearby ploughed field, where it came to rest inverted. Appleby attributed the accident to insufficient wing area and a high ambient air temperature. Sir John Carden, already acquainted with Appleby, offered to convert a Ford water-cooled engine for him that offered power of about 30 hp. The Daily Express newspaper had covered the construction of Appleby's Flying Flea, and it gave £100 for the aircraft to be repaired with modifications designed by L.E. Baynes, at the factory of Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes at Wrecclesham, near Farnham, Surrey. The modifications included a new 6 metres (20 ft) span front wing with a repositioned wing pivot, a partial engine cowling, and a low-mounted radiator for the newly converted Carden-Ford engine. On 12 September 1935, the rebuilt aircraft flew again at Heston. Soon after that, the aircraft was converted to replace the wing control cables with twin [...] "push-rods".|$|R
30|$|At this point, the <b>first</b> part of <b>authorisation</b> has finished, but OpenStack {{platform}} has {{an additional}} second authorisation step that is {{performed by the}} service. After consulting Keystone, Swift needs to evaluate the request against its own policies, for checking whether the user has permission to conduct the requested operation. The Swift PEP then activates Swift PDP to decide (7) whether the user can conduct the requested operation (e.g., upload a file). Swift PDP obtains the access control policies for the service (8 a) and uses the Swift PIP (8 b) to obtain any information that it needs for evaluating the access control policy. Once an access decision is granted (9), Swift PEP allows the user to perform the requested operation (represented by Step 10 towards the Object) {{and returns to the}} user a response to the request (Steps 11 and 12).|$|R
50|$|The London and Southampton Railway {{promoters}} {{had lost}} the <b>first</b> battle for <b>authorisation</b> to make a line to Bristol, but the objective of opening up {{the country in the}} South West and in the West Of England remained prominent. In fact it was an independent promoter, Charles Castleman, a solicitor of Wimborne, who assembled support in the South West, and on 2 February 1844 proposed to the LSWR that a line might be built from Southampton to Dorchester: he was rebuffed by the LSWR, who were looking towards Exeter as their next objective. Castleman went ahead and developed his scheme, but relations between his supporters and the LSWR were extremely tense, and Castleman formed a Southampton and Dorchester Railway, and negotiated with the Great Western Railway instead. The Bristol & Exeter Railway, a broad gauge company allied to the GWR, reached Exeter on 1 May 1844, and the GWR was promoting the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway which was to connect the GWR to Weymouth. It seemed to the LSWR that on all sides they were losing territory that they considered rightfully theirs, and they hastily prepared plans for their own lines crossing from Bishopstoke to Taunton. Much was made of the roundabout route of the Southampton and Dorchester line, and it was mockingly referred to as Castleman's corkscrew or the water snake.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, public {{awareness}} of unsafe and ineffective high-risk devices entering the market has been raised. Consequently, evidence requirements for the market authorisation process of medical devices {{may not be enough}} to ensure high-quality and safe provision of care. This research report <b>first</b> explores the <b>authorisation</b> systems for high-risk medical devices in four selected regions (USA, Canada, Australia and Europe). Secondly, it analyses the clinical evidence accessible at the time of both market approval and assessment (HTA) for the reimbursement of seven selected high-risk medical devices. Methods: A literature search in PubMed, complimented by a worldwide web-search, was conducted for authorisation systems and their evidence requirements in the four selected regions, with a focus on seven exemplary high-risk devices. Results: All seven medical devices have been approved in the European Union through an appointed Notified Body, only four by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), one each by the US-American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Canadian Therapeutics Products Directorate (TPD) respectively. In comparison to the other three regulatory systems, the number of approved devices in Europe is high, especially when taking into additional consideration that four further devices were also assessed by the FDA, but were either rejected or not approved for general use. In almost all of the seven analysed examples, the pre-market approval in Europe was granted 2 - 5 years before authorisation in other systems. The evidence used for CE-marking is not known due to its highly decentralised authorisation system and the lack of transparency. Since authorisation in Europe is granted earlier, the clinical evidence is naturally less mature. In contrast, none of the seven medical devices has so far been recommended for reimbursement. The pre-reimbursement assessments most often state that current evidence is not enough to ensure patient benefit and safety. Some devices are recommended for "research only". Discussion and conclusion: The results support the call for a change in the European authorisation system towards a transparent and evidence-based regulation process. Conditional coverage or coverage under evidence development is applied as an instrument to close the gap between immature data and reimbursement requirements...|$|R
