5|$|Criticism {{of the game}}'s {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Beshear {{announced}} six mandatory, unpaid furlough {{days for}} most state employees {{in order to}} achieve the savings called for by the budget. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the furlough for public safety and mental health care workers. The American Federation of County State and Municipal Employees (AFCSME) Council 62, which represents about 9,000 of Kentucky's state workers, filed suit to block implementation of the furloughs. A Franklin County Circuit Court Judge refused to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> injunction in September 2010, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. A month later, AFCSME agreed to drop the suit and address the furlough issue through Beshear's Employee Advisory Council. Ultimately, all six furlough days were observed as outlined in Beshear's plan.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{suggested}} {{reforms to}} the Order of Canada that would avert the awkwardness around appointing those in Canada's royal family as full {{members of the}} order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order's Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, their spouses, {{and members of the}} Royal Family, a version of which was adopted in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled {{over the}} {{question}} of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities.

Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications.|$|E

5|$|On 15 July, {{less than}} twelve {{hours before the}} book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail {{newspaper}} that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, {{would be seen as}} a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog; Richard Stallman called for a boycott, requesting the publisher <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> apology. The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning. Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The {{assassination}} {{precipitated the}} July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on {{suspicion that the}} assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally unacceptable to Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers {{in order to prevent}} the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same <b>issue,</b> <b>an</b> initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, {{as well as the}} sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.|$|E
5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Fronde, between 1650 and 1653, Louis, the Prince of Condé, {{controlled}} much of Paris {{alongside the}} Parlement, while Broussel, through his son, continued {{to control the}} Bastille. In July 1652, {{the battle of the}} Faubourg St Antoine took place just outside the Bastille. Condé had sallied out of Paris to prevent the advance of the royalist forces under the command of Turenne. Condé's forces became trapped against the city walls and the Porte Saint-Antoine, which the Parlement refused to open; he was coming under increasingly heavy fire from the Royalist artillery and the situation looked bleak. In a famous incident, La Grande Mademoiselle, the daughter of Gaston, the Duke of Orléans, convinced her father to <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> order for the Parisian forces to act, before she then entered the Bastille and personally ensured that the commander turned the fortress's cannon on Turenne's army, causing significant casualties and enabling Condé's army's safe withdrawal. Later in 1652, Condé was finally forced to surrender Paris to the royalist forces in October, effectively bringing the Fronde to an end: the Bastille returned to royal control.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Diarra {{struggled}} with a thigh injury and didn't appear {{with the team}} for almost three months. In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3–1 win over Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne appearing as a substitute. During the season, Diarra complained twice with regards to playing time, which led to Houllier equivocally questioning Diarra's ego. The feud culminated on 6 April when Houllier dropped Diarra from the squad to face Valenciennes the following day and then ordered him {{to play for the}} club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to play him {{for the rest of the}} season. The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should <b>issue</b> <b>an</b> apology to him and the team. The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Diarra returned to the team on 28 April playing the entire match in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. He repeated this feat in three of the team's last five matches as Lyon were crowned champions for the sixth consecutive season. Included in one of those three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3–0 victory over his former club Lens.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns.

They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the <b>issue,</b> <b>an</b> ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
