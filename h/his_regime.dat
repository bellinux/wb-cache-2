Qaddafi’s death and <b>his</b> <b>regime’s</b> end fractured a security structure that had brought some stability to Libya, Mali, Niger, and to a much lesser extent southern Algeria. Because of <b>his</b> <b>regime’s</b> demise, a new swathe of instability that comprises fractured, compromised, or failed states has emerged in the Sahelian region, giving ample opportunities to militant entrepreneurial groups that have organized and are inhibiting the re-creation of more stable states and societies...|$|R

Albania {{did not end}} its state of war with Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, Somerset's {{successor}} John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, {{was once}} regarded by historians {{merely as a}} grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the crown.

5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise <b>his</b> <b>regime.</b> Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 <b>his</b> <b>regime</b> spent $120 {{million on}} Soviet, French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} population would be involved in the CDR, and this would come to rise to 80%.|$|E
5|$|By 829, {{when the}} young emperor Theophilos ascended the Byzantine throne, the Byzantines and Arabs had been {{fighting}} {{on and off for}} almost two centuries. At this time, Arab attacks resumed both in the east, where after almost twenty years of peace due to the Abbasid civil war Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) launched several large-scale raids, and in the west, where the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily was under way since 827. Theophilos was an ambitious man and also a convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons. He sought to bolster <b>his</b> <b>regime</b> and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E

5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and <b>his</b> <b>regime</b> became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E

Over the following years, Superman becomes a ruthless tyrant who establishes a unified world government named the One Earth Regime that eliminates crime through a worldwide authoritarian regime, which he leads as its High Councillor, but Batman establishes an insurgency against <b>his</b> <b>regime,</b> and a war breaks out between the two factions, leaving the Justice League disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's use of {{propaganda}} {{contributed to his}} rise to power, legitimated <b>his</b> <b>régime,</b> and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship, controlling aspects of the press, books, theater, and art, {{was part of his}} propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to France. The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters {{reaching out to the}} leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize <b>his</b> <b>regime</b> by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up <b>his</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E
