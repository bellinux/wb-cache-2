Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250°C for 30 min) results in a 3-log reduction of endotoxin levels.

Nitrogen content was measured using a microkjeldahl apparatus (Labconco, Labconco Corporation, Kansas, Missouri, USA) and crude protein was estimated by multiplying nitrogen content by 6.25. Lipid content was determined by ether extraction in multi-unit extraction Soxhlet apparatus (Lab-Line Instruments, Inc., Melrose Park, Illinois, USA) for 16  hours.

Therefore, we functionalized surfaces with low-temperature inductively coupled oxygen plasma treatment, which in first stage cleaned surface of titanium, and in second promoted incorporation of oxygen functional groups as well as growth of titanium dioxide film. In this presentation, we show that oxygen atoms or oxygen containing groups play important role in repulsion of platelets and their deactivation. At the same time, increased surface temperature of samples either through sequential thermal deactivation in a <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> at 150 oC or heating the surface with ion bombardment during the treatment, lowers the oxygen content and the surface repulsion for platelets. 1...|$|E

A descriptive study was made of how Public Dental Medicine Colleges in Brazil process critical materials and determine the patterns of physical, chemical and biological control {{in their use of}} hot air ovens and autoclaves to sterilize these materials. The data were obtained with a questionnaire, sent by mail and analyzed with the software EPI-INFO 6. 04. Among the 40 Brazilian public Dental Medicine Colleges, only 16 returned the questionnaire. In eight of these, the individuals responsible for the materials and sterilization center had a college degree in a human health field. In 14 institutions, the students were responsible for the cleaning of the instruments, but in six of these they did so outside of the materials and sterilization center. Both the autoclave and the dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were the method of choice in 13 of the 16 schools. The sterilization routine was routinely monitored by 11 of the institutions. Chemical control through the tape test in the autoclave was used by 13 of the schools, three institutions reported preventive maintenance, and biological indicators were used by seven of the 16 schools. Autoclaves are widely used because of the degree of biological security that this method offers, however physical, chemical and biological controls have not been routinely implemented by most of the institutions...|$|E

Experiment on drying of pisang salai was conducted in the laboratory of the Faculty of Agro and Natural Resources, University of Malaysia Kelantan. This experiment was aimed at studying the differences between sun drying and oven used for drying technique to produce pisang salai. By oven drying was found to be much faster and cleaner. In addition, sun drying technique is not suitable for the production of pisang salai in large quantities and has slower rate in drying besides pisang salai easily exposed to the risk of contamination by dust, insects and other dirt and unstable weather factor. In the study, {{it was found that the}} temperature 60 ° C was suitable for pisang salai drying. In addition, this experiment can also be used as a first step to commercialize products based on bananas in the local community. With this study, efforts to develop small industry in particular among the villagers will be able to help the economy than to give them returns. In addition, this study can be seen more on the application of technology in the production of banana-based food products.

40|$|Objectives. In dental offices, {{sterilization}} {{of instruments}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects of infection control. Autoclave effectiveness in killing microorganisms can be verified by spore tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sterilization procedures of private dental offices in Hong Kong, and to test the effectiveness of their autoclaves using biological indicators. Methods. Packages of an 18 -item questionnaire and two biological indicators were sent to 402 private dental practices in Hong Kong. They were instructed to complete the questionnaire, and perform a spore test in their autoclave using the biological indicators and return them for incubation. Results. One hundred and eighty-two practices responded, with a response rate of 45 %. Excluding three imcomplete questionnaires and four practices using dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven,</b> a total of 175 autoclaves were tested. Thirteen (7 %) of the autoclaves failed the initial spore test. Twelve of these practices performed a re-test, whereupon two (1 %) of the autoclaves failed again. Among these 175 autoclaves, 77 (44 %) were the Fuji Elite model. The commonest (n= 72; 41 %) packing material and method entailed sterilization pouches. Twenty-three (13 %) of the respondents used improper sterilization time/temperature conditions for processing the instruments. For autoclaves older than 1 year, only 38 % (n= 58) had been serviced in the last year. One hundred and nine (62 %) of the respondents used chemical indicators and only seven (4 %) used biological indicators to monitor sterilization. Conclusion. Autoclaves in private dental practice in Hong Kong should be regularly checked, and their effectiveness routinely monitored. The use of biological indicators to monitor the sterilization was uncommon and knowledge about proper autoclaves usage needs improving. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

Concluiu que, provavelmente, apenas 48, 1 % das estufas da Grande Florianópolis estavam operando segundo as normas de tempo e temperatura preconizadas na {{literatura}} e pode constatar que houve falha de 22, 5 % na eficácia das 40 estufas da amostra testada. Abstract : The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of dry heat dental offices in Florianópolis, S. C., Brazil. The work intended to discover the capacity dry heat ovens have to eradicate the spores of B. subtilis on biological indicators strips and also to compare temperatures during the sterilization cycles to the ones proposed in the literature. Moreover, it endeavored to assure that the built in thermometer and thermostat in the dry <b>heat</b> <b>oven</b> were reliable, and to analyze the influence how the materials were displayed in the sterilization chambers. As a complementing part, a survey was made in order to investigate who operates the dry heat ovens in different dental clinics and their specialist field of work. The results indicated that, out of the samples tested, a rate fall of 22. 5 % was found in dry heat ovens effectiveness to destroy the spores of R subtilis. Moreover, from the final results, it is possible to infer that only 48. 1 % of the dry heat ovens investigated actually used the parameters (time and temperatare) as proposed in the literature. From the observed samples, it was also shown that the built in thermometers and thermostat were not reliable. Furthermore, results suggested that there was temperature variation inside the dry heat ovens, therefore, it was found that the materials placed in the upper shelf received less heat. Finally, findings confirmed that dental assistants were responsible for managing the dry heat ovens in 67. 5 % of the dental offices surveyed. Last but no least, although there was a vast area of specialists participating in the survey, such as periodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, implantodontics, pedodontics, and radiology, general clinics showed to have participated with the highest percentage (57. 5 %) ...|$|E
