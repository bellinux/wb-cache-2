40|$|In this work, the stents-induced {{mechanical}} {{responses of}} a patient-specific common carotid artery (CCA) were evaluated through computational simulation. The realistic 3 D {{geometry of the}} artery was constructed from the MRI data. Two types of self-expanding stent design (open-cell and closed-cell) were used to restore the blood flow inside the 60 % stenosed artery. The resulting lumen gain, <b>dog-boning</b> effect and arterial stress were estimated. Results suggested that the artery was straightened after stent implantation, and the open-cell design led to bigger lumen gain, better conformability, and less <b>dog-boning</b> effect.

40|$|In this work, a glass/epoxy {{material}} system commonly {{applied in}} wind turbine design {{was used to}} evaluate damage processes brought by water ingression during service life. Composite short-beams and neat epoxy beams and <b>dog-bones</b> were conditioned by water immersion at 50 ◦ until saturation and tested both statically and in fatigue. By comparing results from mechanical tests with those from reference specimens, significant fibre-matrix interface damage was identified, with reductions of up to 34 % on the static strength and fatigue life reduction of up to three orders of magnitude. On the other hand, neat epoxy specimens showed a lower degree of damage, with up to 20 % lower moduli and strength proper-ties. Microscopic observations of conditioned specimens point out to extensive debonding on composite specimens after immersion, while neat epoxy specimens show signs of colour changes possibly due to hydrolytic attack. Lastly, changes in the glass transition temperature of the resin due to water ingression are assessed through the DMA technique. From the results, apart from a Tg reduction brought by mate-rial degradation, additional relaxation peaks brought by phase changes in the absorbed water molecules were identified. ...|$|R

50|$|Material to {{be tested}} must be cut to a {{specific}} shape so as to fit the grips, most usually {{in the form of}} a <b>dog-bone</b> shape when flat sheet is being tested. The sheet is cut or machined to shape, and great care is needed to create a smooth edge. If defects are left, the result may be premature failure from the defect, thus underestimating tensile strength. Different shaped samples need different grip designs to achieve their objective. Fibres for example, require rod grips around which fibre can be wound prior to straining. Product tests may even need special grips to be designed owing to the shape variability of complex products.|$|E

The results show that with the increase in the apical dislocation of <b>dog-bone</b> (LA), the slab spread and the minimum crop end loss at slab head and tail decrease, while the lost width at slab head and tail increases.

40|$|Hot tearing {{propensity}} in {{aluminium alloys}} is commonly measured using <b>dog-bone</b> and ring tests. Hot tearing occurs {{as a result}} of a number of factors including; level of stress and strain, hot spots and nucleation sites. This paper presents the results of a study to redesign a <b>dog-bone</b> type hot tear test using casting simulation software to ensure that the location of the tearing was always in the same location. In the simulation of the original five fingered die both the stress and strain were sufficiently high for hot tearing but there was no defined hot spot implying that the random hot tear locations would result depending upon suitable nucleation sites. A number of design iterations were carried out to produce more focussed hot spots and to ensure that the die was easy to manufacture and use, and was economically viable...|$|E
40|$|Gigacycle fatigue {{properties}} of materials are strongly affected by the specimen risk volume (region subjected to a stress amplitude above the 90 % of the maximum stress). Gigacycle fatigue tests, performed with ultrasonic fatigue testing machines, are commonly carried out by using hourglass shaped specimens with a small risk volume. The adoption of traditional <b>dog-bone</b> specimens allows for increasing the risk volume, but the increment is however limited. In order to obtain larger risk volumes, a new specimen shape is proposed (Gaussian specimen). The <b>dog-bone</b> and the Gaussian specimens are compared through Finite Element Analyses. The range of applicability of the two different specimens in terms of available risk volume and stress concentration effects due to the cross section variation is determined. Finally, the Finite Element model is validated experimentally by means of strain gages measurement...|$|E

The addition of the CPC also reduced fretting corrosion at the faying surfaces and shifted the fatigue initiation sites closer to the edge of fastener holes. Scatter in fatigue life was found {{to be associated with the}} location and size of the intermetallics at the initiation site. The presence of corrosion in the bores of the countersunk fastener holes reduced the fatigue life by up to one order of magnitude. Fatigue test results for <b>dog-bone</b> specimens manufactured from 7075 -T 651 and 2024 -T 351 aluminium alloys indicated that the presence of exfoliation corrosion reduced the fatigue life under dry conditions, with a greater reduction under humid conditions.

In recent years, Vic- 2 D has been increasingly utilized in packaging industry. It is able to break through certain technical limitations of traditional strain testing method and provide a comprehensive strain map that can be suitable for any case of mechanical testing and obtaining the most desired results in the shortest period of time. In this study, tensile tests are conducted to compare operational performance and functional completeness of conventional mechanical analyzes software, BLUEHILL, with VIC- 2 D technique. Tensile test is a commonly used method for obtaining strain parameters and mechanical properties of packaging materials.

40|$|Recirculating Linear Accelerators (RLA's) {{provide a}} compact and {{efficient}} way of accelerating particle beams {{to medium and}} high energies by reusing the same linac for multiple passes. In the conventional scheme, after each pass, the different energy beams {{coming out of the}} linac are separated and directed into appropriate arcs for recirculation, with each pass requiring a separate fixed-energy arc. In this paper we present a concept of an RLA return arc based on linear combined-function magnets, in which two and potentially more consecutive passes with very different energies are transported through the same string of magnets. By adjusting the dipole and quadrupole components of the constituting linear combined-function magnets, the arc is designed to be achromatic and to have zero initial and final reference orbit offsets for all transported beam energies. We demonstrate the concept by developing a design for a droplet-shaped return arc for a <b>dog-bone</b> RLA capable of transporting two beam passes with momenta different by a factor of two.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and rate of}} development of early-age deformation of concrete is often not known reliably and restraint to shrinkage is often poorly modelled in structural design. In order to accurately quantify the early-age deformational characteristics of Australian concrete, including shrinkage and tensile creep, a comprehensive experimental program is underway at the Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Safety at UNSW Australia, where a series of experiments have been performed to quantify the early-age properties of concrete. A restrained cracking test was devised and reinforced concrete prisms were tested in tension under sustained loading to measure tensile creep and restrained shrinkage. Free shrinkage was measured on companion unreinforced prism specimens. <b>Dog-bone</b> shaped specimens were also tested in direct tension in portable creep rigs. All the specimens were tested at a stress-strength level of 50 % of the tensile strength of concrete {{at the age of}} 2 days. It was found that RC prisms cracked with time under sustained tension before reaching the instantaneous tensile strength of concrete. A strength reduction factor of 0. 7 and 0. 87 was observed based on split tensile strength and direct tensile strength, respectively.

40|$|As a {{solution}} of high efficiency and clean energy, fuel cell technologies, especially proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), have caught extensive attention. However, after decades of development, the performances of PEMFCs are far from achieving the target from the Department of Energy (DOE). Thus, further understanding of the degradation mechanism is needed to overcome this obstacle. Due {{to the importance of}} proton exchange membrane in a PEMFC, the degradation of the membrane, such as hygrothermal aging effect on its properties, are particularly necessary. In this work, a thick membrane (Nafion N 117), which is always used as an ionic polymer for the PEMFCs, has been analyzed. Experimental investigation is performed for understanding the mechanical endurance of the bare membranes under different loading conditions. Tensile tests are conducted to compare the mechanical property evolution of two kinds of bare-membrane specimens including the <b>dog-bone</b> and the deeply double edge notched (DDEN) types. Both <b>dog-bone</b> and DDEN specimens were subjected to a series of degradation tests with different cycling times and wide humidity ranges. The tensile tests are repeated for both kinds of specimens to assess the strain-stress relations. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and water absorption measurement were conducted to speculate the cause of this variation.

Anisotropic plastic deformation {{is characterized by}} uniaxial tensile tests of <b>dog-bone</b> specimens, while anisotropy in ductile fracture is illustrated with specimens with a central hole, notched specimens and shear specimens. All these specimens are cut off at every 15 º from the rolling direction. The r-values and uniaxial tensile yield stresses are measured from the tensile tests of <b>dog-bone</b> specimens. Then the anisotropic plasticity is modeled by a newly proposed J 2 -J 3 criterion under non-associate flow rule (non-AFR).

Modeling of shear ductile fracture considering a changeable cut-off value for stress triaxiality. Int. J. Plasticity 54, 56 - 80) for different loading directions. It is demonstrated that the anisotropic plastic deformation is described by the J 2 -J 3 criterion with high accuracy in various loading conditions including shear, uniaxial tension and plane strain tension.
