5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> such as {{encroachment}} of settlements, agriculture, {{and hunting}} {{in rural areas}} {{poses a threat to}} the Natal red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds {{and humans}} {{have a long}} history together: they have {{provided}} food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by <b>human</b> <b>activities,</b> and conservation efforts are under way.|$|E
50|$|At present <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> uses up more {{resources}} than our planet can provide. As a result, we need 1.3 planets to support <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> and conserve species and ecosystems {{that are in}} danger.|$|R
50|$|This {{increased}} {{interaction with}} <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> can clearly {{be seen on}} the varying strategies adopted by the wasp colonies. In habitats more altered by <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> 60% of yellow paper wasp nests occur on human constructions and 40% occur on trees. In contrast, in habitats less altered by <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> 100% of the nests are found in trees, even if there are buildings nearby. In the habitats less altered by <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> there is a significant positive correlation between the number of cells constructed and the number of adults produced, as well as between the diameter of the petiole and the nest dry mass. In these colonies, the population increases proportionally with the size of the nest. This similar increase is not seen as clearly in habitats more altered by <b>human</b> <b>activity.</b> This may be because in environments with more <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> a larger nest may attract more attention and is therefore more likely to be eliminated. The yellow paper wasps may have adapted to this situation, preferring to reuse cells instead of increasing the size of the nest.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the public}} is {{out of step with}} the {{scientific}} community, with 41% believing that climate change is being caused by both <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> and natural processes. 46% believe <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> is the main cause.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel are {{threatened}} by <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. <b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from <b>human</b> <b>activities,</b> following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E

40|$|National {{parks are}} {{important}} for conservation of species such as wolves (Canis lupus) and elk (Cervus canadensis). However, topography, vegetation conditions, and anthropogenic infrastructure within parks may limit available habitat. <b>Human</b> <b>activity</b> on trails and roads may lead to indirect habitat loss, further limiting available habitat. Predators and prey may respond differentially to <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> potentially disrupting ecological processes. However, research on such impacts to wildlife is incomplete, especially at fine spatial and temporal scales. Our research investigated the relationship between wolf and elk distribution and <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> using fine-scale Global Positioning System (GPS) wildlife telemetry locations and hourly <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> measures on trails and roads in Banff, Kootenay, and Yoho National Parks, Canada. We observed a complex interaction between the distance animals were located from trails and <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> level resulting in species adopting both mutual avoidance and differential response behaviors. In areas < 50 m from trails <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> led to a mutual avoidance response by both wolves and elk. In areas 50 - 400 m from trails low levels of <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> led to differential responses; wolves avoided these areas, whereas elk appeared to use these areas as a predation refugia. These differential impacts on elk and wolves may {{have important implications for}} trophic dynamics. As <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> increased above two people/hour, areas 50 - 400 m from trails were mutually avoided by both species, resulting in the indirect loss of important montane habitat. If park managers are concerned with human impacts on wolves and elk, or on these species&# 039; trophic interactions with other species, they can monitor locations near trails and roads and consider hourly changes of <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> levels in areas important to wildlife...|$|R

5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub or <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{scientific}} consensus linking <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> {{to global warming}} due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

5|$|Thirty-eight {{species are}} {{threatened}} with extinction {{as a result}} of <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade.

30|$|On average, {{there were}} 16.2 people (57.7 S.D.), and 1.6 dogs (57.7 S.D.) (81 % unleashed, despite posted leash laws) per km of beach. Silverstrand {{had the most}} <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> (88 people and 2.4 dogs per km), whereas Ormond 2 had the least (2.1 people and 0.1 dogs per km). <b>Human</b> <b>activity</b> was {{positively}} associated with {{the proportion of the}} beach that was fronted by housing development and varied by month, with most activity occurring during August and the least in May (Table 4). <b>Human</b> <b>activity</b> appeared to negatively affect some types of birds on beaches. The richness of shorebirds (Table 6) and other waterbirds (Table 9) was negatively associated with short-term effects of <b>human</b> <b>activity,</b> as measured by the sum of humans and dogs counts. The abundance of shorebirds (Table 3) and other waterbirds (Table 12) was marginally negatively associated with <b>human</b> <b>activity.</b> However, neither measure of gulls (Table 8, Table 7) nor of land birds (Table 13, Table 11) was associated with <b>human</b> <b>activity.</b> The statistical models estimated that one bird species (Table 1) was displaced by nine humans (or dogs) per kilometer. Repeating the analysis of McCrary and Pierson (2000) for our data, but focusing on their focal shorebird species, there were negative associations between the average amount of <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> on a beach and the average shorebird abundance (Table 4) and richness (Table 5) on a beach.|$|R
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>activity</b> {{recognition}} {{has gained}} {{more interest in}} several research communities given that understanding user activities and behavior helps to deliver proactive and personalized services.

Different types of noise in wearable sensors data frequently hamper the <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> recognition classification process. In order to develop a successful activity recognition system, it is necessary to use stable and robust machine learning techniques capable of dealing with noisy data. In this paper, we presented the artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) technique to the <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> recognition community.
