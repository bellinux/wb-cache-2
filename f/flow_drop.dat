C. has also been seen by some scholars {{as a sign of}} a martial aspect of Sancus. Roger D. Woodard has interpreted Sancus as the Roman equivalent of Vedic god Indra, who has to rely on the help of the Maruts, in his view corresponding to the twelfth Roman semones of the carmen Arvale, in his task of killing the dragon Vrtra thus freeing the waters and averting draught. He traces the etymology of Semo to IE stemroot *she(w) bearing the meanings of to pour, ladle, <b>flow,</b> <b>drop</b> related to rain and sowing. In Roman myth Hercules would represent this mythic character in his killing of the monstre Cacus. Sancus would be identical to Hercules and strictly related, though not identical, to Mars as purported by the old cults of the Salii of Tibur related by Varro and other ancient authors cited by Macrobius. The tricephalous deity represented near Hercules in Etruscan tombs and reflected in the wise of the killing of Cacus would correspond to the features of the monster killed by Indra in association with Trita Āpya.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the changes in rainfall-runoff characteristics in the year prior to and after intensive thinning of 50 % in number in a steep headwater catchment, covered with 46 -year-old Japanese cedar and cypress in western Japan. The magnitude of event peak flow, event quick flow, event water yield, and event response time did not change after thinning. Because 70 % of rainfall events had multiple flow peaks, relationships between each flow peak and the rainfall just prior to that peak were also analyzed. The increases in accumulated quick flow, flow rise and <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> were significant after thinning. The <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> following each flow peak increased, {{and led to a}} lower initial flow in subsequent peaks, resulting in no increase in peak size. The flow peaks in events with over 30 mm rainfall amount and over 2 mm/h average rainfall intensity showed significant increases in flow peak, flow rise, <b>flow</b> <b>drop,</b> and accumulated quick flow, which suggests that the catchment exhibited more shallow flow paths during large rainfall amounts after thinning. No changes were identified using event-based analysis, but changes in flow peaks were detected, which indicates the importance of examining all flow peaks when investigating rainfall-runoff characteristics of headwater catchments...|$|E

40|$|Four {{different}} types of coal have been pyrolyzed in a laminar <b>flow,</b> <b>drop</b> tube furnace {{in order to establish}} a relationship between polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) evolution and mutagenicity. Temperatures of 900 K to 1700 K and particle residence times up to 0. 3 sec were chosen to best simulate conditions of rapid rate pyrolysis in pulverized (44 - 53 microns) coal combustion. The specific mutagenic activity (i. e., the activity per unit sample weight) of extracts from particulates and volatiles captured on XAD- 2 resin varied with coal type according to the order: subbituminous greater than high volatile bituminous greater than lignite greater than anthracite. Total mutagenic activity (the activity per gram of coal pyrolyzed), however, varied with coal type according to the order: high volatile bituminous much greater than subbituminous = lignite much greater than anthracite, due primarily to high organic yield during high volatile bituminous coal pyrolysis.

30|$|In [20], {{the authors}} {{proposed}} a probe-based call admission control scheme (ProbeCast) with QoS guarantees for inelastic flows (i.e., flows that cannot be dynamically adjusted to traffic and load condition). In ProbeCast, a path is probed for capacity availability. If an intermediate link along the probed path fails {{to meet the}} QoS requirement, the flow is ‘pushed back’ via backpressure upstream to an intermediate branch or possibly to the source. To achieve this, the probing scheme {{is associated with a}} distributed fairness scheme, Neighborhood Proportional Drop, which enforces uniform drop probabilities among flows competing in the same contention domain. Each node estimates own packet drop probability and propagates this information by piggybacking to neighbors. The received flow has, by design, a lower drop probability threshold than the serving flows. If during probing, the new <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> rate increases beyond a certain threshold, the flow is back-pressured {{on the way to the}} source node and the flow is re-routed. If backpressure pushes the flow back to the source and all alternate paths are exhausted, the received flow is rejected. ProbeCast works well in small network density; however, the scalability in terms of network density and mobility is not guaranteed and the interference issue is not considered.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether ramp meters increase the capacity of active freeway bottlenecks, and if they do, how. The traffic flow characteristics at twenty-seven active bottlenecks in the Twin Cities have been studied for seven weeks without ramp metering and seven weeks with ramp metering. A series of hypotheses regarding the relationships between ramp metering and the capacity of active bottlenecks are developed and tested against empirical traffic data. It is found that meters increase the bottleneck capacity by postponing and sometimes eliminating bottleneck activations (a 73 % increase in the duration of the pre-queue transition period), accommodating higher (2 %) flows during the pre-queue transition period, and increasing queue discharge flow rates after breakdown (3 %). The two-capacity hypothesis about <b>flow</b> <b>drops</b> after breakdown was also examined and results strongly suggest the percentage <b>flow</b> <b>drops</b> at various bottlenecks follow a normal distribution (mean 5. 5 %, standard deviation 2. 3 %).

40|$|We {{address the}} ability of broad iron {{emission}} lines from black hole accretion disks to diagnose the spin of the black hole. Using a high-resolution 3 -dimensional MHD simulation of a geometrically-thin accretion disk in a Pseudo-Newtonian potential, we show that both the midplane density and the vertical column density of the accretion <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> dramatically over a narrow range of radii close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We argue that this drop of density {{is accompanied by a}} sharp increase in the ionization parameter of the X-ray photosphere, and that the resulting imprint of the ISCO on the X-ray reflection spectrum can be used to constrain spin. Motivated by this simulation, we construct a simplified toy-model of the accretion flow within the ISCO of a Kerr black hole, and use this model to estimate the systematic error on inferred black hole spin that may result from slight bleeding of the iron line emission to the region inside of the ISCO. We find that these systematic errors can be significant for slowly spinning black holes but become appreciably smaller as one considers more rapidly rotating black holes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} rain on freeway flow {{breakdown}} behavior is investigated. Three aspects of flow breakdown are analyzed for rain versus no rain (clear) weather conditions. First, {{the probability of}} breakdown occurrence is examined by analyzing the distribution of prebreakdown flow rates observed immediately {{before the onset of}} traffic breakdown by using a survival analysis approach. At all study sections, a reduction with prebreakdown flow rates is observed under rain conditions compared with distributions under no rain and confirms higher breakdown likelihoods at lower flows. Log likelihood ratio tests confirm the statistical significance of differences in the prebreakdown flow rate distribution parameters under rain compared with clear conditions. Second, breakdown duration is examined by estimating a semiparametric Cox proportional hazard model. With a rain event indicator set as an independent variable, the effect of rain on breakdown duration is observed. Rain during a breakdown episode is found to increase its duration, whereas rain before breakdown does not appear to affect duration. Finally, prebreakdown and postbreakdown flow rates are compared. Overall, while a reduction in prebreakdown flow rates is observed because of rain, the <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> between prebreakdown and postbreakdown is not much different between rain (3. 9 % to 12. 0 %) and no rain (7. 8 % to 12. 7 %) conditions...|$|E

Fine ash particles are formed during coal combustion in power stations and, if not collected in the air pollution control devices, are emitted into the atmosphere. The fine ash particles can remain airborne for long periods and can result in deleterious health effects when inhaled and deposited in the lungs.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method to {{estimate}} the macroscopic volume delay function (VDF) from the point speed-flow measures. Contrary to typical VDF estimation methods it allows estimating speeds also for hypercritical traffic conditions, when both speeds and <b>flow</b> <b>drop</b> due to congestion (high density of traffic flow). We employ the well-known hydrodynamic relation of fundamental diagram to derive the so-called quasi-density from measured time-mean speeds and flows. This allows formulating the VDF estimation problem with a speed being monotonically decreasing function of quasi-density with a shape resembling the typical VDF like BPR. This way {{we can use the}} actually observed speeds and propose the macroscopic VDF realistically reproducing actual speeds also for hypercritical conditions. The proposed method is illustrated with half-year measurements from the induction loop system in city of Warsaw, which measured traffic flows and instantaneous speeds of over 5 million vehicles. Although the proposed method does not overcome the fundamental limitations of static macroscopic traffic models, which cannot represent dynamic traffic phenomena like queue, spillback, wave propagation, capacity drop, and so forth, we managed to improve the VDF goodness-of-fit from R 2 of 27 % to 72 % most importantly also for hypercritical conditions. Thanks to this traffic congestion in macroscopic traffic models can be reproduced more realistically in line with empirical observations...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: OSA is {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease, and it may have serious consequences. Its recognition may have important implications during the perioperative period. Increased upper airway collapsibility {{is one of the main}} determinants of OSA, and its evaluation could be useful for identifying this condition. METHODS: Severe OSA and normal subjects (24 in each group) were matched by body mass index and referred to our sleep laboratory. The subjects were enrolled in an overnight sleep study, and a diurnal negative expiratory pressure test was performed. <b>Flow</b> <b>drop</b> (DV) and expiratory volume were measured in the first 0. 2 s (V 02) of the negative expiratory pressure test. RESULTS: DV (%) and V 02 (%) values were statistically different between normal and OSA subjects. OSA patients showed a greater decrease in flow than normal subjects. In addition, severely OSA patients exhaled during the first 0. 2 s of the negative expiratory pressure application was an average of only 11. 2 % of the inspired volume compared to 34. 2 % for the normal subjects. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristics showed that V 02 (%) and DV (%) could accurately identify severe OSA in subjects with sensitivities of 95. 8 % and 91. 7 %, respectively, and specificities of 95. 8 % and 91. 7 %, respectively.
