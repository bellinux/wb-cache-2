I think that's the highest moment, {{whatever}} it may be, with my talent." [...] He drew upon inspiration for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from Picasso's [...] "Guernica", which depicts war-ravaged villagers. Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail wrote that Steiger's character [...] "seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man". Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of anti-Semitism, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin.|$|E

A reviewer at Contactmusic.com describes the single version of [...] "Son of Three" [...] as [...] "special", and for NMEs Stephen Dalton, it is a [...] "jewel".

500|$|Following the announcement, USC Interactive Media Division withdrew its {{sponsorship}} of the festival. Seven of the fourteen finalist games {{were removed from the}} contest by their developers in protest: Braid, flOw, Once Upon A Time, Toblo, Everyday Shooter, Book and Volume and Castle Crashers (Toblo was later reinstated by the DigiPen Institute of Technology, who owns the rights to the game). Developer Jonathan Blow of Braid stated: [...] " [...] lacks compassion, and <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Artist's Statement disingenuous. But despite this, the game does have redeeming value. It does provoke important thoughts, and it does push the boundaries of what games are about. It is composed with more of an eye toward art than most games. Clearly, it belongs at the festival." [...] Blow and the other developers sent an open letter to the festival, encouraging the reinstatement of the game as keeping with the festival's [...] "trailblazing" [...] efforts. Despite protests, Baxter refused to change his mind, citing consideration for the shooting's victims and their families. Ledonne told the other finalists that he planned to go to the festival anyway and distribute copies of the game. Acknowledging that the withdrawal of six finalists compromised the competition, Roberts let the attendees vote on whether any prizes would be awarded; they decided not to.|$|E

During an argument, Lois reveals that Jerome had bought Peter a gift, and he goes on to apologize to Jerome for being so insensitive. Jerome forgives him and he remains friends with Peter, but admits to having had sex with Meg, to which Peter indifferently responds.|$|E
