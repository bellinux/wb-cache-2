This Recommendation, which was subsequently endorsed by the EU Council of Ministers (July 2013), sets out a common European Framework for tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting child well-being. The European Commission asked the European Social Policy Network (ESPN) to prepare country reports and an overall Synthesis Report on the implementation of the Recommendation since its adoption in 2013. The reports are also intended to help the Commission and Member States in setting priorities for implementing the principles in relation to children in the Pillar of Social Rights and to inform the discussion on establishing a <b>European</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Guarantee.</b> This report details the national findings from the United Kingdom...|$|E

40|$|Amphibious {{vision is}} {{accomplished}} in many animals by special optical and physiological adaptations in the eyes. However, human eyes {{are considered to}} be adapted to a life in air since our curved outer cornea – which is used to refract {{more than two-thirds of the}} incoming light on land – becomes useless underwater. This thesis produces evidence that Moken children, a population of sea nomads (or sea-gypsies) from Southeast Asia, have developed an underwater visual acuity that is more than twice as good as that of <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> They achieve this by heavy accommodation and concurrent pupil constriction underwater, a reaction absent in <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> This skill is most likely learned since this thesis also shows that <b>European</b> <b>children</b> can be trained to achieve the same level of acuity underwater as the Moken <b>children.</b> <b>European</b> <b>children</b> learned to control their accommodation in only 4 - 6 months, depending on the individual. Experiments were also made to determine whether the physiological diving response is involved in the process of pupil constriction underwater, but the results were negative. The Moken children constrict their pupils even when diving with goggles, a reaction also present in trained <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> In untrained <b>European</b> <b>children</b> however, this pupil constriction is absent. It is possible that training affects the connection between the accommodative response and pupil constriction so that it becomes a conditioned response elicited when the children immerse their heads in water. Furthermore, optical theory is used to predict underwater acuity in humans. Considering that the normal ranges of contrast sensitivity vary a great deal between individuals, the experimental values of underwater acuity are well within the range of values predicted theoretically...|$|R

40|$|ArticleCopyright © 2013 {{copyright}} Taylor & Francis. This paper highlights {{an important}} lacuna within critiques of infantilizing (neo-) colonial European discourses: {{the failure to}} question whom or what was the ‘child’ against which non-Europeans were gauged. The premise is that the unacknowledged figure {{at the heart of}} these critiques is in fact the figure of the universalised, <b>European</b> <b>child.</b> Not only is this paradoxical, it also opens the potential for taking these critiques further, and for shifting the analytical lens away from the racialized, infantilized Other in order to challenge the assumed universality of European notions of childhood against which the Other was, and sometimes remains, positioned. We develop this critique through a sympathetic engagement with broader postcolonial writings on the subject of infantilization and, specifically, with Dipesh Chakrabarty’s Provincializing Europe (2000). The paper reveals the paradoxical presence of the figure of the <b>European</b> <b>child</b> within Chakrabarty’s critique of Eurocentrism, arguing that this figure is present even as Chakrabarty seeks to provincialize Europe. The paper explores examples of the work that the figure of the universal <b>European</b> <b>child</b> continues to perform and concludes with some reflections on what it might mean to provincialize the <b>European</b> <b>child,</b> both for postcolonial theory and for the broader ethical issues this raises.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary {{health care}} workers have {{reported}} an impression that asthma is commoner among Asian than <b>European</b> <b>children,</b> and a cross sectional survey was designed to compare the prevalence in Asian and <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> METHODS: The survey {{was carried out in}} children aged 7 - 11 in eight primary schools in Southampton. Four schools contained predominantly <b>children</b> of <b>European</b> ancestry, two contained predominantly Asian children, and two contained a mixture of ethnic groups. Data were collected by means of parent completed questionnaire on recent asthma symptoms, diagnosis, morbidity, and treatment from 759 European and 274 Asian children. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported wheeze in the previous 12 months was higher among European (19. 6 %) than Asian children (11. 9 %), as was the prevalence of a night cough (European 64. 2 %, Asian 42. 3 %). Although the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was higher in European (12 %) than Asian (6. 2 %) children, a slightly higher proportion of Asian than <b>European</b> <b>children</b> with current wheeze had visited their doctor (European 66. 9 %, Asian 78. 1 %, not significant) or been admitted to hospital for wheezing (European 4. 8 %, Asian 6. 5 %) in the previous 12 months.

40|$|AbstractHumans {{are poorly}} adapted for {{underwater}} vision. In air, the curved corneal surface accounts for {{two-thirds of the}} eye's refractive power, and this is lost when air is replaced by water [1]. Despite this, some tribes of sea gypsies in Southeast Asia live off the sea, and the children collect food from the sea floor {{without the use of}} visual aids [2]. This is a remarkable feat when one considers that the human eye is not focused underwater and small objects should remain unresolved. We have measured the visual acuity of children in a sea gypsy population, the Moken, and found that the children see much better underwater than one might expect. Their underwater acuity (6. 06 cycles/degree) is more than twice as good as that of <b>European</b> <b>children</b> (2. 95 cycles/degree). Our investigations show that the Moken children achieve their superior underwater vision by maximally constricting the pupil (1. 96 mm compared to 2. 50 mm in <b>European</b> <b>children)</b> and by accommodating to the known limit of human performance (15 – 16 D) [3]. This extreme reaction—which is routine in Moken children—is completely absent in <b>European</b> <b>children.</b> Because they are completely dependent on the sea, the Moken are very likely to derive great benefit from this strategy...|$|R
