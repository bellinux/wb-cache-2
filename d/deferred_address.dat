40|$|This policy brief {{looks into}} the {{recently}} released Asian century white paper and the impact this will have on Australian aid in Asia. Key Points - The lack of substantive discussion on aid policy probably reflects uncertainty within the Australian government about {{how to respond to}} two fundamental issues related to Australia’s aid to Asia. The first of these is whether it is appropriate, or even possible, for the Australian government to continue increasing aid to developing countries in Asia. The second issue is how to engage with Asian countries in relation to what is perhaps the region’s main future development challenge: rising inequality. Combined together, these two issues have thus created a difficult environment for the government to formulate future directions for Australian aid programs in Asia. In this respect, it is perhaps not surprising that it opted to <b>defer</b> <b>addressing</b> these issues until a later date. It {{will not be able to}} do so indefinitely, however. With the Australian aid program scheduled to grow dramatically over the next few years and Asian engagement back on the national policy agenda, it will be important for the government to clearly indicate how the two priorities fit together.    ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how evidence from systematic review (SR) is perceived and negotiated by expert stakeholders in considering a technology for potential disinvestment. Methods: An evidence-informed stakeholder engagement examined results from a diagnostic accuracy SR of vitamin B- 12 and folate tests. Pathologists deliberated around the SR findings to generate an informed contribution to future policy for the funding of B- 12 and folate tests. Deliberations were transcribed and subject to qualitative analysis. Results: Pathologists did not engage with findings from the SR in depth; rather they sought to contest the terms of the problem driving the review and attempted to reframe it. Pathologists questioned the usefulness of SR outcomes given the variable definitions of B- 12 deficiency and <b>deferred</b> <b>addressing</b> disinvestment options specifically pertaining to B- 12 testing. However, folate testing was proffered as a potential disinvestment candidate, based upon pathologists' definition of 'appropriate' evidence beyond the bounds of the SR. Conclusions: The value of SR to informing disinvestment deliberations by expert stakeholders may be a function of timing as well as content. Engagement of stakeholders in co-produced evidence may be required at two levels: (i) Early in the synthesis phase to help shape the SR and harmonize expert views with the available evidence (including gaps); (ii) Collaboration in primary research to fill evidence-gaps thus supporting evidence-based disinvestment. Without this, information asymmetry between clinically engaged experts and decision makers may preclude the collaborative, informed, and technical discussions required to generate productive policy change...|$|R

Track III: Energy InfrastructureUniversity of Central Missouri (UCM) solicited {{proposals for}} a performance-based energy savings program that furthers Central's transformation to a nationally recognized, comprehensive institution delivering a world-class university education. The program guarantees energy and operating cost savings as allowed by RSMO 8. 231 & 640. 651.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] This paper {{analyzes}} the dialogue process in the Sino-Tibetan dispute, examining the relationship between Beijing and the Dalai Lama from their initial engagement in the early post-Mao years through the protracted stalemate of the 1990 s {{and on to the}} current experimentation with direct contacts. In addition to drawing on lessons from the past, the study surveys the major factors that are likely to impact the future dynamics of engagement. It thereby provides an assessment of the current prospects for dialogue and for settling the longstanding dispute. The authors question the view that important opportunities for negotiations were missed in the 1980 s. Rather, they argue that even when Beijing appeared most inclined to enter into dialogue, the gap between the parties was too wide for meaningful engagement. Thus, for example, Deng Xiaoping's historic gesture toward reconciliation in 1979 was {{made on the basis of}} strategic miscalculations of the political stakes. The PRC had assumed its position in Tibet to be secure, but the exiles' fact-finding missions exposed the nationalist sentiment among Tibetans in the region, causing Beijing to reassess its strategy toward both Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The formal talks of the early 1980 s thus proved fruitless, and by 1984 the door to dialogue was no longer open. In September 1988, Beijing's interest in direct talks was rekindled following the Dalai Lama's success in raising the profile of Tibet in international forums. The Chinese openness to dialogue was indeed greater than it had been during the talks of 1984. However, internal Chinese politics undermined this initiative. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen crackdown, those in Beijing who had been promoting talks were shut out of power. A bitter standoff between the parties prevailed through most of the 1990 s, fueled both by Beijing's hard-line policy on Tibet and by the exiled Tibetan leadership's uneven commitment to engagement. But as Beijing regained its political confidence and as Sino-US relations moved to the center of China's foreign policy, some in the Chinese political elite began to reconsider the strategy of isolating the Dalai Lama from the Tibet policy. In early 1997, direct channels between Dharamsala and the Chinese leadership were quietly re-established. After three rounds of informal meetings, Jiang Zemin publicly acknowledged in 1998 that contacts with the Dalai Lama were underway. However, within weeks of the announcement the channels of communication broke down. Jiang's exploratory initiative was derailed by institutional resistance to talks and by political rivalry within the Chinese leadership. Chinese openness to dialogue soon regained momentum, and, in 2001, in the wake of the highly visible departures of Arjia Rinpoche and the young Karmapa—both key figures in the PRC's Tibetan elite—the official policy of excluding the Dalai Lama was formally overturned at the Fourth Work Forum on Tibet. Since then, the parties have again been experimenting with talks. Within months of this decision, direct contacts between the parties had been re-established, and delegations of Tibetan exiles have been invited to visit China. The experimentation remains tentative, however. While the exiled Tibetan leadership has been cautiously optimistic about the significance of their recent visits, Beijing has been sending mixed signals. For instance, though Beijing demonstrated uncharacteristic flexibility on the membership of the Tibetan delegations, it has declined to acknowledge publicly that discussions are even taking place. In light of this public ambivalence, how should the PRC's shifting stance on Sino-Tibetan engagement be understood? Several factors favor increased engagement. Pressure to renew contacts with the Dalai Lama has come not only externally from international sources, but also internally from domestic critics. The willingness of Chinese scholars and strategic analysts, in particular, to criticize the prevailing hard-line policies suggests that the move toward talks is motivated not just by short-run political goals but also by a reasoned and sober consideration of China's long-term interests. As well, there are growing concerns about the longer-term effects of the accelerated economic development program. Not only has economic development come at an extraordinarily high cost, but, contrary to expectations, the rapid economic expansion in Tibet appears to be creating a heightened sense of ethnic cleavage and dispossession among the Tibetans. Other developments have more complex implications for the dialogue process. China's changing global position, shifts in the regional strategic balance, and the changing role of religion are among the complicating factors. One of the most striking developments has been the institutional restructuring of Beijing's decision-making process for managing the Tibet issue. China has created an elite "leading small group" on Tibet, drastically expanded the Tibetan units in the United Front (the Party organ charged with establishing alliances with non-Party interest groups), and overhauled the key personnel dealing with Tibetan policy and administration. These developments have made Beijing's institutional management of Tibetan affairs more complex and considerably less predictable. In many ways, prospects for Sino-Tibetan engagement are better now than they have ever been. Greater access to information, increased professionalization, and two decades of experience with hit-and-miss talks have prepared both parties for the development of more informed and serious relations. Nevertheless, prospects for a negotiated solution are still limited, as it is unlikely that the two sides can overcome their differences on the substantive issues. The Dalai Lama's Strasbourg proposal of 1988 conceded Tibet's right to independence by calling for the "genuine autonomy" of a unified Tibet within the framework of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It seems improbable that the Tibetan exiled leaders would be willing to make further concessions. As for Beijing, current political realities militate against acceding to Dharamasala's demands for meaningful autonomy. Unless the Tibet issue should erupt as a violent conflict, the factors pushing Beijing to negotiate are likely to be regarded as insufficiently compelling to justify the risks entailed. On the other hand, if the current talks break off, Beijing will be going it alone as it manages the chronic threat of ethnonationalist discontent. Thus the new round of talks involves complex issues for both sides. As the Chinese leadership <b>defers</b> <b>addressing</b> its problem of legitimacy in Tibet indefinitely into the future, the push for greater autonomy and local rule is likely to intensify on the plateau. This, no doubt, is being contemplated in Beijing, as the window of opportunity to negotiate a lasting solution draws to a close. Under the present unpromising circumstances, the challenge for the exiled Tibetan leadership will be to determine whether it makes sense for Tibetans to bargain seriously with Beijing instead of preparing for a better day to strike a deal. For the time being, the two sides are most likely to continue simply talking about talks. The current dialogue process provides Beijing a risk management strategy for the region, while presenting exiled Tibetan leaders a new opportunity to play a role in the deliberations over issues facing contemporary Tibet. Whether the opportunity will also be used to push for the creation of conditions more conducive to substantive negotiations remains to be seen...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{energy service}} company (ESCO) {{industry}} {{is an example of}} a private sector business model where energy savings are delivered to customers primarily through the use of performance-based contracts. This study was conceived as a snapshot of the ESCO industry prior to the economic slowdown and the introduction of federal stimulus funding mandated by enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This study utilizes two parallel analytic approaches to characterize ESCO industry and market trends in the U. S. : (1) a ?top-down? approach involving a survey of individual ESCOs to estimate aggregate industry activity and (2) a ?bottom-up? analysis of a database of ~;; 3, 250 projects (representing over $ 8 B in project investment) that reports market trends including installed EE retrofit strategies, project installation costs and savings, project payback times, and benefit-cost ratios over time. Despite the onset of a severe economic recession, the U. S. ESCO industry managed to grow at about 7 percent per year between 2006 and 2008. ESCO industry revenues were about $ 4. 1 billion in 2008 and ESCOs anticipate accelerated growth through 2011 (25 percent per year). We found that 2, 484 ESCO projects in our database generated ~;;$ 4. 0 billion ($ 2009) in net, direct economic benefits to their customers. We estimate that the ESCO project database includes about 20 percent of all U. S. ESCO market activity from 1990 - 2008. Assuming the net benefits per project are comparable for ESCO projects that are not included in the LBNL database, this would suggest that the ESCO industry has generated ~;;$ 23 billion in net direct economic benefits for customers at projects installed between 1990 and 2008. There is empirical evidence confirming that the industry is evolving by installing more comprehensive and complex measures?including onsite generation and measures to <b>address</b> <b>deferred</b> maintenance?but this evolution has significant implications for customer project economics, especially at K- 12 schools. We found that the median simple payback time has increased from 1. 9 to 3. 2 years in private sector projects since the early-to-mid 1990 s and from 5. 2 to 10. 5 years in public sector projects for the same time period...|$|R
40|$|Aims Challenges {{in seeking}} parents’ consent for {{research}} at the point when their child is critically ill have been a significant barrier to improving treatments for children and conducting trials. In 2008 UK legislation was amended to enable consent for emergency research to be sought after a child has been given the investigational drug or device. This is known as deferred consent. CONNECT is the first UK study to explore parent and practitioner views and experiences of deferred consent in children’s clinical care trials. It aimed to integrate evidence and ethical theory to inform practice guidelines to optimise recruitment and consent in this challenging setting. Methods Mixed methods qualitative and quantitative study with 354 participants (292 parents, 39 nurses, 19 doctors and 4 Clinical Trials Unit practitioners). We integrated findings with previous research and ethical theory to develop draft guidance on deferred consent. The CONNECT advisory group and 32 key stakeholders (critical care practitioners, ethicists and parents) contributed {{to the development of}} the final CONNECT guidance. Results Parents may be initially shocked or angered to discover their child can be entered into a trial without their prior consent. However practitioner explanations of why consent is <b>deferred</b> can help <b>address</b> parents’ initial concerns and reassure them. Parents view deferred consent as more acceptable for trials of medical interventions already used in clinical practice than trials involving new interventions or a change in clinical practice. Practitioners experienced in deferred consent describe how families are receptive to the consent method, if conducted sensitively and if the timing is appropriate. CONNECT guidance provides recommendations to inform: 1) pre-trial research for potentially challenging trials; 2) publicising trials that use deferred consent; 3) seeking deferred consent; 4) seeking deferred consent when a child has died; 5) written trial information; and 6) child assent. Conclusion Those involved in the funding, design, conduct and ethical review of critical care trials can use CONNECT guidance to help ensure approaches to deferred consent are appropriateto the needs of children and their parents. Further research is required to explore the views of children and bereaved parents who have experienced deferred consent...|$|R
40|$|In this {{information}} explosion era, data volumes grow drastically, posing great {{challenge to the}} data-intensive applications, such as the database management systems. These data-intensive applications are required to process the huge amount of data quickly. However, in the current hard disk-based storage system, the speed gap between the CPU and hard disks becomes the bottleneck to improve the performance. At this time, the Solid State Disk (SSD) is on the spotlight. The SSD, mainly composed of flash memory, has a significant performance advantage over the traditional hard disk. The read performance of SSD is about two orders of magnitude better than that of hard disk. The sequential write performance of SSD is also much better than that of hard disk. However, the random write performance of SSD is comparable or even worse than that of hard disk, because of the "erase-before-write" design of the flash SSD. Therefore, comprehensive study is required to incorporate the flash SSDs into the existing enterprise database management systems. In this dissertation, I performed a research {{on the possibility of}} building high performance database management systems with SSDs. Firstly I provided the basic performance study of the flash SSD. I built a micro benchmark to bypass the operating system buffer cache to get the real performance of flash SSD. With the micro benchmark, I got the performance results of flash SSD. I implemented a flash SSD measurement and simulation system. Secondly I had the performance evaluation of database system with TPC-C benchmark. The IO behavior in the TPC-C experimental system was analyzed along the IO path. Next, I described the SSD-oriented scheduling methods, confirmed the potential performance improvement by static ordering and merging IO trace, and verified the expected performance gain through online IO replaying. The evaluation of this scheduling system showed that it can significantly improve the IO performance of database system on flash SSDs. I summarized the findings, and drew a conclusion that the write <b>defering</b> and coalescing, <b>address</b> converting and aligning was very effective with little resource in the scheduling system. Therefore, the proposed SSD-oriented scheduling was effective to improve the database performance.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The future of intercity passenger rail service in the United States {{has come to a}} critical juncture. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) continues to rely heavily on federal subsidies [...] over $ 1 billion annually in recent years [...] and operating losses have remained high. In addition, Amtrak will require billions of dollars to <b>address</b> <b>deferred</b> maintenance and achieve a "state of good repair. " These needs for Amtrak come {{at a time when the}} nation faces long-term fiscal challenges. As we reported in February 2005, the federal government's financial condition and long-term fiscal outlook present enormous challenges to the nation's ability to respond to emerging forces reshaping American society, the United States' place in the world, and the future role of the federal government. Addressing the projected fiscal gaps will require policy makers to examine the affordability and sustainability of all existing programs, policies, functions, and activities throughout the federal budget. Reexamining the federal role and expenditures on intercity passenger rail service will be particularly difficult because opinions differ about what this service should be. Some advocate a greatly expanded federal role and the expansion of intercity passenger rail to relieve growing congestion on highways and airways and (as energy prices increase) to provide more fuel-efficient transport; others believe the federal role should be scaled back, and that at least some federal operating subsidies should be eliminated. Specific proposals vary [...] while one proposal would keep Amtrak largely intact and provide more funding for capital and other improvements, another proposal would significantly restructure the management and accountability for intercity passenger rail with regional, state, and local entities making fundamental decisions about what intercity passenger rail services are justified and will receive public financial support. Amtrak itself has proposed a new vision for intercity passenger rail service that would include a greater role for states in planning and developing passenger rail corridors. The former acting president of Amtrak told us that, in his view, Amtrak itself is not a substitute for a national intercity passenger rail policy and that Congress needs to develop such a policy. One of the primary difficulties in reexamining the federal role and expenditures on intercity passenger rail service and developing a clear national intercity passenger rail policy will be reconciling the wide diversity of views about what this service should be and what it should achieve. On November 13, 2006, we issued our most recent report on intercity passenger rail. The objectives of this report were to determine: (1) the characteristics of the current U. S. intercity passenger rail system and the potential benefits obtained from this system, (2) foreign experiences with passenger rail reform and observations for the United States, (3) how well the United States is positioned for reforming its intercity passenger rail system, (4) challenges the United States faces in overcoming obstacles to reform, and (5) potential options for the future of intercity passenger rail service. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} a study {{is carried out}} with the aim to {{identify}} added values of EPC projects implemented in schools {{in order to increase}} the interest of EPC projects on the market. The report examines how the planned maintenance, supervision, maintenance and corrective maintenance is affected, how insurance premiums and terms are affected, the indoor environment and how the tasks of the operating staff is changing. A literature study of energy savings, energy use in schools, maintenance and insurance as well as how energy efficiency improvements are related to the Swedish environmental objectives has been made. Visits were carried out in Ludvika, interviews were also carried out with operation technicians and local strategists in Ludvika as well as employees of insurance companies. Schools often have neglected maintenance and problems with ventilation and indoor environment. Schools also have a large energy saving potential due to their low utilization, mainly because they are empty parts of the year. All Swedish schools could reduce their electricity consumption by 1 TWh per year, which in money equivalents to the salary costs of about 2, 000 teaching positions. 8 schools in Ludvika and 10 schools in Piteå who has completed EPC projects have been studied. The time periods studied are seven years for Ludvika, 2006 – 2012, and for Piteå five years, 2010 – 2014. The data of fault reports and maintenance costs are taken from the municipalities, and descriptions of schools and EPC projects have been received from Caverion who has carried out the EPC projects. Data for maintenance has to some extent been selected in consultation with employees at the municipalities. The number of error reports in Piteå schools have shown a slight downward trend with a peak while the EPC project was carried out and one year after. Ludvika has shown an upward trend in maintenance costs, but this is probably due to previously accumulated maintenance. The amount of corrective maintenance is reduced, but only after the project when newly found errors have been fixed and the systems have been properly adjusted. The tasks related to supervisory and maintenance has changed when remote control of systems was installed which leads to a better overview and simplifies troubleshooting. The indoor temperature got more stable, but only after they fixed the weaknesses revealed in connection with the operational optimization. However, there are complaints in Ludvika of low temperatures, but it is caused the target temperature being set too low by the municipality. Insurance is only marginally affected, and only when damage prevention measures are implemented in the properties, which is not done in the studied properties. However, the underlying data sets are too small and over a too small time period to prove any certain changes. An added value identified is the ability to use EPC projects as a tool to <b>address</b> <b>deferred</b> maintenance in the real estate portfolio outside the normal budgetary framework while achieving energy savings.  I denna rapport genomförs en studie med mål att identifiera mervärden i EPC-projekt genomförda i skolor för att öka intresset för EPC-projekt på marknaden.
