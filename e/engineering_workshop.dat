5|$|In 1931, McAloney {{purchased}} a garage and <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> in Wirrulla. He operated the establishment {{for the next}} five years, the business conducting work on various types of vehicle including cars, trucks and tractors. However, the business ultimately experienced financial difficulties and was forced to close. In a ceremony on 24 June 1935, McAloney wed Dora Winifred Johnson. The couple had seven children: sons William (Bill), John and Paul; and daughters Glenice, Rae, Anne and Judith.|$|E
5|$|The Institution {{is split}} into six {{administrative}} divisions: East (East Anglia and South East England), South (South West England), West (Wales and the Isle of Man), North (East and west coasts of northern England), Scotland and Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). The {{headquarters of the}} RNLI are in Poole, Dorset, adjacent to Holes Bay in Poole Harbour. It includes RNLI HQ, lifeboat maintenance and repair facilities, the Lifeboat Support Centre and RNLI College (the training centre). The support centre and college were opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. Specialist training facilities include a wave and capsize pool, a fire simulator, a ship's bridge simulator and an <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop.</b> The College's accommodation is available for RNLI members and their guests when training is not taking place and offers facilities for weddings, conferences and other events. About half of the RNLI's staff work at Poole. Other locations are Dublin, London, Perth, Saltash, St Asaph and Stockton-on-Tees, while some roles are at lifeboat stations or home-based and include operations, estate and financial management, public relations and information technology. A new headquarters for RNLI Ireland was opened at Airside in Swords, County Dublin in June 2006 by President Mary McAleese, attended by the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the RNLI, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, R.N.|$|E

25|$|By {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century Brighton works could no longer cope with the repair and {{building}} of both locomotives and rolling stock. In 1911 the LB built a carriage and wagon works at Lancing, which operated until 1965. A marine <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> was established in the mid 1870s at Newhaven.|$|E
25|$|After his {{relatives}} published an announcement in the Stuttgarter Anzeiger newspaper, a philanthropic institution at Reutlingen took in Maybach as a student. Its founder and director, , discovered Maybach's technical inclination {{and helped to}} stimulate his career by sending him to the school's <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop.</b> At 15 years old (1861), Maybach was heading {{for a career in}} Industrial design and took extra classes in physics and mathematics at Reutlingen's public high school.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} {{was bought by}} the United Steel Companies Limited (USC) on 29 June 1945. USC needed replacement locomotives so {{it made sense to}} buy a manufacturer (at the right price) and the idea had been put forward of developing a central <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> for their steelworks at Templeborough (Rotherham) and Stocksbridge. Both works were being expanded and redeveloped, and were easily accessible by rail from the YEC works. In the post war climate, the YEC management were willing to sell.|$|E

25|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} Vandyke Road {{the line}} curves 90 degrees to Vandyke Junction {{where there was}} a passing loop. Here the branch line from Chamberlain's Barn and New Trees quarries joined the main line. A short section of this branch remains intact although heritage trains do not use it. The railway then runs parallel to Vandyke Road, climbing steadily to Bryan's Loop then descending again to cross the Shenley Hill Road. The line levels and continues to Stonehenge Works now the <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> of the preserved railway. This is also the northern terminus of modern operations.|$|E
25|$|Brabham was a Royal Australian Air Force flight {{mechanic}} {{and ran a}} small <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> before he started racing midget cars in 1948. His successes with midgets in Australian and New Zealand road racing events led to his going to Britain to further his racing career. There he {{became part of the}} Cooper Car Company's racing team, building as well as racing cars. He contributed to the design of the mid-engined cars that Cooper introduced to Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and won the Formula One world championship in 1959 and 1960. In 1962 he established his own Brabham marque with fellow Australian Ron Tauranac, which in the 1960s became the largest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world. In the 1966 Formula One season Brabham became the first – and still the only – man to win the Formula One world championship driving one of his own cars. He was the last surviving World Champion of the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|In 1973 the all of {{the rails}} towards Richmond Main beyond {{the site of the}} former Stockrington No.1 Colliery were lifted for use at other Coal & Allied (as J & A Brown etc., had now become) operations. In October 1973 the line serving the <b>engineering</b> <b>workshops</b> at Hexham was closed and the right angled {{crossing}} across the Government Railway mainline was removed. The <b>engineering</b> <b>workshops</b> remained open constructing and overhauling equipment for the underground coal mining industry.|$|R

2500|$|In 1939-1949 Tolnai was an {{employee}} of [...] (AB Gerhard Arehn <b>Engineering</b> <b>Workshop)</b> on Alströmergatan 15 and 17 in Kungsholmen in Stockholm, later , as inventor and constructor, and there Gábor Kornél Tolnai built the Swedish army's new central instrument for anti-aircraft cannons ("Rapportoskop"). He invented a key instrument for anti-aircraft cannons (Arenco). Arenco AB is a Swedish industrial company that produces, among other things, packaging machines. Arenco was incorporated in Svenska Tändsticks AB (STAB) in 1917 with a diversified product range covering, apart from match machinery, also packaging and fish processing machines. The quality of the products has always been considered to be in top position. Diploma engineer Ernst von Segebaden was an engineer in Arenco AB from 1912, {{and then he was}} the director of Arenco in 1949-1955.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, the 31 {{cars were}} {{purchased}} by the British luxury travel company, Orient Express Trains & Cruises (of Orient-Express Hotels) and taken to A & G Price, of Thames, for regauging from New Zealand's [...] gauge to [...] gauge for Thai and Malaysian railway lines. 24 cars (19 sleepers, three buffet cars and two power vans) went to Singapore where an extensive internal rebuild and fit-out as well as exterior painting and badging on was undertaken by the new owners at their (then) newly constructed maintenance depot on KTMB land in Singapore's Keppel Road rail yards. A 25th car also went to Singapore, and was stored unrefurbished for some years, but was scrapped when the E moved its <b>engineering</b> <b>workshop</b> from Singapore to Johor. Since then the refurbished consist has, along with non-Silver Star stock, operated a regular 5-star luxury cruise-train service between Singapore and Bangkok as the Eastern & Oriental Express.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1890s the {{shipyard}} was heavily {{engaged in the}} construction of warships for the Royal Navy and also for export. The Royal Navy's first submarine, Holland 1, was built in 1901, and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of airships and airship hangars during the early 20th century. Originally constructed in a large shed at Cavendish Dock, production later relocated to Barrow/Walney Island Airport. HMA No. 1, nicknamed the Mayfly is the most notable airship to have been built in Barrow. The first {{of its kind in the}} UK it came to an untimely end on 24 September 1911 when it was wrecked by wind during trials. Well-known ships built in Barrow include , the Japanese flagship during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, the liner [...] and the aircraft carriers [...] and [...] It should also be noted that there was a significant presence of Vickers' armament division in Barrow with the huge Heavy <b>Engineering</b> <b>Workshop</b> on Michaelson Road supplying ammunition for the British Army and Royal Navy throughout both world wars. World War 1 brought significant temporary migration as workers arrived to work in the munitions factory and shipyard, with the town's population reaching to an estimated peak of around 82,000 during the War. Thousands of local men fought abroad during World War I, 616 were ultimately killed in action.|$|E
