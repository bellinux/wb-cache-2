5|$|With the United States {{represented}} by Fisher, the first Special Session on <b>Disarmament</b> of the United Nations General Assembly {{was held in}} 1978 {{and led to the}} established in 1979 of the U.N. Conference on <b>Disarmament</b> as the single multilateral <b>disarmament</b> negotiating forum of the international community.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical which would later allegedly {{be used in}} poison-gas attacks inside Syria in 2014, {{is not on the}} list of prohibited chemicals covered by the <b>disarmament</b> agreement.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, Fisher {{served as}} the Deputy Director of the U.S. Arms Control and <b>Disarmament</b> Agency in which he took a primary {{negotiations}} role during the Atomic Test Ban Treaty of 1963 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy, Adviser to the President on <b>Disarmament.</b> In 1968, Fisher served {{as one of the}} chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on July 1, 1968. A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk regarding his perception and activities on arms control and <b>disarmament</b> is maintained by the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5|$|In early 1959, a {{roadblock}} {{to an agreement}} was removed as Macmillan and Eisenhower, over opposition from the Department of Defense, agreed to consider a test ban separately from broader <b>disarmament</b> endeavors.|$|E
5|$|President Jimmy Carter {{nominated}} Fisher for {{the rank}} of Ambassador while serving as the U.S. Representative to the Conference of the Committee on <b>Disarmament</b> in 1977, where he served through 1981.|$|E
5|$|The President, Major General Joseph Kabila is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The Minister of Defence, {{formally}} Ministers of Defence, <b>Disarmament,</b> and Veterans (Ancien Combattants), {{with the}} French acronym MDNDAC, is Alexandre Luba Ntambo.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as Under Secretary of State in 1954, Smith {{continued to}} serve the Eisenhower administration in various posts. He {{was a member of}} the National Security Training Commission from 1955 to 1957, the National War College board of consultants from 1956 to 1959, the Office of Defense Mobilization Special Stockpile Advisory Committee from 1957 to 1958, the President's Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program from 1956 to 1957, and the President's Committee on <b>Disarmament</b> in 1958. Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office (<b>Disarmament)</b> in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as Chairman of the Advisory Council of the President's Committee on Fund Raising, and as a member-at-large from 1958 to 1961. In recognition of his other former boss, he {{was a member of the}} George C. Marshall Foundation Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1961.|$|E
5|$|After the war, New Zealand {{was sent}} {{on a second}} world tour, this time to allow Admiral John Jellicoe to review the naval defences of the Dominions. In 1920, the battlecruiser was placed in reserve. She was broken up for scrap in 1922 {{in order to meet}} Britain's tonnage limit in the <b>disarmament</b> {{provisions}} of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{assigned}} {{the task of}} following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the Soviet government. This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince, Kamal Khan, and his associate, Octopussy, and {{the discovery of a}} plot to force <b>disarmament</b> in Western Europe {{with the use of a}} nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, was allegedly used in poison-gas attacks by the Assad government in 2014. Chlorine {{is not on}} the list of prohibited chemicals covered by the <b>disarmament</b> agreement; however, its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention.|$|E
5|$|Descended from Irish {{nationalist}} grandparents on both sides, Neal {{has been}} an advocate for Irish concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. He is the co-chair of the ad hoc Committee on Irish Affairs, has been chairman of the Friends of Ireland since 2007, and was considered {{as a candidate for}} United States Ambassador to Ireland in 1998. After the <b>disarmament</b> of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with Sinn Féin MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the action of <b>disarmament</b> and ensure a lasting peace had been reached. Neal invited Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams to the inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009. Neal has been named {{as one of the top}} 100 Irish-Americans by Irish America magazine and received the International Leadership Award from The American Ireland Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, <b>disarmament</b> experts such as Ralf Trapp {{characterized}} {{the pace of}} the operation as impressively quick. With 92.5% of the arsenal removed or destroyed, Trapp noted that many people hadn't expected such speed to be achievable given the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|My {{heart is}} {{breaking}} with this; {{my time as}} fleet commander {{has come to an}} inglorious end. The remaining questions of demobilization, <b>disarmament,</b> and the negotiations with the soldiers councils can be handled by my chief of staff; I have nothing more to do. I shall remain pro forma in command for a short time, otherwise, I am dead tired.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear <b>Disarmament,</b> chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader <b>disarmament,</b> and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and <b>disarmament</b> treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a <b>disarmament</b> treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E
5|$|The 39-story Secretariat Building was {{completed}} in 1952. It houses offices for the Secretary General, the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Office of <b>Disarmament</b> Affairs, and the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM).|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The {{aftermath}} of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear <b>disarmament</b> and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The World <b>Disarmament</b> Conference was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, {{with representatives}} from 60 states. A one-year {{moratorium}} on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed {{at the start of}} the conference. The <b>Disarmament</b> Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies. The Kellogg–Briand Pact, facilitated by the commission in 1928, failed in its objective of outlawing war. Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s. The League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's remilitarisation of the Rhineland, occupation of the Sudetenland and Anschluss of Austria, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World <b>Disarmament</b> Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy and Spain in 1937. The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland.|$|E
5|$|This was a {{reference}} to the demonstrations of the Campaign for Nuclear <b>Disarmament</b> (the Aldermaston Marches) which took the form of marches from Aldermaston to London (apart from in 1958, when the march went from London to Aldermaston). This was an annual march from 1958 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent a}} future world war, the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed {{conflict}} through collective security, military and naval <b>disarmament,</b> and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.|$|E
5|$|While Brezhnev was plotting, Podgorny's {{position}} within the Politburo grew stronger. Podgorny {{had been able to}} win support from the hardline communists due to Brezhnev's liberal-minded policy regarding Yugoslavia, military <b>disarmament</b> deals with the First World, and forcing East Germany into a concession with West Germany in the Berlin negotiations.|$|E
5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author Harry M. Caudill, who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful. He {{was active in the}} formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education. He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and <b>Disarmament.</b>|$|E
5|$|Annex 2 {{states are}} those that {{formally}} participated in the 1996 Conference on <b>Disarmament</b> and possessed nuclear power or research reactors at the time. Annex 2 lists the following 44 States: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval <b>disarmament.</b> When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} warhead, primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking <b>disarmament,</b> {{in the belief that}} the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN <b>Disarmament</b> Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a supranational body.|$|E
5|$|However, the Treaty of Versailles {{is signed}} {{the very day}} he prepares to leave, and so he is forced to abort his mission, much to his dismay. He returns to the United States and works {{in a number of}} professions — steel mill worker, bank teller, farm hand, and <b>disarmament</b> {{lobbyist}} — but his unique stature among mortal men forever brings him grief. He eventually offers his services to a noted history professor preparing a Mayan archaeological dig and travels with the group to the Yucatan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and <b>Disarmament</b> Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to restrictions on the production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader <b>disarmament</b> effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi <b>disarmament</b> mandates, precipitating a {{diplomatic}} crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing {{the use of military}} force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E
5|$|India's Foreign Policy {{has also}} {{to some degree}} been {{influenced}} by the DPSPs. India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities. By 2004, the Indian Army had participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations. India {{played a key role in}} the passing of a UN resolution in 2003, which envisaged better co-operation between the Security Council and the troop-contributing countries. India has also been in favour of nuclear <b>disarmament.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mancera assumed {{office on}} December 5, 2012, as the sixth Mayor of Mexico City. On December 24, 2012, Mancera began a {{voluntary}} <b>disarmament</b> campaign in Iztapalapa borough, in return people who participated would receive money, tablet computers, and home appliance. As of January 8, 2013, more than 1,300 weapons were secured there, including small arms and grenades. The program {{was applied to}} all Mexico City's boroughs during 2013, 2014, and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger <b>disarmament</b> efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, Vice-admiral du Fournet, {{commander-in-chief}} of {{the allied}} Mediterrean fleet, used the sinking of two Greek merchant ships by a German submarine, {{as well as the}} secret agreement, to demand the surrender of the docked Greek war ships and took command of the Salamis naval arsenal. The Greek government yielded, and on 7 November, the partial <b>disarmament</b> of Greek warships began. The Allies towed away 30 lighter craft. Three weeks later the French took over the Salamis naval base completely, and began using Greek ships operated by French crews.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for <b>disarmament</b> and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
