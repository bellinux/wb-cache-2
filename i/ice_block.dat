5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the last <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> the crew put {{the ship in}} autopilot and went to hibernate with the passengers, leaving the ship's maintenance to robots. Except {{for a brief period}} of activity to start deceleration, the crew slept for most of the trip, awaking one year before reaching Eden. The plan was to continue deceleration while consuming the last of the ice shell, and then put the ship in orbit around the planet, delivering the passengers down by gliders that would be retrieved by hooks to be reused.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{had been}} an enormous success, both in accomplishing the goal it had set out to accomplish, and by generating worldwide press coverage for {{the company and its}} product. The venture was reported on as far away as India. In 1979, Oslo Marketing Association commemorated the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> expedition with a special event titled [...] "The world's greatest publicity stunt". To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009, Glava AS made the original documentary of the expedition available online. They also released a newly recorded interview with Sivert Klevan, who by that time was 84 years old.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{pressure}} on the grass from <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> can damage the grass and {{has resulted in the}} activity often being banned or restricted by park authorities and groundskeepers. The Slicer All-Season Sled by Ice Meister is a commercially available sled that uniquely incorporates the concept of <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> in order for it to be used on grass during the summer (as well as on snow during the winter without the <b>ice</b> <b>blocks).</b> Because the Slicer Sled utilizes lighter and thinner <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> with a large surface area, it does not damage the grass the way that traditional <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> can.|$|R

Their job was to "wing" <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> to stackers and keep the elevator clear. This conveyor was used to load <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> directly onto rail cars. Ice dealers in distant cities often took delivery immediately. Their expected loss in transit was 25 percent...|$|R
5000|$|In Fresno, California {{the sport}} has been embraced {{by high school}} students, who {{frequent}} parks during late night hours {{in an effort to}} evade law enforcement officers. <b>Ice</b> <b>blocking</b> was once a very popular night time activity at Hillcrest Park in Fullerton, California, but has subsided since its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. <b>Ice</b> <b>blocking</b> was popular in Adelaide, Australia, because there is no snow in the state. The sport has a long-standing tradition at Southern Nazarene University (Bethany, Oklahoma), where the Student Government Association holds the event annually. [...] In 2011, TLC's series Sister Wives highlighted <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> in the first episode of their second season. This episode showed the polygamist family spending an afternoon picnic <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> at a park.|$|R
500|$|The <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> {{expedition}} of 1959 (...) was {{a publicity}} stunt {{carried out by the}} Norwegian insulation material producer Glassvatt (today called Glava AS). Responding to a challenge from the radio station Radio Luxembourg, Glassvatt decided to equip a truck to bring a three-ton block of ice from Mo i Rana by the Arctic Circle, to Libreville by the Equator. There was no form of refrigeration applied, and the expedition was intended to display the efficiency of the insulating glass wool used. The truck also brought 300kg of medicines to the hospital of Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{then was}} followed by a worldwide press corps, and crowds of spectators gathered in various European cities along the route. Crossing the Sahara, where the truck repeatedly got stuck in the sand, proved both a dangerous and laborious task. Once the truck had made it through the desert, however, and reached its final destination, it was revealed that the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> had lost only about 11% of its original weight. When the expedition reached its goal it generated much media attention for the company. It was called [...] "the world's greatest publicity stunt". To mark the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009, the company made the original documentary of the expedition available online. They also released a new interview with the expedition's leader Sivert Klevan, who was 84 {{years old at the time}} of the interview.|$|E
500|$|The Johns Hopkins Glacier {{rises from}} the Fairweather Range on the east slopes of Lituya Mountain and Mount Salisbury and has a {{westerly}} [...] flow towards the head of Johns Hopkins Inlet, 1 mile (1.6km) southwest of the terminus of Clark Glacier and 79 miles (127km) northwest of Hoonah. Its rock, ice and snow depict a variety of impressive colors such as grey, blue and white. It was named in 1893 by H.F. Reid after the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which sponsored an expedition to this glacier. It is the only advancing tidewater glacier now (its advance started in 1924 when Grand Pacific Glacier started receding towards Tarr Inlet) and is combined with Gilman Glacier (first got attached to Hopkins in the 1990s, broke off and rejoined several times and once again it appears joined since 2000); both are advancing as one single <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> and at the waterfront, has a width of [...] with a depth of , rises to a height of [...] and stretches to about [...] upstream. Submarine calving has also been recorded.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blocking</b> is a {{recreational}} {{activity in which}} individuals {{race to the bottom}} of a hill sitting on large <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice.</b> In the United States <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> is thought to be regional, occurring in the West. The only equipment needed is some large <b>blocks</b> of thick <b>ice</b> and clothing, preferably padded. Hessian sacks or old towels have been recommended to sit on. Enthusiasts have been known to make [...] "customized" [...] <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> by freezing ropes into them to act as handles, and mixing colouring agents into the water prior to freezing.|$|R
5000|$|Interplanetary {{space is}} filled with traces of {{hydrogen}} gas, which cause the planets to slowly spiral inwards, along with <b>ice</b> <b>blocks.</b> The outer planets are large mainly because they have swallowed {{a large number of}} <b>ice</b> <b>blocks,</b> but the inner planets have not swallowed nearly as many. One can see <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> on the move in the form of meteors, and when one collides with the Earth, it produces hailstorms over an area of many square kilometers, while when one falls into the Sun, it produces a sunspot and gets vaporized, making [...] "fine ice," [...] that covers the innermost planets.|$|R
2500|$|The Police {{made their}} first {{television}} appearance {{a few months}} later, in October 1978, on BBC2's The Old Grey Whistle Test to promote the release of Outlandos d'Amour. Though [...] "Roxanne" [...] was never banned (despite A's claims to the contrary) the BBC did ban the second single from Outlandos d'Amour, [...] "Can't Stand Losing You". This {{was due to the}} single's cover, which featured Copeland hanging himself over an <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> being melted by a portable radiator. The single became a minor chart hit, the Police's first, peaking at No. 42 in the UK. The follow-up single [...] "So Lonely", issued in November 1978, failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|Advancing {{from its}} British and Australian English origins, New Zealand English has {{developed}} to include many Americanisms and American vocabulary in preference over British terms {{as well as}} directly borrowed American vocabulary. Some examples of American words used instead of British words in New Zealand English are bobby pin for British hair pin, muffler for the British silencer, truck for the British lorry, station wagon for the British estate car, stove over cooker, creek over brook, hope chest over bottom drawer, eggplant instead of aubergine, hardware store instead of ironmonger, median strip for central reservation, stroller for pushchair, pushup for press-up, potato chip instead of potato crisp, licence plate for registration plate, cellphone or cell for British and Australian mobile phone and mobile, and <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> instead of British ice lolly (or Australian icy pole.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Born in Lubbock, Texas, Fred J. Dukes {{starts out}} {{as a member of}} a circus sideshow under the name [...] "The Blob". He is {{detected}} and contacted by Charles Xavier via Cyclops, who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> round his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the mansion, as he plans to get the X-Men's technology and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device so he can erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts Marvel Girl and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer's tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.|$|E

50|$|As glaciers {{advanced}} and retreated through Minnesota, {{some of the}} ice that stagnated was more difficult to melt than other areas. The glaciers continued to deposit sediments around and sometimes on top of these isolated <b>ice</b> <b>blocks.</b> As the <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> melted, they left behind depressions in the landscape. The depressions filled with snowmelt and rainwater producing kettle lakes.|$|R
50|$|The first ice-resurfacer was {{the brainchild}} of Frank J. Zamboni, who was {{originally}} in the refrigeration business. He provided services to businesses such as dairy farms and produce vendors. Zamboni created a plant for making <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> {{that could be used in}} refrigeration techniques. As the demand for <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> waned, Zamboni looked for another way to capitalize on his expertise with ice.|$|R

I sat down by a great <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> about fifty feet long, to {{interrogate}} it, and see what I could make of it, by a cool, confidential proximity and examination. The ice was porous and spongy, as I have seen it on the shores of the Connecticut, when beginning to thaw out under the influence of a spring sun. I could see the little drops of water percolating in a thousand tiny streams through it, and dropping down on every side. Putting my ear to it, I could hear a fine musical trill and trickle, and that still small click and stir, as of melting ice, which showed that it was surely and gradually giving way, and flowing back again.|$|E

50|$|In this game, players control Dana. The goal of {{each stage}} {{is to put}} out all the fires. The fires are {{extinguished}} by either kicking an <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb {{on top of a}} solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push blocks of ice, which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy blocks of ice. As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> it will freeze to the adjacent surface.|$|E
