5|$|The {{character}} Eliza {{was inspired}} by an account given at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, {{a professor at the}} school. According to Rankin, in February 1838 a young slave woman, Eliza Harris, had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley with her child in <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> stayed at his house on her way further north.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white baby in <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
60|$|I took <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> drew <b>her</b> away. She linked <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> in mine <b>and</b> {{leaned on}} me.|$|R
60|$|She {{slightly}} {{showed me}} <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> it was fearfully thin indeed.|$|R

5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.|$|E
5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> waist strapped down for safety.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, a {{judge of}} first {{instance}} prohibited a poster that advertised the film Ave Maria by Jacques Richard. The poster showed a young woman, covered {{only at the}} waist, with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> feet tied to a cross. No appeal was made.|$|E
25|$|Mata Hari {{brought a}} {{carefree}} provocative style {{to the stage}} in her act, which garnered wide acclaim. The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> head. She was seldom seen without a bra as she was self-conscious about being small-breasted. She wore a bodystocking for her performances that was similar in color to her own skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs {{close to the}} vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part {{of the mass of}} her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.|$|E

25|$|In March 1934, Manon and {{her mother}} {{traveled}} to Venice for the Easter holiday. There, Manon contracted polio, which left her totally paralyzed. She returned to Vienna, where she recovered some use of <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> hands. Still determined to act, teachers from the famous Reinhardt-Seminar made house calls. Alma also encouraged visitors, including a younger Austrofascist, a bureaucrat named Erich Cyhlar, to court Manon {{in the hopes that}} pending nuptials would compel her to walk again.|$|E
25|$|Vidal finds Ofelia {{talking to}} someone (the faun) whom Vidal cannot see. Vidal takes the baby from <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is {{surrounded}} by the rebels who have taken over the outpost. Knowing {{that he will be}} killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that the child will never know so much as his name. Her brother Pedro kills Vidal.|$|E
25|$|When Prince Demitri {{was about}} two years old the Empress Catherine the Great visited The Hague, and {{as a sign of}} special favor to his father, cradled the child in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> {{appointed}} the boy an officer of the guard. He was raised as a nominal member of the Russian Orthodox Church, although his father, like many Russian aristocrats of his age, had little connection to or fondness for religion. As was fashionable at the time, the language of the household was French, which was Prince Dmitri's native tongue.|$|E
60|$|He dropped <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> walked half-way {{across the}} room. Then {{he turned and}} faced her.|$|R

25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was to say he was in his workshop, while Andersen was to say he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E

25|$|The {{facade of}} the cloister has two levels and is fronted by an arched porch area, called a portería. Above the portería, there are two windows, {{and the remains of}} the pilasters of an arch that {{corresponds}} to the open chapel, which was like a balcony. However, this balcony area was eventually walled in to make more interior space. The portería contains two arches and a frieze adorned with round forms which protrude. The portería contains the main entrance to the cloister area, above which is a crucifix set on top of a skull, which represents Calvary. The foyer of this entrance used to serve as a baptistery in the late 19th and early 20th century. The paintings here are from that era. They depict stories about the Virgin Mary who is shown with the infant Jesus in <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> symbols of the Trinity around them.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of}} her head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

She fractured her radius, two metacarpals and two fingers in <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand.
