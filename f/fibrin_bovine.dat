Chick chorioallantoic membrane assays revealed that the scaffold composition similarly influences the angiogenic potential of AdMSCs in vivo. The wound healing potential of scaffolds increases by means of a synergistic relationship between AdMSCs and biomaterial resulting in the release of proangiogenic and cytokine factors, which is currently lacking when a scaffold alone is utilized.

40|$|When fibers of fibrin clots or {{fragments}} of fibrinogen pellets are negatively stained they exhibit in the electron microscope characteristic patterns of cross-striations or bands. Those found in pellet material are indistinguishable from those seen in thrombin-induced fibrin fibers. The pattern seen in <b>fibrin</b> from <b>bovine</b> sources contains three equally spaced faint bands between every {{two of the}} broad prominent ones, spaced 23 nm apart. Human material shows a different pattern, one wherein no central faint band is seen, whereas the two remaining ones are broader. Its character is unaffected by crosslinking following fiber formation and preceding negative staining. The bovine pattern, however, is converted by such crosslinking to one that closely resembles the human. It is suggested that the striation pattern in human fibrin is due to juxtapositions of E domains of the parallel-aligned fibrin monomers with tightly coiled COOH-terminal regions of beta and gamma polypeptide chains, with no discernible contribution to the pattern from the alpha chain. In negatively stained untreated fibers of <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin,</b> however, it is proposed that the COOH-terminal region of the alpha chain becomes tightly coiled, thereby contributing the faint central striation to the band pattern.

40|$|Background—In {{heart valve}} tissue engineering, the {{optimization}} of tissue properties {{has to be}} combined with the realization of a completely autologous tissue engineering approach to obtain a functional and living heart valve replacement. Autologous conditions already have been improved by using human cell sources. However, culture conditions and scaffolds {{still have to be}} optimized. This study is based on the successful use of the scaffold system of PGA/P 4 HB combined with <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin</b> as a cell carrier. However, to create a fully autolo-gous approach the use of animal-derived fibrin has to be avoided and transferred to human fibrin. Methods and Results—Human fibrin characteristics which are important for tissue engi-neering applications such as gelation time and cell distribution, were optimized by varying thrombin and fibrinogen concentration in a fibrin disk model system. Thrombin concentration was shown to influence gelation time, and thrombin and fibrinogen concentration both influ-enced cell density and distribution. The optimized human fibrin gels were further tested by analyzing their suitability as a cell carrier in a well-known tissue engineering system. Human fibrin seeded constructs showed similar quantitative and qualitative tissue formation and me-chanical properties as <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin</b> seeded constructs. Finally, human fibrin was successfully used as a cell carrier to tissue engineer a trileaflet heart valve. Conclusion—This study demonstrated the feasibility of human fibrin as a cell carrier in com-bination with a PGA/P 4 HB scaffold for heart valve tissue engineering, bringing a completely autologous tissue engineering approach one step closer to reality. ...|$|R

BthMP {{is comprised of}} high proteolytic activity on casein, <b>fibrin</b> and <b>bovine</b> fibrinogen, with no coagulating, esterase or phospholipase A(2) activities; it was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA and 1, 10 -phenanthroline and maintained its activity on pH from 7. 0 to 9. 0 and temperature from 5 - 40 degrees C. Assays with metal ions showed that Ca(2 +) is an activator, whereas Zn(2 +) and Hg(2 +) inhibited about 50 and 80 % of its activity, respectively. The edema evidenced {{the important role of}} the toxin in the inflammatory activity of the venom. BthMP also caused unclotting, and provoked histological alterations in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice inducing hemorrhage, necrosis and leukocytic infiltrate.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether it would also influence the ability of polymerizing fibrin to activate platelets. Human fibrinogen, with or without the presence of dextran, was incubated with either human thrombin or reptilase at 37 C. Macroscopically evident fibrils first appeared at 7 1 / 2 to 8 minutes in fibrinogen solution not containing dextran and at 2 1 / 2 to 3 minutes in solution containing dextran. Both solutions caused aggregation of washed human platelets, but the one containing dextran was less potent (P less than 0. 005). Similarly, polymerizing fibrin, under the influence of dextran, was a less potent stimulator of platelet release of labeled serotonin. Scanning electron microscopy showed decreased platelet adhesion to fibrin polymerized in the presence of dextran.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{we report}} our initial {{results of a}} {{prospective}} study of duplex ultrasound-guided injection (UGTI) of thrombin {{in the management of}} femoral artery pseudo-aneurysms. We used human thrombin to avoid the increase in the human antibodies directed against fibrinogen, with the use of bovine thrombus, that preclude further utilisation of the <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin</b> glue during cardio-thoracic surgery. Methods: from 1999 to 2001, 19 patients, aged 69 (range 52 – 85) years presented with 21 femoral pseudo-aneurysms were treated. The mean pseudoaneurysm diameter was 30 (15 – 55) mm. All but two were secondary to cardiac procedures and the common femoral artery was the injured vessel in all instances. Patients were referred within 2 – 21 days following their iatrogenic injury. Results: immediate thrombosis of the sac occurred in 19 (90 %) of the 21 pseudo-aneurysms. After a second injection, complete occlusion occurred in the remaining two patients. Two patients (CI 95 %; 1 – 19) with three femoral pseudo-aneurysms developed leg pain. Duplex ultrasound follow-up showed two recurrences (9. 5 % – CI 95 %; 1 – 19) and both were treated by repeat UGTI. There was no conversion to surgical repair.

30|$|Use of {{fibrin sealant}} would be {{advantageous}} for patients {{if it could}} be obtained easily. Because fibrin sealant biodegrades within 2  weeks, foreign bodies, such as sutures and staples, are not left in the wound, especially in the granulation bed. In addition, patients often report severe pain when staples are removed, and occasionally, an anesthetic procedure is required (O’Grady et al. 2000; Batra et al. 2016; Himel et al. 1994; Best et al. 1995; Ghosh et al. 2015). Because fibrin sealant adheres to the entire surface, hematoma/seroma formation is significantly reduced compared with point-fixation sutures or staples (Cha et al. 2012; Gibran et al. 2007; Llanos et al. 2006; Myer et al. 2015; Mabrouk et al. 2013). According to previous studies, fibrin sealant is effective for graft take, particularly in joint and extremity areas that experience difficulty in postoperative immobilization. In addition, suture and staple marks are not formed, and the frequency of hypertrophic scar development caused by ischemic mechanical fixation is reduced (Mittermayr et al. 2006). Moreover, the enhanced graft take rate can result in decreased hospital stay as well as scar management costs, leading to overall cost savings even though fibrin sealant is more expensive and this cost could influence the total cost (Mittermayr et al. 2006). However, commercially available <b>fibrin</b> sealants contain <b>bovine</b> aprotinin and thrombin, which can theoretically result in transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or other viral diseases (Currie et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|A novel {{therapeutic}} {{approach for}} the treatment of bone defects is gene therapy assisted bone tissue engineering using bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) on proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of primary hBMSC in vitro. hBMSC cultures were achieved by explantation culture of bone chips. Following exposure to 0 - 10 ng recombinant hEGF (rhEGF) /ml cell numbers were determined by automated cell counting and cell bound AP activity was measured spectrophotometrically. hBMSC were transfected with hEGF plasmids and the proliferative effect was studied by cocultivation of transfected and untreated cells using porous cell culture inserts. The persistence of hEGF expression even after cell transfer was studied by the generation of possibly osteogenic constructs introducing transfected hBMSC in <b>fibrin</b> glue and <b>bovine</b> cancellous bone. The maximum increase in proliferation (156 +/- 7 %) and AP activity (220 +/- 34 %) was detected after exposition to 10 ng rhEGF/ml. In the separation chamber assay transfected cells produced hEGF concentrations up to 3. 6 ng/ml, which induced a mean proliferation increase of 93 % which could be significantly inhibited by a neutralizing hEGF antibody. Further, EGFsecretion of transfected hBMSC in 3 D-culture was verified. Recombinant and transgenic hEGF stimulate proliferation of primary hBMSC in vitro.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic partial {{nephrectomy}} (LPN) is a technically challenging {{procedure for}} the management of renal tumours. Major complications of LPN include bleeding and urine leakage. Haemostatic agents (HAs) and/or glues may reduce haemorrhage and urine leakage. We sought to examine the current practice patterns for urologists performing LPN with regard to HA use and its relationship with bleeding and urine leakage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was sent via e-mail to urologists currently performing LPN in centres in the United States and Europe. We queried the indications for HA/glue usage, type of HAs/glues used, and whether concomitant suturing/bolstering was performed. In addition, the total number of LPNs performed, laparoscopic tools used to resect the tumour, tumour size, and tumour position were queried. RESULTS: Surveys suitable for analysis were received from 18 centres (n= 1347 cases). HAs and/or glues were used in 1042 (77. 4 %) cases. Mean tumour size was 2. 8 cm, with 79 % of the tumours being defined as exophytic and 21 % deep. The HAs and glues used included gelatin matrix thrombin (FloSeal), <b>fibrin</b> gel (Tisseel), <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BioGlue), cyanoacrylate glue (Glubran), oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel), or combinations of these. Sixteen centres performed concomitant suturing/bolstering. The overall postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion and urine leakage rates were 2. 7 % and 1. 9 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HAs and/or glues is routine in most centres performing LPN. The overall haemorrhage and urine leakage rates are low following LPN.

Eight centers reported on tumor position {{for a total of}} 407 cases with 338 exophytic tumors (83 %) and 69 deep lesions (17 %). Four centers, accounting for 185 cases, did not report on tumor position. All the centers performed their LNSS by clamping the hilum. The warm ischemia time was < 30 min in all the centers. The positive margin rate was 2 % (12 / 592). Hemostatic agents and/or sealant or tissue glues were used in 86 % of cases (511 / 592). Types of sealants used included: gelatine matrix (Floseal), <b>fibrin</b> gel (Tissucol), <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BioGlue) and cianacrylate (Glubran). Two Centres never used sealants, one center used only sealants without suturing and 9 centers used a combination of sealants and bolstering-sutures.

40|$|The fibrinolytic or {{thrombolytic}} {{activity of}} {{low molecular weight}} urokinase (LMW-UK) and high molecular weight urokinase (HMW-UK) is not significantly different when measured in a <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin</b> plate method, in a circulating plasma system containing a 125 I-labelled human fibrin clot, or on 125 I-fibrin films in culture plates using normal or alpha 2 -antiplasmin depleted human plasma. In a human fibrin plate method however HMW-UK {{was found to be}} more active than LMW-UK. In a purified system on human 125 I-fibrin films the activation of native or modified human plasminogen by HMW-UK was also found to be more effective than by LMW-UK. Using a clot lysis test system we did not observed a different inhibition of LMW-UK and HMW-UK upon incubation in human plasma. This is in contrast with previous reports that HMW-UK is inhibited more rapidly in human plasma than LMW-UK. In a purified system the inhibition rate of LMW-UK and HMW-UK by alpha 2 -antiplasmin is the same (rate constants at 25 degree C of 167 +/- 9 M- 1 s- 1 and 171 +/- 5 M- 1 s- 1 respectively). The clinical trials available at present used doses of urokinase which were in excess of those required to obtain a maximal fibrinolytic effect. This might explain why in these trials no difference was observed between the thrombolytic effect of LMW-UK and HMW-UK, while in vitro HMW-UK appeared to be more effective.

Synthetic serine protease inhibitors presented only weak inhibition, e. g., benzamidine with K-i = 3. 0 x 10 (- 4) M and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) showed traces of inhibition. the purified trypsin-like enzyme also digested natural substrates such as fibrinogen and fibrin net. the protease showed higher activity against fibrinogen and <b>fibrin</b> than did <b>bovine</b> trypsin.

40|$|Fibrinolytic {{phenomenon}} {{is attributed to}} an increase of plasmin which is activated by the system of proactivator and activator. The fibrin plate method, which is widely used at present {{for the purpose of}} measuring plasmin, has some disadvantages when quantitative measurement of a very small amount of plasmin is required. In this report, the fibrin tube method which was newly devised for the purpose of titrating a very small amount of plasmin is described. Moreover, plasma plasmin in normal healthy persons and that of patients with various diseases was measured by this new method and a relation between diseases and their plasmin value is discussed. Thus, in order to appreciate the property of serum and tissue activators, we tried to separate and extract activators from human serum and tissues. After the measurement method of the tissue activators was examined, the value of activator was determined concerning cancer tissues and mucosae of gastric ulcer obtained from the surgical specimens, and gastric mucosae and various organs from sudden death cadavers. Finally, the corresponding relationship between the activator value and the plasmin value is discussed. I. Fibrin-Tube Method. (1) The fibrin obtained from various animals was examined first. The coagulating conditions of the fibrin incubated for 18 hrs. at 37 ℃. was investigated, and it was found that <b>bovine</b> <b>fibrin</b> was most available in the bovine, canine, pig 2 ̆ 7 s and rabbit 2 ̆ 7 s fibrin. (2) Astrup 2 ̆ 7 s fibrin plate method was then examined. Conditions of fibrinolysis of the plate colored with carmin suspension were investigated, and four types of fibrinolysis could be differentiated in consequence. 1) Type I : Saucer form- the lysis which does not reach {{to the base of the}} petri dish. 2) Type II : Crater form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, but the area of lysis is narrower at the base than at the surface. 3) Type III : Complete form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, and the area of the base is equal to that of the surface. 4) Type IV : Triangle flask form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, but the area of lysis is larger at the base than at the surface. These four types of lysis could not be differentiate by the non-colored plat method of Astrup 2 ̆ 7 s. At the time of practical measurement of the lysed area, the value varied in how to decide the lysed diameter. In the case of type I, particularly, the quantitative measurement of plasmin became impossible. (3) For the purpose of quantitative measurement of plasmin, especially that of low activity such as in healthy normal persons, the fibrin tube method was devised in this report. A mass of fibrin colored with carmin was prepared in glass tubes which had a constant inner diameter, and the material to be measured was piled on the mass. The lysed distance was then measured after incubation. As a result of this examination under various conditions, the following was adopted in this report : a clottable protein concentration of 400 mg/dl; the volume of material used was 1. 0 ml; and measurement of the lysed distance was done after incubation for 18 hrs. at 37 ℃. The fibrin tube method could be compared with the fibrin plate method by means of multiplying the certain conistants. (4) Lastly, the heated fibrin tube method was attempted. The water bath for 10 minutes at 55 ℃. was most convenient, because of less degeneration of the fibrin, and satisfactory inactivation of the plasmin in the fibrin mass. II.
