40|$|Owing {{to growing}} demand for {{comfortable}} clothes, elastane <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> are being used in fabrics for several garments. In this study, core spun yarns were produced with cotton fibres and PBT/elastane <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> (cotton as sheath material, PBT yarn and elastane as core yarns). Twill woven (1 / 3 Z) fabrics were produced by using core spun yarns (30 tex) and cotton yarns (30 tex) as weft, and 100 % cotton yarn (59 tex) as warp yarns. The fabrics consisting of PBT were washed at 100 °C for 30 minutes to gain the elasticity. The woven fabrics’ weight, thickness, elongation, permanent elongation, dimensional stability, air permeability, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity characteristics were tested and statistically evaluated. According to the results, the fabrics containing PBT and elastane filaments had similar elongation and shrinkage values.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the research {{work done in}} the framework of the Collaborative Research Centre – Textile Reinforcement for Structural Strengthening and Retrofitting. Previous results of textile reinforced concrete (TRC) have shown that the mechanical properties of the applied open grid warp knitted fabrics made of alkali-resistant glass <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> or carbon <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> as reinforcement material have not been utilized to complete satisfaction in the composition with the mineral matrix system. Further we have noticed that the orientation and configuration of the reinforcing fiber material is quite influenced by the handling in the further processing steps, which leads to the need of a sustainable structural stabilization. Different technologies for a subsequent structural stabilization e. g., dip-or spray coating with water-based polymer dispersions, thermal bonding, and laminating have been investigated. The results of these preliminary investigations have been published [2] and in consequence a suitable technology for a structural strengthening process has been selected.

50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon <b>filament</b> <b>yarn,</b> but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|E

40|$|The {{geometrical}} model of yarn currently in use {{is assumed to}} be a circular cylindrical under the bending deformation, but this assumption is not really true because the cross-section of yarn has to change to an elliptic shape when the compressive force acted on the yarn is considered. Therefore, as the first part of a series of work, the present paper considers the fact that yarn geometry changes from a circular cylindrical to an elliptical cylindrical under an external applied bending moment, and then analyzes the relationship of bending rigidity between constituent filaments and the formed yarn, which is useful in predicting or selecting specified bending property of filaments by the requirements of yarn. In the present paper, the bending and torsional energies stored in filaments are analyzed according to their deformations by the energy method. The explicit formula is then obtained to quantify the bending rigidity relationship between the <b>filament</b> and <b>yarn,</b> in which four characters are featured as the eccentricity of elliptical cross-section of yarn, the ratio of bending to torsional rigidity of filament, the helix angle of the <b>filament</b> on <b>yarn</b> surface and the number of <b>filaments</b> inside the <b>yarn.</b> Moreover, the bending rigidity of <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> formulated by an earlier method with a circle shape assumption can also be obtained by the proposed method with the eccentricity being equal to zero. Based on the analytical solution, the earlier method in which the circle shape takes place of the elliptical shape of yarn for simplification can also be evaluated.
