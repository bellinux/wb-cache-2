[...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it.

Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In New South Wales, {{students}} are being issued with Lenovo laptops {{no bigger than}} a sheet of A4 paper. In 2009 the model issued was the IdeaPad S10e, in 2010, the ThinkPad Mini 10 in 2011, the ThinkPad Edge 11, in 2012 the ThinkPad X130e which has been uniquely designed [...] and in 2013, the ThinkPad X131e. The laptops also come with pre-installed software, such as Adobe CS5, Adobe LiveCycle ES2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Forefront. In June 2010 a recall of laptop cases was issued after it was found that there was a flaw {{in the design of the}} case when several students reported that their screens had cracks. The New South Wales Department of Education and Training's Chief Information Officer Stephen Wilson said that the filtering system on the laptops is impervious and no student will be able to break through the system. [...] "Our internet filtering is unbreakable. We have a huge proxy array that does all the filtering. We've just brought that in-house and the reason we have done that is we want much tighter control over it, every internet site that's known is actually categorised. If it isn't known, it's blocked. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> site and it's not categorised you can't get to it," [...] said Wilson.|$|E

Plant, insect, bird, what not--Find a weaker plant, insect, bird, than yourself, and kill it, and take possession of its little vineyard, and no Naboth's curse shall follow you: but you shall inherit, and thrive therein, you, and your children after you, if they will be only as strong and as cruel as you are. That is Nature's law: and is it not at first sight a fearful law? Internecine competition, ruthless selfishness, so internecine and so ruthless that, as I have wandered in tropic forests, where this temper is shown more quickly and fiercely, though not in the least more evilly, than in our slow and cold temperate one, I have said--Really these trees and plants are as wicked as so many human beings.|$|E

No; since coming to this city I have developed a habit {{of taking care of}} myself, or employing private help.

60|$|Thus, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{garden to}} buy flowers, plants, trees, and greens, {{if you know}} what you go about, know the names of flowers, or simples, or greens; know the {{particular}} beauties of them, when they are fit to remove, and when to slip and draw, and when not; what colour is ordinary, and what rare; when a flower is rare, and when ordinary--the gardener presently talks to you as to a man of art, tells you that you are a lover of art, a friend to a florist, shows you his exotics, his green-house, and his stores; what he has set out, and what he has budded or enarched, and the like; but if he finds you have none of the terms of art, know little or nothing of the names of plants, or the nature of planting, he picks your pocket instantly, shows you a fine trimmed fuz-bush for a juniper, sells you common pinks for painted ladies, an ordinary tulip for a rarity, and the like. Thus I saw a gardener sell a gentleman a large yellow auricula, that is to say, a running away, for a curious flower, and take a great price. It seems, the gentleman was a lover of a good yellow; and it is known, that when nature in the auricula is exhausted, and has spent her strengh in showing a fine flower, perhaps some years upon the same root, she faints at last, and then turns into a yellow, which yellow shall be bright and pleasant the first year, and look very well to one that knows nothing of it, though another year it turns pale, and at length almost white. This the gardeners call a run flower, and this they put upon the gentleman for a rarity, only because he discovered at his coming that he knew nothing of the matter. The same gardener sold another person a root of white painted thyme for the right Marum Syriacum; and thus they do every day.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{combination}} {{breakfast is}} a form of table d'hôte; and at a very attractive restaurant in a good place I have seen such a breakfast--fruit, cereal, eggs, rolls, and coffee--offered for fifteen cents. I have never tried it, not because I had not the courage, but because I thought thirty cents cheap enough; those who do not I should still hold worthy of esteem if they ate the fifteen-cent breakfast. I have also seen placarded a 'business men's lunch' for fifteen cents, which also I have not tried; I am not a business man. I make bold to say, however, that I often go for my lunch or my dinner to a certain Italian place on a good avenue, which I will not locate more definitely lest you should think me a partner of the enterprise, for fifty and sixty cents, 'vino compreso.' The material is excellent, and the treatment is artistic; the company of a simple and self-respectful domesticity which I think it an honor to be part of: fathers and mothers of families, aunts, cousins, uncles, grandparents. I do not deny a Merry Widow hat here and there, but the face under it, though often fair and young, is not a Merry Widow face. Those people all look as kind and harmless as the circle which I used to frequent farther down-town at a fifty-cent French table d'hôte, but with a bouillabaisse added which I should not, but for my actual experiences, have expected to buy for any money. But there are plenty of Italian and French tables d'hôte for the same price all over town. If you venture outside of the Latin race, you pay dearer and you fare worse, unless you go to those shining halls which I have been praising. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> German place, you get grosser dishes and uncouth manners for more money; I do not know why that amiable race should be so dear and rude in its feeding-places, but that is my experience." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the truth}} is, {{that to the}} {{moderately}} poor the home {{is the only place}} of liberty. Nay, it is the only place of anarchy. It is the only spot on the earth where a man can alter arrangements suddenly, make an experiment or indulge in a whim. Everywhere else he goes he must accept the strict rules of the shop, inn, club, or museum that he happens to enter. He can eat his meals on the floor in his own house if he likes. I often do it myself; it gives a curious, childish, poetic, picnic feeling. There would be considerable trouble if I tried to do it in an A.B.C. tea-shop. A man can wear a dressing gown and slippers in his house; while I am sure that this would not be permitted at the Savoy, though I never actually tested the point. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> restaurant you must drink some of the wines on the wine list, all of them if you insist, but certainly some of them. But if you have a house and garden you can try to make hollyhock tea or convolvulus wine if you like. For a plain, hard-working man the home is not the one tame place in the world of adventure. It is the one wild place in the world of rules and set tasks. The home is the one place where he can put the carpet on the ceiling or the slates on the floor if he wants to. When a man spends every night staggering from bar to bar or from music-hall to music-hall, we say that he is living an irregular life. But he is not; he is living a highly regular life, under the dull, and often oppressive, laws of such places. Some times he is not allowed even to sit down in the bars; and frequently he is not allowed to sing in the music-halls. Hotels may be defined as places where you are forced to dress; and theaters may be defined as places where you are forbidden to smoke. A man can only picnic at home.|$|E

This is the first Woody Allen film {{to go through a}} digital intermediate, instead of being color timed in the traditional photochemical way.
