We use different time-invariant and time-varying copula functions, with different forms of tail dependence, and discover a positive dependence between all <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> although the dependence is less strong for the JPY-pairs of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Furthermore, we find evidence of symmetric tail dependence. Finally, the dependence is time-varying and intensifies after {{the onset of the}} recent global financial crisis, {{with the exception of the}} JPY-pairs. These findings provide additional insight for international investors, risk managers and for policy makers, given the fact that the tail dependence is either positive or negative, is time-changing, and have different structures...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{main purpose}} of the paper is {{applying}} filter rules to examine the efficiency of foreign exchange. This paper uses three strategies of filter rules (buy long, sell short, buy long and sell short strategies) to test {{the performance of the}} transaction for EUR, JPY, GBP. The findings show that people will obtain more return by taking buy long/sell short strategies of filter rules without considering transaction cost. However, the transaction of these three foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>EUR,</b> JPY, GBP) will be more efficient by considering transaction cost.

The calibration of our model is performed on data from EEX AG allowing us to capture the specific features of German electricity market.

40|$|The Euro (EUR) {{has been}} a {{currency}} introduced by the European Community on Jan. 01, 1999. This implies eleven countries of the European Union which {{have been found to}} meet the five requirements of the Maastricht convergence criteria.

We have derived the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the FEUR with respect to several currencies of interest not belonging to the EUR, i. e., Danish Kroner (DKK), Swiss Franc (CHF), Japanese Yen (JPY) and U.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a version of}} the P* model of inflation dynamics for a small open economy and applies it to the Czech economy time series from the period of 1991 - 1999. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 {{presents a}} brief discussion of the monetary policy indicators issue. Section 3 describes the logics of the P* model. Section 4 explains the extension of the basic model to the case of a small open economy. Section 5 applies the model to the Czech economy data and presents the estimates of the Czech inflation dynamics determination. The results of the estimates suggest that the dynamics of the Czech inflation evolves in line with a P* model logic: the inflation in the current period changes to close the price gap, i. e. the gap between actual and equilibrium price level. The foreign component of the price gap seems to be more important than domestic component which supports the hypothesis that the equilibrium price level in the Czech Republic is to a large extent determined by the monetary policy in the EU via the explicit or implicit peg of the Czech currency <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> to <b>EUR.</b> The overall results show that the inflation in the Czech Republic is primarily a monetary phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|On Jan. 1, 1999 the European Union {{introduced}} a common currency Euro (EUR), {{to become the}} legal currency in all eleven countries which form the EUR. In order to test the EUR behavior and understand various features, the <b>EUR</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is artificially extrapolated back to 1993 by a linear superposition of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the 11 currencies composing EUR with respect to several currencies not belonging to the EUR, i. e.

The distribution of fluctuations of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is shown to be Gaussian for {{the central part of}} the distribution, and having fat tails for the large size fluctuations.

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;Economic conditions;exchange <b>rate,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, inflation performance, terms of trade, foreign exchange, lower inflation, monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, macroeconomic performance, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation targeting, money growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> high inflation, annual inflation, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classification, inflation <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rigidity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, terms of trade shocks, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, rigid <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> inflationary expectations, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> reserves, money supply, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> natural <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rate of inflation, real interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency values, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, post-crisis period, currency boards, official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, variable inflation, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, average inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, monetary economics, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, stable <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> black market, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> price inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> band, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, currency areas, currency convertibility, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> low inflation, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> path, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, inflation growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classifications, macroeconomic stability, explicit <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> controls, inflation target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choice, freely floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real rates, independent central bank, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> unification, average inflation <b>rate,</b> intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> annual inflation <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangement, bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> information, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crises, basket of currencies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choices...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{creating}} a new currency union is setting the rates to convert national currencies into the new union currency. Planned unions in the Gulf region and Africa are seeking methods to set the conversion rates when their new currencies are created. We propose a forward-looking econometric methodology to determine conversion rates by calculating the degree of misalignment in the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and apply it to}} the GCC currency union. For each GCC currency, we identify the year at which the economy is the closest to its internal and external equilibrium, and then estimate the degree of misalignment in the bilateral real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> vis-Ã -vis the U. S. dollar based on WEO forecasts until 2013. Application of the methodology to other regions is also considered.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{guidance}} on the operational aspects of official {{intervention in the}} foreign exchange market, particularly in developing countries with flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes. A brief survey of the literature and country experience is followed by {{an analysis of the}} objectives, timing, amount, degree of transparency, and choice of markets and counterparties in conducting intervention. The analysis highlights the difficulty of detecting <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignments and disorderly markets, and argues in favor of parsimony in official intervention. Determining the timing and amount of intervention is a highly subjective excercise, and some degree of discretion is almost necessary, though policy rules may serve as "rules of thumb.

40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} intraday {{dynamics}} of the high frequency US Dollar (USD) -Euro (<b>EUR)</b> and <b>US</b> Dollar (USD) -Japanese Yen (JPY) foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> that {{have been subject to}} macroeconomic fundamentals. Even though the FIGARCH model with a normality assumption is found to be a good starting point, it appears to be inappropriate to represent the underlying movements of the high frequency returns due to the occurrences of jumps. Hence, this paper relies on the FIGARCH model with the mixture distribution that allows for the time-varying jumps that are determined by the US macroeconomic surprises. This paper generally finds that the US macroeconomic surprises are closely related to the intraday movements in the volatility process of the high frequency returns process through the jumps. In particular, the US macroeconomic surprises appear to affect the movements in the volatility process of the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> asymmetrically depending on the signs of the surprises and spuriously increasing the long memory persistence in the volatility process due to the jumps.
