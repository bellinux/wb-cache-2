5|$|The {{tawny owl}} hunts almost entirely at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight when it has young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up {{to the size of a}} young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eaten.|$|E
5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> asks why Ser Arthur was {{not present}} at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies {{that he has been}} ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E

5|$|Instances of {{war crimes}} were alleged to have {{occurred}} {{on both sides of}} the conflict, and troops from both the UN and North Korea were involved in several high-profile incidents. The North Korean troops, in occupying South Korea, were accused of many instances of abuse of prisoners of war captured during the fighting. Most serious among these were accusations that some captured UN prisoners were tortured and executed. Isolated incidents of prisoners being beaten, castrated, burned to death, and used for bayonet practice arose. In the Taegu region, groups of captured soldiers were found executed with their hands bound. This was also known to have occurred at Masan, where isolated instances of prisoners being used as human shields against other UN troops were known to have taken place. Critically wounded UN troops were known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> in at least one instance, unarmed chaplains and medics were attacked despite wearing proper identification.

Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.|$|E
