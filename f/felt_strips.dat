50|$|Wing and Son of New York {{offered a}} five-pedal piano from {{approximately}} 1893 through the 1920s. There {{is no mention}} of the company past the 1930s. Labeled left to right, the pedals are Mandolin, Orchestra, Expression, Soft, and Forte (Sustain). The Orchestral pedal produced a sound similar to a tremolo feel by bouncing a set of small beads dangling against the strings, enabling the piano to mimic a mandolin, guitar, banjo, zither and harp, thus the name Orchestral. The Mandolin pedal used a similar approach, lowering a set of <b>felt</b> <b>strips</b> with metal rings in between the hammers and the strings (aka rinky-tink effect). This extended the life of the hammers when the Orch pedal was used, a good idea for practicing, and created an echo-like sound that mimicked playing in an orchestral hall.|$|E
5000|$|Chalkboard erasers {{were first}} invented around 1863 by John L. Hammett, who owned some stores that sold and created school {{products}} in Rhode Island {{and then later}} in Boston. Mostly slates were sold there as well as chalk and so on. At the time, rags or old cloths were used to erase {{and get rid of}} the chalk markings on slates in schools, offices, and for the most part, everywhere. Hammett created the chalkboard before the invention of the chalkboard eraser by creating slating paint. Hammett then, during a presentation on his chalkboard [...] "discovered" [...] that wool <b>felt</b> <b>strips</b> wiped off the chalk writing better than rags. Following this discovery he gathered a team to create the custom eraser for sale. The erasers proved to be a success for Hammett and, later in the 19th century, he created a company that also sold inexpensive supplies for teachers and schools, such as paper, ink, etc. Hammett ultimately sold the company.|$|E

5000|$|Common {{tools for}} tuning pianos include the tuning lever or [...] "hammer", {{a variety of}} mutes, and a tuning fork or {{electronic}} tuning device. The tuning lever is used to turn the tuning pins, increasing or decreasing the tension of the string. Mutes are used to silence strings that are not being tuned. While tuning the temperament octave, a <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> is typically placed within the temperament (middle) section of the piano; it is inserted between each note's trichord, muting its outer two strings so that only the middle string is free to vibrate. After the center strings are all tuned, the <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> can be removed note by note, tuning the outer strings to the center strings. Wedge-shaped mutes are inserted between two strings to mute them, while a Papps mute is sometimes used for tuning the high notes in upright pianos because it slides easily between hammer shanks.|$|R
40|$|A 59 -year-old male patient {{underwent}} surgery for triple-vessel {{coronary artery disease}} and left-ventricular aneurysm in 1994. Four months after coronary artery bypass grafting and classical left-ventricular aneurysmectomy (with Teflon <b>felt</b> <b>strips),</b> a left-ventricular pseudoaneurysm developed due to infection, and this was treated surgically with an autologous glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium patch over which an omental pedicle graft was placed. Two months later, under emergent conditions, re-repair was performed with a diaphragmatic pericardial pedicle graft due to pseudoaneurysm reformation and rupture. A 3 rd repair was required in a 3 rd episode 8 months later. Sternocostal resection enabled implantation of the left pectoralis major muscle into the ventricular defect. Six months after the last surgical intervention, the patient died of cerebral malignancy. Pseudoaneurysm reformation, however, had not been observed. To our knowledge, our case is the 1 st {{reported in the literature}} in which there have been 3 or more different operative techniques applied to 3 or more distinct episodes of pseudoaneurysm formation secondary to post-aneurysmectomy infection.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{sandwich}} double-patch {{technique was}} adopted {{as an alternative}} method for reconstruction of the left ventricle after excision of postinfarction dysfunctional myocardium to solve technical problems due to the thick edges of the ventricular wall. Methods Over a 5 -year period, 12 of 21 patients with postinfarction antero-apical left ventricular aneurysm had thick wall edges after wall excision. It was due to akinetic muscular thick tissue in 6 cases, while in the other 6 with classic fibrous aneurysm, thick edges remained after the cut of the border zone. The ventricular opening was sandwiched between two patches {{and this is a}} technique which is currently used for the treatment of the interventricular septum rupture. In our patients the patches are much smaller than the removed aneurysm and they were sutured simply by a single row of single stitches. However, in contrast to interventricular septum rupture where the patches loosen the tension of the tissues, in our patients the patches pull strongly and restrain the walls by fastening their edges and supporting tight stitches. In this way they could narrow the cavity and close the ventricle. Results The resected area varied from 5 × 4 to 8 × 8 cm. Excision was extended into the interventricular septum in 5 patients, thus opening the right ventricle. CABG was performed on all patients but two. Left ventricular volumes and the ejection fraction changed significantly: end-systolic volume 93. 5 ± 12. 4 to 57. 8 ± 8. 9 ml, p Conclusion The double-patch sandwich technique (bi-patch closure) offers some advantages and does not result in increased morbidity and mortality. In the case of excising a left ventricular aneurysm, this technique in no way requires eversion of the edges, <b>felt</b> <b>strips,</b> buttressed and multiple sutures, all of which are needed for longitudinal linear closure. Moreover, it does not require purse string sutures, endocardial scar remnant to secure the patch or folding the excluded non-functional tissue, all of which are needed for endoventricular patch repair. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{decrease}} both energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, the automotive, aeronautics and aerospace industries aim at making lighter vehicles. To achieve this, composite materials provide good opportunities, ensuring high material properties and free definition of geometry. As an example, for cold applications, {{the use of}} carbon fiber/thermoset composites is ever increasing, {{in spite of a}} high fiber price. But in a global and eco-friendly approach, the major limitation for their use remains their potential recyclability. Recycling a composite means having a recycling technology available, getting a dismantle solution and an access for the product, and disposing identification plus selection possibilities to the materials. Thus, carbon fibers recovery (i. e. recycling and re-processing) would both help design engineers to balance energy efficiency and cost, and open new opportunities for developing second-life composites, dedicated to the manufacture of medium or low loaded parts (non-structural in many cases). A first section presents an overview of composite recycling possibilities. Indeed, environmentally and economically, composite incineration is not attractive (even with an energetic valorization), let-alone burying. Reuse and recycling thus remain the two most interesting options. Aeronautics offers a high potential in terms of fiber deposit. In southwest France, composites recycling will increase in terms of quantity due to dismantling platforms TARMAC (dedicated to civil aircraft applications) and P 2 P (for the disassembly of ballistic weapons). In addition, from a technical point of view, and even if end-of-life solutions for composites still remain under development, solvolysis (i. e. water under supercritical conditions) already offers the opportunity to recover carbon fibers. The resulting recyclate retains up to 90 percent of the fiber's mechanical properties. A second part will explore the recycling to design issue (i. e. how recycling processes have to balance the previous aspects of the end-of-life proposal). The recycler clearly becomes a new supplier in the carbon fiber lifecycle, by revalorizing wastes with alternatives to burning. Moreover, increasing carbon fiber shelf life reduces its product life impact. Finally, promoting carbon fiber end-of-life would ensure to link aeronautics, automotive, and leisure and sports industries; but one can create demand for recycled reinforcement, by packaging it in useful and attractive forms for those end-users (e. g. pseudo-continuous fiber, <b>felt,</b> <b>strips,</b> bands, patches, etc.). These sections will be enlightened by several examples from collaborations between I 2 M and local industries...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWrapping {{methods have}} been widely used to {{reinforce}} the anastomotic site in vascular surgery; however, postoperative changes in the aortic wall wrapped by nonbiodegradable felt have not been well characterized. The purposes of this investigation are to elucidate the sequelae of wrapping with nonbiodegradable felt on the aortic wall and to modify those changes by using biodegradable felt with or without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). MethodsThe descending thoracic aortas of 15 beagles were wrapped with three different materials: nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, biodegradable polyglycol acid (PGA) material, and PGA with 100 μg bFGF (n = 5 in each group). The descending thoracic aorta was resected after 3 months. The thickness of the aortic wall, vessel density in the media and the adventitia, and the wall strength were assessed. Untreated native aortic wall served as a normal control. ResultsThe thickness of the media of the PTFE group was lower than that of the PGA + bFGF group (66 % ± 5 % vs 85 % ± 6 % of control, P <. 05). The adventitia-media ratio in the PTFE group decreased compared with controls (59. 1 % of normal, P < 0. 05), whereas those in the PGA and PGA + bFGF groups increased (172. 1 % and 189. 6 % of normal, respectively, P <. 01). The collagen-smooth muscle ratio in the media was higher in the PTFE group than in the controls (0. 14 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 07 ± 0. 01, P <. 01). The number of vessels in the adventitia was higher in the PGA + bFGF group than those in PTFE or PGA groups (29. 6 ± 2. 5 /mm 2 vs 6. 4 ± 0. 8 /mm 2, 19. 0 ± 1. 1 /mm 2, P <. 01). The PGA + bFGF group demonstrated larger failure force than the PTFE group (4. 0 ± 0. 3 kgf vs 1. 6 ± 0. 3 kgf, P <. 01). The failure stress in the PGA and PGA + bFGF groups was larger than that in PTFE group (PTFE:PGA + bFGF = 5. 3 ± 0. 9 × 102 kPa: 11. 7 ± 1. 7 × 102 kPa, P <. 01; PTFE:PGA = 5. 3 ± 0. 9 × 102 kPa: 11. 2 ± 1. 2 × 102 kPa, P <. 05). ConclusionThe aortic wall wrapped with nonbiodegradable PTFE felt showed a reduced thickness and diminished vessels in the adventitia. Biodegradable felt (PGA), with or without bFGF, modified these histologic changes. The vessel-rich thickened adventitia, after wrapping by PGA with bFGF, was associated with increased aortic wall strength. Clinical RelevanceThis investigation was conducted in an attempt to elucidate mechanisms underlying the occurrence of late postoperative false aneurysm after aortic surgery. We hypothesized that sustaining compression of the aorta by the <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> may cause structural derangement and local ischemia on the aortic wall. We used a simple wrapping of the aorta with a <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> rather than a <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> at anastomotic sites to simplify the experimental model and to exclude confounding factors brought by technical inconsistency on the surgical anastomosis. We further attempted to find a clue for preventing adverse effects of wrapping with a conventional <b>felt</b> <b>strip.</b> Practically, we pursued a possible application of a biodegradable <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> to aortic wrapping in our experimental model before we proceed in a clinical application of the new material...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{the outcomes of}} reinforcing anastomotic sites using (1) nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, (2) biodegradable polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt, and (3) PGA felt with {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) in a canine descending thoracic aortic replacement model. MethodsThirty-seven beagles underwent descending thoracic aorta replacement using a prosthetic graft with one of the above-mentioned reinforcements or no reinforcement for controls. Histologic evaluations were carried out 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The biomechanical strength of the anastomosis was assessed along the longitudinal axis of the aortic segments using a tensile tester. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was also evaluated in the circumferential direction. ResultsThe media was significantly thinner in the PTFE group than in the control group (65. 8 % ± 5. 1 % vs 95. 0 % ± 9. 3 % of normal thickness; P <. 05). Relative to the control group, the adventitial layer was significantly thinner in the PTFE group (42. 3 % ± 8. 2 % of control; P <. 05) but significantly thicker in the PGA and the PGA + bFGF groups (117. 2 % ± 11. 3 % and 134. 1 % ± 14. 2 % of control, respectively; P <. 05). There were more vessels in the adventitial layer in the PGA + bFGF group than in the control, PTFE, and PGA groups (29. 2 ± 2. 1 /mm 2 vs 13. 8 ± 0. 8, 5. 4 ± 0. 7, 17. 0 ± 1. 3 /mm 2, respectively; P <. 01). There {{were no significant differences between}} the four groups in the failure force at anastomotic sites. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was higher in the PGA group than that in the PTFE group (11. 6 ± 1. 6 10 − 6 m 2 /N vs 5. 6 ± 1. 9 10 − 6 m 2 /N; P <. 05). ConclusionReinforcement of the experimental aortic wall with PTFE felt resulted in thinning of the media and adventitia and fewer vessels at the anastomotic site. These histologic changes were not observed when biodegradable felt was used. The bFGF failed to augment the modification of the aortic wall with the exception of increased adventitial vessel number. Biomechanical strength of the anastomosis along the longitudinal axis was comparable in all four groups; however, local vascular compliance was better in the biodegradable PGA felt group. Clinical RelevanceThis investigation was conducted to extend our previous investigation on a biodegradable <b>felt</b> <b>strip</b> into more practical form before we proceed in a clinical application of the new material.
