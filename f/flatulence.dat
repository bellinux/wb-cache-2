5|$|Bismuth subgallate, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in Devrom, is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from <b>flatulence</b> ("gas") and feces.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of cabbage {{may lead to}} increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and <b>flatulence</b> due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot digest.|$|E
5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of <b>flatulence</b> is audible. This sound, {{apparently}} unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of <b>flatulence</b> humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5|$|Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, a naïve warthog {{who suffers}} from <b>flatulence</b> and is Timon's best friend and also becomes one of Simba's best friends and adoptive parents. Tony Bancroft served as his supervising animator.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged <b>flatulence</b> in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone {{stepping}} on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess <b>flatulence,</b> and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They are {{reportedly}} {{consumed by the}} tribal people of Madhya Pradesh. In Mexico, a large collection was consumed by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five who ate the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, <b>flatulence,</b> and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's <b>flatulence,</b> the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries {{to run away from}} any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his <b>flatulence</b> affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises to the rank of brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the <b>flatulence,</b> while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics (live yogurt, kefir, etc.) are {{reputed to}} reduce <b>flatulence</b> when used to restore balance {{to the normal}} {{intestinal}} flora. Live (bioactive) yogurt contains, among other lactic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, which {{may be useful in}} reducing <b>flatulence.</b> L. acidophilus may make the intestinal environment more acidic, supporting a natural balance of the fermentative processes. L. acidophilus is available in supplements. Prebiotics, which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharide, generally increase <b>flatulence</b> in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, <b>flatulence</b> invalidates wudu (ritual purity).|$|E
25|$|Some infections, such as giardiasis, {{are also}} {{associated}} with <b>flatulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{malabsorption}} {{may cause}} gastrointestinal {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, bloating, <b>flatulence</b> or diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Paleoclimatology {{research}} {{published in}} Current Biology suggests that <b>flatulence</b> from dinosaurs may have warmed the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The ʿAbid Rahim {{cultivar}} is favoured in Eastern Sudan. These {{dates are}} said to cause <b>flatulence</b> when consumed in large quantities.|$|E
25|$|One {{very common}} aftereffect from the {{procedure}} is a bout of <b>flatulence</b> and minor wind pain caused by air insufflation into the colon during the procedure.|$|E
25|$|While not {{affecting}} {{the production of}} the gases themselves, surfactants (agents that lower surface tension) can reduce the disagreeable sensations associated with <b>flatulence,</b> by aiding the dissolution of the gases into liquid and solid faecal matter. Preparations containing simethicone reportedly operate by promoting the coalescence of smaller bubbles into larger ones more easily passed from the body, either by burping or <b>flatulence.</b> Such preparations do not decrease the total amount of gas generated in or passed from the colon, but make the bubbles larger and thereby allowing them to be passed more easily.|$|E
25|$|Burdock, {{crushed and}} mixed with salt, useful in {{treating}} dog bites, and taken inwardly to help pass <b>flatulence,</b> an analgesic for tooth pain and {{to strengthen the}} back.|$|E
25|$|Activated carbon is used {{to treat}} poisonings and overdoses {{following}} oral ingestion. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and <b>flatulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of fermentation, shorter-chain {{carbohydrates}} (a type of fiber found in legumes) cannot be digested, but are changed via fermentation in the colon into short-chain fatty acids and gases (which are typically expelled as <b>flatulence).</b>|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} include headache, nausea, diarrhea, {{abdominal}} pain, fatigue, and dizziness. Infrequent adverse effects include rash, itch, <b>flatulence,</b> constipation, anxiety, and depression. Also infrequently, PPI use {{may be associated}} with occurrence of myopathies, including the serious reaction rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flatulence</b> {{is often}} blamed as a {{significant}} source of greenhouse gases, owing to the erroneous belief that the methane released by livestock is in the flatus. While livestock account for around 20% of global methane emissions, 90–95% of that is released by exhaling or burping.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, diarrhea, nausea, <b>flatulence,</b> {{decreased}} appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing {{of the eyes}} or skin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of oxygen, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids; this {{gives rise to the}} odor of rotten eggs and contributes to the odor of <b>flatulence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{the causes}} of <b>flatulence</b> was spurred by high-altitude flight and manned spaceflight; the low {{atmospheric}} pressure, confined conditions, and stresses peculiar to those endeavours were cause for concern. In the field of mountaineering, the phenomenon of high altitude flatus expulsion was first recorded over two hundred years ago.|$|E
25|$|In many cultures, <b>flatulence</b> {{in public}} is {{regarded}} as embarrassing, but, depending on context, {{can also be considered}} humorous. People will often strain to hold in the passing of gas when in polite company, or position themselves to conceal the noise and scent. In other cultures, it may be no more embarrassing than coughing.|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{commonly}} reported {{adverse effects of}} taking misoprostol by mouth {{for the prevention of}} gastric ulcers are: abdominal pain, nausea, <b>flatulence,</b> headache, dyspepsia, vomiting, and constipation, but none of these adverse effects occurred more often than when taking placebos. In practice, fever is almost universal when multiple doses are given every 4 to 6 hours.|$|E
25|$|Common (1–10% of patients): blurred vision, diplopia, {{increased}} {{appetite and}} subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, abnormal coordination, memory impairment, tremors, dysarthria, parasthesia, vertigo, dry mouth and constipation, vomiting and <b>flatulence,</b> erectile dysfunction, fatigue, peripheral edema, feeling {{the effects of}} drunkenness, abnormal walking, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase level.|$|E
25|$|Flatulence-producing {{foods are}} {{typically}} high in certain polysaccharides, especially oligosaccharides such as inulin. Those foods include beans, lentils, dairy products, onions, garlic, spring onions, leeks, turnips, swedes, radishes, sweet potatoes, potatoes, cashews, Jerusalem artichokes, oats, wheat, and yeast in breads. Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables {{that belong to}} the genus Brassica are commonly reputed to not only increase <b>flatulence,</b> but to increase the pungency of the flatus.|$|E
25|$|Smell from <b>flatulence</b> is {{commonly}} treated with bismuth subgallate, available over-the-counter in the US as Devrom. Bismuth subgallate {{is commonly}} used by individuals who have had ostomy surgery, bariatric surgery, faecal incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome. Bismuth subsalicylate {{is a compound that}} binds H2S, and one study reported a dose of 524mg four times a day for 3–7 days bismuth subsalicylate yielded a >95% reduction in faecal H2S release in both humans and rats.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each <b>flatulence</b> event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first <b>flatulence</b> upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of <b>flatulence</b> caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|In {{people who}} have {{undergone}} gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and <b>flatulence.</b> Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when {{there is evidence of}} perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and use of a skin protectant.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ORS are unknown. It {{is thought that}} {{significant}} negative experiences may trigger the development of ORS. These have been considered as two types: key traumatic experiences related to smell, and life stressors present when the condition developed but which were unrelated to smell. In one review, 85% of reported cases had traumatic, smell-related experiences, and 17% of cases had stress factors unrelated to smell. Reported smell-related experiences usually revolve around family members, friends, co-workers, peers or other people making comments about an odor from the person, which causes embarrassment and shame. Examples include accusation of <b>flatulence</b> during a religious ceremony, or being bullied for <b>flatulence</b> such at school, accidental urination in class, announcements about a passenger needing to use deodorant over speaker by a driver on public transport, sinusitis which caused a bad taste in the mouth, mockery about a fish odor from a finger which had been inserted into the person's vagina {{in the context of}} a sexual assault, and revulsion about menarche and brother's sexual intimacy. It has been suggested that a proportion of such reported experiences may not have been real, but rather early symptom of ORS (i.e. referential thoughts). Examples of non smell-related stressful periods include guilt due to a romantic affair, being left by a partner, violence in school, family illness when growing up (e.g. cancer), and bullying.|$|E
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, <b>flatulence</b> {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E
