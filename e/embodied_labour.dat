"The Ricardians {{focus on}} <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> as the {{substance}} of value, {{to the neglect of}} the central question of the form of value, so obliterating the fundamental distinction between labour-time and value. The Rubin School, on the other hand, brings the form of value to the centre of the stage, but at the risk of losing sight of labour as {{the substance of}} value. For the Rubin School, the substance of value is not <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> but abstract labour. However to Rubin the amount of abstract labour embodied in a commodity cannot be defined independently of the exchange of commodities through which private labours are reduced to their common social substance. The only measure of abstract labour is correspondingly a monetary evaluation of the products of labour, expressed in their prices. The danger of Rubin's interpretation is that reference to labour as the substance of value is reduced to an empty rhetorical gesture in a theory which never manages to penetrate the appearances of exchange relations because it obliterates the distinction between value and exchange value." ...|$|E

50|$|But the {{production}} of any commodity generally requires both labour and some previously produced means of production (or capital goods), like tools and materials. The amount of labour so required is called the direct labour input into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the indirect labour input into the commodity. Putting together the direct and indirect labour inputs, one finally gets the total labour input into the commodity, which may also be called the total <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> in it, or its direct and indirect labour contents.|$|E

The model is estimated on a panel of 27, 754 firms observed from 1992 to 1995, using three estimations procedures: fixed-effect regression, random-effect GLS, and Hausman-Taylor estimation. Our findings show that, in traditional industries, labour productivity is mostly driven by embodied knowledge, whereas in high-tech industries, labour productivity depends on both embodied and disembodied knowledge. The latter result may be the consequence of the Industrial Upgrading Statute implemented in Taiwan after 1991.

50|$|The first {{advocates of}} {{socialism}} favoured social levelling {{in order to}} create a meritocratic or technocratic society based on individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism. Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and would be based on equal opportunities. He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism, and a belief that science was the key to progress. This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, and thus embodied a desire for a more directed or planned economy. Other early socialist thinkers, such as Thomas Hodgkin and Charles Hall, based their ideas on David Ricardo's economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> - the cost of the labour (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.|$|E

40|$|Three {{aggregate}} equalities {{have been}} discussed in the transformation problem in Marxian economics: total value =total price of production; total surplus value = total profit; total value product = total revenue.

40|$|Introduction In Part II of Capital, Volume III, Marx {{struggled}} {{to reconcile the}} labour theory of value with the proposition that an equalised rate of profit prevails [...] -as a general tendency [...] -across {{the economy as a}} whole. The problem was clear: if prices were proportional to <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> content, and if there was a common rate of surplus value across industries, then industries with a high organic composition of capital would show a low rate of profit, while industries with low organic composition of capital would show relatively high rates of profit. Students of the Marxian `transformation problem' differ widely on whether, or to what extent, Marx was successful in his attempted reconciliation. They also differ over whether, once equalised-profit prices (or prices of production) are given a correct analysis, any theoretical role remains for labour values (cf., Samuelson's `erase and replace' critique). Writers on this problem have, however, been virtually unanimous in holding t...|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} the conceptualization {{and analysis of}} aesthetic labour in two parts. The first part focuses on conceptualizing aesthetic labour. We critically revisit the emotional labour literature, arguing that the analysis of interactive service work is impeded by {{the way in which}} its corporeal aspects are retired and that, by shifting the focus from emotional to aesthetic labour, we are able to recuperate the embodied character of service work. We then explore the insights provided by the sociological perspectives on the body contained in the works of Goffman and Bourdieu in order to conceptualize aesthetic labour as <b>embodied</b> <b>labour.</b> In the second part, we develop our analysis of aesthetic labour {{within the context of a}} discussion of the aesthetics of organization. We discern three ways in which aesthetics is recognized to imbue organization: aesthetics of organization, aesthetics in organization and aesthetics as organization.

We ground this analysis in a case study from research conducted by the authors...|$|E
40|$|After showing {{different}} {{criteria for}} assessing economic theories {{and in general}} terms the growth of (economic) knowledge, the essentials of classical British economic theory (Political Economy) are outlined. Next the scientific career and {{the genesis of the}} works of Ricardo are dealt with. The building blocks of his theory are Malthus' law of population and his own theory of land rent. They serve as a basis for developing his original theory of income distribution among the three classes of society (landowners, tenants, agricultural workers). His vision is - like that of Adam Smith - a self-adjusting model of the economy. Getting at first rid of rent, his intention was to show that - in contrast to Smith - a decrease of profits is the result of an increase in wages. Rent is a price determined, but not a price determining factor. The decline of profits reduces capital accumulation and economic growth and ends up in a stationary state of the economy. The precondition of his analysis of income distribution was a theory of value. Ricardo selected the quantity of <b>embodied</b> <b>labour</b> as an invariable measure of value. From a political point of view Ricardo opposed state interventions, such as the corn laws and the poor laws. He had trust in a self-regulating economy, unlike his friend and critic Thomas Malthus...|$|E

As China’s social stratification deepens, new class identities are emerging, and class structures and class relations are being redefined (Li 2013). Consumption has also presented itself as key prism through which changing social structures in China in the reform era are understood. Real estate markets, for instance, provides a means of ‘spatializing class’ in urban China (L. Zhang 2010). Similarly, retail sector affords shoppers and sales people occasions to engage in strategies of class distinction (Hanser 2008). Class inequality can be experienced as <b>embodied</b> ‘interactive <b>labour</b> practices’ in the service and hospitality sector, whereby the bodies of workers function as ‘signs, codes and messages’ of class difference (Otis 2012 : 9). Class relations are equally embodied in the interactions between ‘intimate strangers’—employers versus domestic servants at home (Sun 2009) and patrons versus sex workers in the brothels.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{knowledge-based}} spillover {{theory of}} entrepreneurship (KSTE), entrepreneurship is {{positively associated with}} the knowledge endowment level. An increase in knowledge expands the opportunity set, which is then exploited by heterogeneous entrepreneurs. The objective {{of this paper is}} to empirically test the validity of the KSTE by employing a detailed database comprising more than 19 million observations for the period 2001 – 2008 at the level of individuals, firms and regions in Sweden. Knowledge is claimed to be partly <b>embodied</b> in <b>labour,</b> implying that an increase in labour mobility can be expected to influence knowledge endowment at the regional level. Our dependent variable is an individual who has remained in a region throughout the time period considered. Controlling for a number of other variables, inter-regional labour inflows and intra-regional mobility levels are shown to exert a strong positive effect on entrepreneurship. This contrasts with inter-regional outflows, which negatively affect entrepreneurial entry. Another noteworthy result is that the probability of exploiting an increased knowledge stock through entrepreneurship increases by 15  % points if the individual has previous experience in starting a firm.
