40|$|The use of micro-scale {{metallic}} pins {{in small}} engineering devices poses numerous problems {{due to their}} physical size and the dominant forces which act on micro-scale objects. Assembly of devices with micro-scale parts is problematic because the components are below the practical threshold of unaided human manipulation and most robotic manipulation. The use of tweezers and microscopes to aid human assembly is possible but challenging because the micro-scale pins tend to adhere to tweezers. Previous work has found that vibratory feeder-bowls provide a feasible means to singulate and orient micro-scale pins by overcoming the adhesive forces that plague other manipulation techniques. ^ The analysis and prediction {{of the behavior of}} vibratory feeder bowls for micro-scale components has previously been limited to two dimensions. To advance the understanding of vibratory feeder bowls for micro-pins, a three dimensional simulation has been developed that predicts the pin capture rates {{as a function of the}} physical properties of the <b>feeder</b> <b>bowl</b> and bodies. This model is based on an impulse-momentum contact model and it incorporates traditional macro-scale forces such as gravity, air-drag, and friction as well as micro-scale interactions such as magnetic and electrostatic forces.

50|$|Vibratory feeders, {{commonly}} known as a <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder,</b> are self-contained devices, consisting of a specially shaped bowl designed to orient the parts to a specific orientation. A vibrating drive unit, upon which the bowl is mounted and a variable-amplitude control box controls the <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder.</b> Usually included is an out feed accumulation track (linear or gravity) to convey parts along and discharge into the assembly machine comes in many shapes and sizes. The drive unit, available in both electromagnetic and pneumatic drives, vibrates the bowl, forcing the parts to move up a circular, inclined track. The tooling (hand made) is designed to sort and orient the parts in to a consistent, repeatable position. The track length, width, and depth are carefully chosen to suit each application, component shape and size. Special bowl and track coatings are applied according to shape size and material of the component which aids traction, damage to the product and lower acoustic levels.

40|$|The {{vibratory}} <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder</b> {{remains the}} most common approach to the automated feeding (orienting) of industrial parts. We study the algorithmic design of a trap in the <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder</b> track that filters out all but one orientation of a given polygonal part. We propose {{a new class of}} traps that we call guillotine traps, which remove a portion of the track between two parallel lines. A major advantage of guillotine traps over previously studied traps [1] is that they permit feeding the part in a user-specified stable orientation, whereas these other traps offered no control over the orientation to be fed. The capability of feeding a part in any priorly specified orientation for example offers the user a means of control over the feed rate. We present a complete algorithm that takes as input any polygonal part consisting of n vertices, along with its center of mass, and a desired output orientation of the part. Our algorithm computes a guillotine trap for a vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder</b> that outputs parts in the desired orientation, or reports that no such trap exists. The algorithm runs in O(nα(n) log n + nk), where α(n) is the extremely slowly growing inverse of the Ackermann function, and k is the number of candidate solutions. Although the value of k is trivially bounded by O(n), we conjecture that k is a small constant except for highly symmetric and regular parts. Surprisingly, our algorithm is considerably more efficient than the algorithm for the more restricted and hence less powerful gap trap, which was shown to run in O(n 2 log n) time [1].

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{previous}} work on the mechanics of vibratory conveying is given., It is found that several theoretical studies {{have been made in}} the past but the predictions of the theories and the comparisons of these' with experimental results have only been applicable to a very limited range of the relevant variables. In the present work, a theoretical analysis is described which enables the mean conveying velocity of a component on a conventional vibratory conveyor to be determined for'a wide range of the relevant variables. Since an alternative method of vibration is discussed, "conventional" refers' to vibratory conveyors which are commercially available. The results of this theory are compared with the results of experimental work conducted on apparatus specially designed for the purpose. Within practical limits, good agreement is obtained. From this work it is concluded that fundamental limitations eXist in conventional vibratory conveying, the most important of which are that the conveying velocity is very sensitive to changes in the coefficient of friction between the component and the track and for low coefficients of friction, the conveying velocity for steady conveying is inadequate. • A further analysis is then described which considers the mechanics of Vibratory conveying where a phase difference exists between the normal and parallel motions of the track, (known as "out of phase" conveying). Again, within certain limits, the new theory is in good agreement with experimental results. It is apparent from this work that with the correct phase relation$hip between the two components of vibration, definite practical advantages exist over conventional conveying. With "out of phase" conveying, the component velocity is virtually independent of the nature of the component and track materials and conveying velocities significantly higher than those obtainable on a conventional vibratory conveyor axe possible. Further, with this vibration system, components can be conveyed separately and without erratic motion up an inclined track. A practical method of obtaining an "out of phase" vibration on the track of a vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder</b> is suggested. The results of performance tests on two commercially available vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feeders</b> with conventional drives are presented and it is shown that in both cases their performance is very sensitive to changes in the bowl load.

These devices play an important operational role since feeding {{is one of the}} major operations involved in an automated assembly process. However they account for much of the cost of an automated assembly system because most of the engineering time spent to develop such a system is used to devise a means of feeding the components in the correct orientation for the assembly process. This thesis describes the implementation of an integrated and computer controlled feeding and transfer system. The system consists of a vibratory <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder</b> for selecting, orienting and feeding parts and a flat conveyor belt for transferring parts to a prescribed location. The work focusses mainly on the design and analysis of the <b>bowl</b> <b>feeder,</b> on the mechanical and information interfacing aspects of the integration problem and on the control of the system. Sensing and electronic control circuits were also built to complete the system. The system implemented is to be integrated at a later stage with an industrial robot for handling purposes. Therefore, some issues related to the handling of parts from the conveyor belt by the robot are also discussed. Experimental results show that the recommendable operating frequency for the vibratory feeder is close to the value predicted by theoretical analysis. Several concurrent activities with critical time constraints and different periods were involved in the system, making the control more difficult due to the limited control capabilities of Visual basic, an easy to learn programming language used to implement the control program and the relatively slow speed of the computer used Nevertheless, it was observed that for feed rates close to 3 parts/min, the program developed performs well regarding the random control of the flow rate of parts on the conveyor, parts position and speed profiles obtained compare satisfactorily with the corresponding theoretical profiles.
