40|$|The {{starting}} point for risk management and hedging lies in understanding a corporation’s exposure to different risks. Hedging is vital for corporate risk management, involving reducing the exposure of the company to particular risks.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{a change in}} accounting treatment for derivative instruments used to hedge firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures affects corporate risk-management and if so, which factors {{increase the likelihood that}} a change in accounting treatment will affect risk-management. I analyze a sample of firms that restated their financial statements due to the misclassification of economic hedges as accounting hedges, both of which are derivative instruments used to reduce firms 2 ̆ 7 market risk exposures and differ only in accounting treatment. Economic hedges are accounted for under fair value accounting whereas accounting hedges receive hedge accounting treatment, the preferred method because it avoids the increase in earnings volatility associated with fair value accounting. ^ I first examine why certain firms use hedge accounting treatment following the restatement and other firms do not. I find that the type of hedging instrument used, the market risk that was being hedged, and the disclosed reason for the restatement affect the likelihood that firms will apply hedge accounting following the restatement. Firms that do not use hedge accounting following the restatement face a trade-off between continuing the <b>economic</b> <b>hedge</b> which increases earnings volatility, and discontinuing the hedge which avoids the increase in earnings volatility but increases market risk exposure. I find that dividends, tax benefits and firms 2 ̆ 7 historic patterns of reporting positive earnings are associated with the likelihood that firms discontinue economic hedges, increasing market risk exposure. I also find that leverage, growth, distress and analyst following are associated with the likelihood that firms continue economic hedges, maintaining market risk exposure but increasing earnings volatility. This study provides an example of how a change in accounting treatment affects firm behavior and results of this study contribute to our understanding of firm characteristics which influence managers to focus on accounting earnings versus market risk exposure. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2005, {{all groups}} listed on European stock exchanges are {{required}} to prepare their consolidated financial statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS are different from local regulations across Europe in many aspects, and observers expect the transition process thorny and resource-draining for the companies that undertake it. The study explores transition difficulties by Swedish bank groups on the way of implementing IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Deemed the most controversial and challenging standard for adoption by the financial sector, it indeed poses new demandson classification, recognition and measurment of financial instruments, and sets out new hedge accounting rules, previously unseen in Swedish practice. Additionaly, the structure of bank's balance sheets makes IAS 39 also the central one among all other standards in terms of numbers of balance sheet items it impacts. The study uses qualitative method to explore whether transition to IAS 39 is likely to improve transparency in reporting derivatives. Focus is on use of interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in mitigation of interest rate risk. It is concluded that differences between two reporting frameworks have been well understood by the banks early in the implementation process. A negative feature of the standard is increased volatility in earnings {{as a result of}} more wide-spread reliance on fair value measurement method. This accounting volatility impedes comparability of performance results, as well as conceals true efficiency of <b>economic</b> <b>hedge</b> relationships. To some degree, the volatility can be minimized by the application of hedge accounting. However, a bank must methodically follow a set of rigourous if hegde accounting is to be adopted. Fair value is a more straightforward alternative to hedge accounting, but it brings in additional concerns, and has not yet been endorsed in the EU. It is additionally argued that recognition of all derivatives on BS and measurement at fair value are two important features of IAS 39 that indeed increases reporting transparency by minimizing risk of undisclosed hidden losses...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} encompasses four {{essays on}} various topics {{within the field}} of finance. Chapter 1 presents an overview of the contributions of each essay. Chapter 2, titled Risk Aversion, Price Uncertainty, and Irreversible Investments, extends the theory of irreversible investment under uncertainty by allowing for risk averse instead of risk neutral investors in an incomplete markets setting. Chapter 3, titled <b>Economic</b> <b>Hedging</b> Portfolios, studies portfolios that investors hold to <b>hedge</b> <b>economic</b> risks. Using a model of state-dependent utility, it provides a generalization of the traditional mean-variance model. In Chapter 4, titled Multivariate Option Pricing Using Dynamic Copula Models, the price behavior of derivatives written on multiple underlying assets is examined. The association between the underlying assets is modeled using parametric families of copulas which offer various alternatives to the commonly assumed normal dependence structure. Chapter 5, titled An Anatomy of Futures Returns: Risk Premiums and Trading Strategies, provides an empirical analysis of trading strategies which capture the various risk premiums that have been distinguished in futures markets. Sorting strategies designed to exploit the information in the term structure of futures yields and past hedging pressure are found to yield expected returns that cannot be explained by equity, bond, and currency benchmarks. ...|$|R

But the uncertainty that determines the variance risk premium –the fear by investors to deviations from Normality in returns- is also strongly related to a variety of risks: risk of default, employment growth risk, consumption growth risk, stock market risk and market illiquidity risk. Therefore, the variance risk premium could be interpreted as reflecting the market willingness to pay for hedging against financial and macroeconomic sources of risk.

40|$|This paper aims {{to bridge}} the gap between theory and facts on the {{so-called}} 'Minsky moments' by revisiting the financial instability hypothesis (FIH). We limit the analysis to the core of the FIH, that is, to its strictly financial part. The approach suggested here builds on Minsky's contributions revisited in the light of the subprime mortgage financial crisis. We start from a constructive criticism of the well-known Minskyan taxonomy of <b>economic</b> units (<b>hedge,</b> speculative, and Ponzi), and suggest a different approach that allows a continuous measure of the units' financial conditions. We use this alternative approach to account for the cyclical fluctuations of financial conditions that endogenously generate instability and fragility. We may thus suggest a precise definition of a Minsky moment as the starting point of a Minsky process, the phase of a financial cycle when many economic units suffer from both liquidity and solvency problems. Although the approach sketched here is very simple and requires extensions in many directions, we may draw from it a few policy insights on how to mitigate the financial cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|If {{the input}} or selling {{price of a}} {{commodity}} changes in a negative manner the effect on business profits and investment worth can be disastrous. The risk of this occurring is defined as "price risk". Price risk is inherent in New Zealand forestry markets. Futures markets trade contracts with standardized specifications for the purchase or sale of commodities, or fmancial instruments, at predetermined delivery dates in the future, at prices agreed upon when the contract is entered.

The commodity and market characteristics of the New Zealand forestry industry are then defmed, and using all this information, the feasibility and likelihood of success of a futures market for the New Zealand forestry industry is then determined.

This evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of inflation hedging of Taiwan's housing during the period of study and the opportunistic characteristic of investors.
