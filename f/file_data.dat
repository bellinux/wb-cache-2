5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and <b>file</b> <b>data.</b> Metadata and <b>file</b> <b>data</b> are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E

Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the spool file to the page description language supported by the printer.|$|E

500|$|Built-in resilience: ReFS employs an allocation-on-write update {{strategy}} for metadata, [...] which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large IO batches. All ReFS metadata has built-in 64-bit checksums which are stored independently. The <b>file</b> <b>data</b> {{can have an}} optional checksum in a separate [...] "integrity stream", {{in which case the}} file update strategy also implements allocation-on-write; this is controlled by a new [...] "integrity" [...] attribute applicable to both files and directories. If nevertheless <b>file</b> <b>data</b> or metadata becomes corrupt, the file can be deleted without taking the whole volume offline. As a result of built-in resiliency, administrators do not need to periodically run error-checking tools such as CHKDSK when using ReFS.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the {{intensity}} of the output on TV and computer display devices is not directly proportional to the R, G, and B applied electric signals (or <b>file</b> <b>data</b> values which drive them through Digital-to-Analog Converters). On a typical standard 2.2-gamma CRT display, an input intensity RGB value of (0.5,0.5,0.5) only outputs about 22% of full brightness (1.0,1.0,1.0), instead of 50%. To obtain the correct response, a gamma correction is used in encoding the image data, and possibly further corrections as part of the color calibration process of the device. Gamma affects black-and-white TV as well as color. In standard color TV, broadcast signals are [...] gamma corrected.|$|E

40|$|Indirect blocks, {{part of a}} file’s {{metadata}} {{used for}} locating this <b>file’s</b> <b>data</b> blocks, are typically treated indistinguishably from <b>file’s</b> <b>data</b> blocks in buffer cache. This paper shows that this conventional approach will significantly detriment the overall energy efficiency of memory systems. Scatter-ing small but frequently accessed indirected blocks over all memory chips reduce the energy saving opportunities. We propose a new energy-efficient buffer cache management scheme, named MEEP, which separates indirect and data blocks into different memory chips. Our trace-driven simu-lation results show that our new scheme can save memory energy up to 16. 8 % and 15. 4 % in the I/O-intensive server workloads TPC-R and TPC-H, respectively. ...|$|R
