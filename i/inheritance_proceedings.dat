40|$|<b>Inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> The goal of my Master's {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} in detail {{the course of the}} <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Even though, the overall rule states that inheritance is assumed at the moment of decedent's death, the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> must take place. It is therefore a procedure set by law that is presided by a notary as a court commissar who is authorized by a competent court. During the proceedings, the notary locates decedent's inheritors, his assets and debts. With conclusion of the proceedings, all decedent's property relations are assorted in order. Simply it can be said, the conclusion of the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> is a division of decedent's assets and debts among all heirs. This thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter describes the history of the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> and the position of a notary as a court commissar in the period in between the First Republic to the contemporary practice. Furthermore, the contemporary inheritance proceeding is characterized as well as its function and legal framework, including its demarcation as a non-adversarial process.

40|$|A notary in <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> The aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} the activity of the notary as a court commissioner in <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> and to compare Czech and Slovak legislation on this issue. In our legislation the inheritance proceeding is mandatory, as well as court commissariat, which means that when the court learns of the death of the person promptly starts the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> and instructs the court commissioner with the acts in proceedings. Court commissioner has de facto the control of the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> in his hands and with small exceptions he makes all acts in the proceeding.

40|$|The {{legislation}} governing {{rights of}} inheritance {{is based on}} the principle that an inheritance is received upon the death of the testator. However, before assets which form the subject of the inheritance are received by the heirs, <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> take place before the courts, the result of which is a resolution which confirms receipt of the inheritance by the heirs. Until this resolution is legally passed all heirs who are to receive an inheritance are co-owners of the entire inheritance.

The matters of inheritance procedures with real property being their subjects and issues connected with the subsequent ownership acquisition of such property are discussed separately. The part of the problem also concerns inheritance tax (succession, death duty). The practical part concentrates on two individual examples from legal practice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my final thesis "Matrimonial {{property}} {{in the context of}} inheritance proceedings" is to analyse law dealings with settlements of matrimonial property and its application in <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings.</b> I emphasize problems caused by a lack of interconnection between the legislation of matrimonial property and the law of succession where I focus on both the substantial as well as procedural law. Furthermore, I discuss a tension between two principles - free will and protection of a surviving spouse - which emerges during the settlements of matrimonial {{property in the}} <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> and which is apparent from the amount of rights given to the surviving spouse under the law of succession. Additionally, I compare the Czech legislation in this matter to the English law, even though England belongs to different legal culture where the concept of matrimonial property has not been fully introduced yet. However, considering the need for adjusting the Czech legislation of matrimonial property to the law of succession, I suggest that the protection which is given to the surviving spouse under English law might be inspiring for the Czech legislator...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{describe}} land administration in Kosovo and its challenges in form of deficiencies regarding the cadastre and the importance of having a trustworthy system. The lands history, culture and legal framework all work together in making the register of property that is today. Kosovo is a part of an ongoing transformation as a country, and undergoing political, cultural and social changes. Much have been done in a short amount of time, and have had and are having struggles along the way. Building up a new state with laws, regulations and institutions that had to be rebuild after the war. This thesis specifies to a degree on inheritance, but because Kosovo is facing several major deficiencies in the cadastre due to its history and culture, I saw it as important to illustrate these too. Findings from my research questions briefed up: 1. What are the most significant deficiencies in the cadaster in Kosovo? - Evidence suggest that 40 % of properties remain registered in the name of the deceased, and 30 % of applicants that try to formalize their rights are not able to do so because their families did not initiate <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and the property is registered in the name of the deceased. Many families choose not to go through with <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> because they already feel that their property rights are secure without having the formal title. They do not see or know the benefits of a having a formal title. Economy also plays a role her. - Graphic and written cadastral documents that was registered in the period 1983 to 1999 are missing in all municipalities in Kosovo. These documents were confiscated by Serbian employees during the war in 1999. Kosovo is therefore missing a significant amount of cadastre information. - Kosovos status as an autonomous province was lifted in 1989, and following was a 10 -year period of ethnic discrimination. Property transactions between and to Kosovo Albanians was made illegal in the period between 1989 and 1999. A consequence of this was that the cadastral records remained incomplete and inaccurate because the contracts were done verbally and not registered. - A study concerning informal buildings in Kosovo (Potsiou 2016) estimated that more than 90 % of the new buildings that are sold are based on mutual trust; without a permit and/or title. The lack of property permits and ownership titles does not affect the market value, because the buyers are used to it being like this because they do not have other available options or are not well informed of the risk. 2. What challenges does deficiencies in the cadastre information entail?  - The biggest challenge is the lack of a trustworthy register of property. The register should work as a guarantee of ownership, but when it is estimated that 40 % of the registered properties are not in the names of the right owners the trust to the cadastre minimizes. - Immovable properties registered under the name of deceased persons is an issue the property tax authorities are currently facing. Property tax is important for the municipalities to increase the own-source income. 3. How do the municipalities deal with the deficiencies?  - The municipalities cannot do much more than guide the users. The deficiencies cannot be corrected before the correct documentation is sent in. They try to encourage people to finalize the <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and inform of the importance of this...|$|E

The first is an intestate succession and the alternative is constituted by a testate succession.

In fact legal heirs succeed if a deceased doesn't leave any testament. The exception is represented by forced heirs. The legal grounds to the testamentary succession there is a testament, sometimes called a will of deceased, too.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{an issue}} {{central to the}} economic and political development of the early United States: laws protecting real property from the claims of creditors. Traditional English law, protecting inheritance, shielded a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s land from the reach of creditors in two respects. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s freehold interest in land was exempted from the claims of unsecured creditors both during life and in <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings.</b> In addition, even when land had been explicitly pledged as collateral in mortgage agreements, chancery court procedures imposed substantial costs on creditors using legal process to seize the land. American property law, however, emerged in the context of colonialism and the dynamics of the Atlantic economy. In 1732, to advance the economic interests of English merchants, Parliament enacted a sweeping statute, the Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts in His Majesty 2 ̆ 7 s Plantations and Colonies in America, which required that real property, houses, and slaves be treated as legally equivalent to chattel property for the purpose of satisfying debts in all of the British colonies in America and the West Indies. This statute substantially dismantled the legal framework of the English inheritance system by giving unsecured creditors priority to a deceased 2 ̆ 7 s land over heirs. The Act also required that the courts hold auctions to sell both slaves and real property to satisfy debts in most colonies. More broadly, this legal transformation likely led to greater commodification of real property, the expansion of slavery, and more capital for economic development. American landholders, however, were subjected to greater financial risk than would have been the case {{in the absence of the}} Act. The Act for the More Easy Recovery of Debts was reenacted by most, but not all, state legislatures in the founding era. One legacy of the colonial era was that, through the 1840 s, most states exempted only minimal amounts of property from creditors 2 ̆ 7 claims. Tensions relating to creditors 2 ̆ 7 remedies, both between the states and the federal government and between states with differing policies, had important consequences for American federalism. The history of creditors 2 ̆ 7 claims to real property in the colonial and founding periods is important to understanding the emergence of an American property law, the economic development of the colonies and states, the expansion of slavery, and American federalism...|$|E
40|$|U članku se razmatra na koji su način šire društvene, gospodarske i pravne promjene utjecale na seljačku obitelj. MoguÊnost primjene odredbi građanskog zakona, prema kojima žena ima pravo nasljeđivati zemlju, te pojačana gospodarska uloga žena (kao radne snage, ali i kao člana koji ima vlastite izvore prihoda kroz “žensku” trgovinu, a katkad i veće sposobnosti od muža za trgovinu i zastupanje obitelji u javnim poslovima) ojačavala je status žene, iako se to još u mentalitetu ili javnom iskazivanju nije pokazivalo. The article {{describes}} {{the manner in which}} general social, economic and legal changes influenced farm families. The possibility of application of the civil law, according to which a woman had the right to inherit land, as well as the increasingly strong role of women (as labour force, but also as family members with their own sources of income through the “women’s” trade, and sometimes due to their better capacities than their husbands’ for trade and representing of family in public affairs) reinforced the status of women, although it was not shown yet in the mentality or expressed in public. As was the case in other counties, the common law of inheritance was being abandoned slowly and with hardships. When determining a farmland heir, between the two wars, two principles were applied: the principle stemming from the traditional communal household law, and the new civil-law principle. According to the first principle, direct male heirs inherited land (patrilinear principle), and the older generation did {{not have the right to}} decide on the issue; and according to the other one, owner of the land had the right to decide on the heirs (limited only by the right to a necessary portion). These two opposing legal principles in reality enabled one to find various solutions, suitable to one’s economic capabilities and personal attitude. Wherever possible, the rule that the land was to be left to sons, and daughters were given only the traditional dowry, was still being respected. But, the legal right resulted in the increasingly frequent position that land was a part of dowry. If a daughter could not get her piece of land, it was considered that she was entitled to a buy-out, if necessary in deferred payment. Unless bought out in any form, a daughter could claim her share in <b>inheritance</b> <b>proceedings</b> after the parent’s death. To avoid this, after the dowry was agreed on, a daughter was requested to renounce any further heritage claims. Inheriting by women worsened the already great fragmentation of land, due to which not all sons could get their part. Women’s right to get a piece of land on one side, and insufficiently large farms, from which they should get a share, on the other, led to increased “bargaining” between parents and the families the girls married into, where the discussions were always dominated by men. Although women could not decide on the land issues, as they did not own it, the land meant prestige and a better status in their husbands’ families. The change in the status of women can be observed from the distribution of work according to the sexes. In reduced families, traditional distribution could not be kept as strict as earlier. Nevertheless, women were taking on men’s duties much more often than the other way round, especially in the incomplete families. Unequal possibility of another marriage, which in case of women almost did not exist, contributed to this fact. In small families, women were able to stand out owing to their abilities, and become heads of families. Status of women was based primarily on their economic role (irreplaceable labour force, her own sources of income through “women’s” trade), and also on the increasing possibility that they would inherit land (the main capital one lives on). Although the families, in which women played the leading role, were becoming more numerous, the traditional patriarchal understanding of women’s role and duties did not change significantly...|$|E
