Lunar <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> {{the vertical}} include directional information of the Moon’s gravity field. SGM 90 d, recovered from SELENE mission, revealed the lunar far side gravity {{field for the}} first time in history owes to 4 -way Doppler data. Lunar <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the vertical and their meridional and prime vertical components are calculated from SGM 90 d, and then their global distributions are also given in the paper. The <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> lunar <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the vertical are defined and computed as well. The correlations between the lunar <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the vertical and the lunar terrain have been fully discussed. Many different characteristics <b>of</b> lunar <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> vertical have been found between the near side and the far side of the Moon, which may be caused from the lithospheric compensation and the uplifting of mantle...|$|R
30|$|Kirchhoff’s theory {{consists}} of a single-variable model in which in-plane displacements are expressed in terms <b>of</b> <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>deflection</b> w 0 (x, y) from the assumption of zero transverse shear strains. Solution for w 0 is such that zero face shear conditions and edge support conditions are satisfied. It is governed by a fourth-order equation associated with two edge conditions instead of three edge conditions required in a 3 -D problem. A consequence of this lacuna is the well-known Poisson-Kirchhoff boundary conditions paradox unresolved satisfactorily over the past 16 decades.|$|R

40|$|All  quantities,  which are  measured  in  the  gravity  field  of  the  Earth are {{affected}} by  the  field,  therefore,  there should  be correlations  amongst  them.   Here,  we  focus  on  some  gravimetrically-determined  quantities  like  deflections  of  vertical, <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> Moho, vertical-horizontal gravity gradients and the shear sub-lithospheric stress components due to mantle convection. We show that how these quantities {{are related to}} each other mathematically so that one of them can be written in term of another. This somehow proves the presence of the mentioned correlations theoretically. Also, we generate the maps of these quantities over the Indo-Pak and surrounding areas and show how similar they are. Thereafter, they are explained and  interpreted  geologically.   Our  investigations  show  that  the  maps  of  these  quantities  are  in  good  agreements  with topographic and geological features. The map of the vertical-horizontal gravity gradients shows more detailed information of the  gravity field due to  signal amplification at high  degrees,  that <b>of</b> Moho <b>deflection</b> shows sub-surface features due to reduction of the effect of topographic masses. The map of the shear sub-lithospheric stress components is much smoother than the gradients, as expected, and has good agreement with the collisional and subduction zones as well.   Relationship amongst gravity <b>gradients,</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> vertical, Moho <b>deflection</b> and the stresses derived by mantle convections-a case study over Indo-Pak and surroundings.

40|$|Behaviour of a sessile droplet on a {{vibrating}} {{elastic plate}} is investigated. We obtain experimentally {{the characteristics of}} droplet oscillation modes by two high speed cameras recording from side view and top view synchronously. Theoretical shapes and frequencies are compared with those measured in the experiments, and different regimes of the droplet oscillations are explained. Moreover, the circular patterns of the elastic plate oscillations, so-called “Chladni patterns”, were visualized. The radius variations of the nodal lines in the plate with {{the frequency of the}} external forcing are well predicted by our theoretical model. We further focus on the influence of the non-uniform amplitude of the plate oscillation on the droplet oscillatory behaviour. It is important to notice that a drop placed at a nodal line oscillates due to the pitch motion of the plate at this line but not due to the plate vertical vibration which is negligible at the nodal line. A droplet located either outside or inside the nodal lines behaves very differently, resulting in potential depinning of the contact line due to the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> the plate <b>deflection...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the 20 th century, a {{large amount}} of torsion balance mea-surements have been carried out around the world. The mea-surements still provide a good {{opportunity}} to detect the lat-eral underground mass inhomogeneities and the geological fault structures using the so called edge effects in gravity gradi-ents. Hitherto almost 60000 torsion balance measurements were made in Hungary mainly for geophysical purposes. Only the horizontal gradients were used for geophysical prospecting, the curvature gradients measured by torsion balance remained un-used. However, curvature gradients are very useful data in geodesy, using these <b>gradients</b> precise <b>deflections</b> <b>of</b> the verti-cal can be calculated by interpolation and using astrogeodetic determination of the geoid the fine structure of the geoid can be derived. In our test area a geoid with few centimeters accu-racy was determined based on the curvature data. Based on the horizontal and the curvature <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> gravity the full Eötvös tensor (including the vertical gradients) can be derived by the 3 D inversion method. In our earlier research works additional new torsion balance measurements were necessary. Applying the new technical opportunities we reconstructed and modern-ized our older instruments, and additional torsion balance mea-surements have been made to study the linearity of gravity gra-dients.

40|$|This study {{examined}} allometric patterns and architectural features of Copaifera langsdorffii, in different physiognomies {{in a region}} of ecological tension. The forest, corridor, 'cerrado', and rocky cerrado physiognomies were studied in the districts of Lavras and Carrancas, south of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The relationships between stem diameter, height, crown area, degrees <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> and relative displacement were analyzed, {{as well as the}} degree of similarity between the physiognomies by means of regressions and covariance analysis. The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the collected biometric and calculated morphometric variables to characterize the most homogeneous groups which show the morphological plasticity of the species and their different strategies and resources investment. As a result of the regression and covariance analysis, two distinct patterns were found mainly between forest and ¿cerrado¿ physiognomies from rocky cerrado and corridor physiognomies. It was found a pattern of growth through higher investment in height in the forest, aiming to guarantee space in the canopy, and a more connected to the horizontal growth of the crown, in the rocky 'cerrado' and corridor. The PCA showed a <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> morphological plasticity for the species. The forest physiognomy presented higher values of total height, crown width and stem diameter, while the rocky 'cerrado' physiognomy presented higher degrees <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the crown (asymmetry). The 'cerrado' and the corridor formed a transition between forest and rocky ´cerrado´ for the <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> morphological features of the studied species in these physiognomies...|$|R
