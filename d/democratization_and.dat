The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of <b>democratization</b> <b>and</b> modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved.

A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further <b>democratization</b> <b>and</b> decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E

He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified <b>democratization</b> <b>and</b> free trade, to significantly {{improve the quality of life}} for Africans.

This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of <b>democratization</b> <b>and</b> political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region.

Belgian policies wavered and flip-flopped considerably during this period leading up to independence of Burundi and Rwanda.|$|E

It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia.

25|$|Pre-colonization {{education}} systems in Comoros focused on necessary {{skills such as}} agriculture, caring for livestock and completing household tasks. Religious education also taught children the virtues of Islam. The education system underwent a transformation during colonization in the early 1900s which brought secular education based on the French system. This was mainly for children of the elite. After Comoros gained independence in 1975, the education system changed again. Funding for teachers' salaries was lost, and many went on strike. Thus, the public education system was not functioning between 1997 and 2001. Since gaining independence, the education system has also undergone a <b>democratization</b> <b>and</b> options exist for those other than the elite. Enrollment has also grown.|$|E
