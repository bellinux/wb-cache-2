25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> point your thumb when determining its handedness.|$|E

When one comes to an intersection, only arrows leading from the road you are on to another road can be followed. One must continue in this fashion, following the arrows at the intersection, until the end is reached. When you come to an intersection from one <b>direction,</b> <b>you</b> have different options for which road to take than you would coming into the intersection from another direction; therefore, this {{can be defined as}} a [...] "multi-state" [...] or [...] "logic" [...] maze.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong <b>direction.</b> <b>You</b> trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E

"Disregarding this, we {{say that}} the earth on all its sides is the same; all people on the earth stand upright, and all heavy things fall down to the earth by a law of nature, {{for it is the}} nature of the earth to attract and to keep things, as it is the nature of water to flow, that of fire to burn, and that of the wind to set in motion.

2500|$|Corry was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of Irish republicanism, strongly opposed to Partition, antipathetic to the United Kingdom, and sometimes bluntly outspoken within the Dáil chamber. In 1928, he criticised the Cumann na nGaedheal government's expenditure on the diplomatic corps, stating [...] "These salaries of £1,500 {{have to be}} paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and said he was an English gentleman." [...] His opposition to the Blueshirts in the early 1930s provoked an attempt to burn down his house. In the 1938 debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement which ceded the Treaty Ports to the Irish state, Corry expressed regret that Northern Ireland remained excluded, suggesting [...] "I personally am in favour of storing up sufficient poison gas, so that when you get the wind in the right <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> can start at the Border and let it travel, and follow it." [...] In a 1942 debate on exporting food to Great Britain during World War II, Corry remarked about food shortages there that [...] "They have no more rabbits to get, and now they are on the crows", and [...] "I would not like to see too many crows going out to feed them. I think the crows are too good for them". Patrick Giles called Corry a [...] "", and Alfie Byrne persisted in demanding an apology for the [...] "unchristian" [...] comments to the point of himself being suspended from the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Yoakum {{reportedly}} had {{his followers}} distribute nickels to indigents on skid row, a sum {{that would permit}} them to ride the train to the station near Pisgah Home. [...] As the crowds of [...] "down and outs" [...] continued to come to Pisgah Home, the movement drew the enmity of neighbors. [...] And indeed, Yoakum's flock {{was the source of}} some crime in the area. [...] In 1912, two of the [...] "inmates" [...] from Pisgah Home were arrested for the attempted robbery of a safe at a nearby business. [...] In 1913, Halstead [...] "Billy" [...] Stiles, claiming to be a reformed gunslinger who was part of the James-Younger Gang when it attempted the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery, moved into the Pisgah Home. [...] Stiles' story was published in the Pisgah publication (with a reported circulation of 100,000), in which he wrote: [...] "My soul was black with many a crime, but he Lord took me and washed me as white as wool. [...] I was not reformed, but transformed." [...] Later still, a large crowd assembled when boxing champion and accused murderer Kid McCoy (the man for whom the expression the [...] "real McCoy" [...] was coined) came to Pisgah Home [...] "under heavy guard" [...] to visit his mother, a resident. [...] Other problems included elderly inmates wandering off in a [...] "dazed condition" [...] from the home. [...] The Highland Park News-Herald reported in the late 1910s about the parade of people flowing to Pisgah Home:"It may be that some Sunday afternoon has found you in a spirit of criticism or pity for these poor deluded people ... From every <b>direction</b> <b>you</b> see them coming—in wheel-chairs, on crutches, stumbling in blindness, tottering with age, bent with burdens, painted with sin, stamped with greed ..." [...] Complaints from his Highland Park neighbors were reportedly among the reasons for Yoakum's development of the remote Pisgah Grande community in the Santa Susana Mountains.|$|E
