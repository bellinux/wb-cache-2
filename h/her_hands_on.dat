5|$|The Divas match set for Vengeance {{was between}} Victoria and Christy Hemme. On the May 30 edition of Raw, Christy Hemme won a bikini contest; {{defeating}} Victoria, Candice Michelle, Maria, and Lilian Garcia. After the contest ended, Victoria {{turned into a}} villainess by attacking all of the participants, saving Hemme for last. In a backstage interview following her heel turn, the evil Victoria expressed jealousy of Hemme, stating that {{she was tired of}} Hemme getting all of the attention. On the June 20 episode of Raw, it was announced in a backstage interview that Hemme and Victoria would face each other at Vengeance. Hemme stated that she couldn't wait to get <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Victoria, but during the segment, Victoria interrupted the interview by smashing a glass jar on the back of Hemme's head.|$|E
5|$|In March, Melina {{was placed}} in an angle where she became jealous of SmackDown! Diva Ashley Massaro, who was {{receiving}} attention because of her appearance in Playboy. The angle had Melina claim in her blogs that no Playboy cover models were capable of fighting her. This resulted in scheduled matches against former Playboy cover girls Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle, with both women losing to Melina. The storyline {{came to an end}} at WrestleMania 23, where Melina pinned Ashley in a Lumberjill match to retain her Women's Championship. After WrestleMania, Melina organized a photo op with the Women's Championship belt in the ring, but was interrupted by Mickie James, resulting in another storyline feud between the two Divas. On April 24, at a house show in Paris, France, Melina lost the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match to James when James pinned Victoria, but on the orders of Jonathan Coachman, she was entitled to a rematch on the same night, where she pinned James by putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the ropes to regain the title and become a two-time WWE Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E

25|$|Sculptures of Epona {{fall into}} five types, as {{distinguished}} by Benoît: riding, standing or seated before a horse, standing or seated between two horses, a tamer of {{horses in the}} manner of potnia theron and the symbolic mare and foal. In the Equestrian type, common in Gaul, she is depicted sitting side-saddle on a horse or (rarely) lying on one; in the Imperial type (more common outside Gaul) she sits on a throne flanked by two or more horses or foals. In distant Dacia, she is represented on a stela (now at the Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest) in the format of Cybele, seated frontally on a throne with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the necks of her paired animals: her horses are substitutions for Cybele's lions.|$|E
25|$|Later, Lawrence Alamain {{comes to}} town. Jennifer {{believes}} that Lawrence thinks she is Katerina, the heiress to the Von Leuschner fortune, {{due to a}} confusion going back to when the real heiress (Carly Manning) and Jennifer were teenagers and they had switched dates. After a hurried wedding, Lawrence rapes Jennifer, admitting that he knew her real identity all along. Jack arrives to rescue Jennifer. Jack and Jennifer became engaged, but he calls off the wedding because he feels alienated from her. Jennifer is still unable to handle intimacy and is too ashamed to tell Jack that Lawrence raped her. Jack then marries Eve to help her get <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her $10 million inheritance. After Jennifer finally tells Jack the truth, she presses rape charges against Lawrence. Kimberly and Jack are able to record him confessing to the rape, and Lawrence is then sent to jail. Eve reluctantly grants Jack a divorce, and Jack and Jennifer are married. Soon after, a swindler named Hawk soon cheats {{them out of their}} money. He is caught, but the couple remains penniless. Jennifer then learns she is pregnant, but Jack's joy is not great. He thinks he is suffering a relapse of Hodgkin's disease. Though he is not ill, Jennifer goes to New York to do a TV show with Calliope. Jennifer gives birth later that year to a daughter, Abigail Johanna.|$|E

In late 1981 Sarah Horton is born, and after a custody battle with Evan Whyland, Mickey and Maggie win custody of Sarah. In 1982, Melissa Anderson runs away from her private school, unable {{to deal with her}} trouble-making mother, Linda who wanted her back in order to get <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Anderson manufacturing, and Melissa ends up in Mickey and Maggie's home.

500|$|To Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone, {{the track}} was [...] "a {{compelling}} gospel-flavored rocker... a stunning achievement {{that carries the}} authority of pop scripture". On an album that he considered [...] "a pop religious ceremony for all seasons, one in which Harrison acts as priest, deliberately placing his gifts and his legend into public service for God", Holden added of the song: [...] "I hope that Aretha Franklin gets <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it, and soon." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, a {{director}} {{cut of the}} video leaked onto the Internet. It shows heavier scenes, like wounded and maimed soldiers, war scenes, images of poverty and death. In 2010, Slant Magazine placed this alternate video on the nineteenth place of decade's fifty best music videos list, stating: [...] "It isn't like either the video's message about viewing war {{as a form of}} popular entertainment or its striking, loaded images leave much room for misinterpretation. Prescient? Yes. Relevant? Surely. Subtle? Not so much." [...] This version of the video ends with the tossed grenade landing on the catwalk and Madonna putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her ears.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the [...] "Marlinspike Prize Band" [...] (Harmonie de Moulinsart {{in the original}} French version), {{was based on a}} similar experience of Hergé's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to [...] "Spirou", the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of [...] "L'Orpheon France" [...] band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels her stolen, her expressions, which involve placing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), which was also one of Hergé's favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, {{during a}} storyline that saw Victoria and her {{siblings}} sue their father {{for control of}} a cosmetics line, Bibel wrote: [...] "Victoria, whose true motivation was to get <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Beauty of Nature so she could become its CEO, got a rude awakening when Nick told her {{in no uncertain terms}} that he had no interest in trading the settlement money for the company. I think the second stage of the battle will be the Newman siblings squabbling over the money a la King Lear, assuming the show actually allows Victor to lose {{for more than a few}} episodes." [...] Soon after, Bibel said that Victoria had been [...] "whiny" [...] and found the character's mother Nikki's storyline [...] "far more interesting". That same year, Giddens wrote that a blogger from The Washington Post compared Victoria to Rupert Murdoch, saying: [...] " [...] partial nod must go to the soap opera The Young and the Restless, whose character Victoria Newman was arrested on her wedding day for allegedly bribing a foreign dignitary. Television and Murdoch and ’round-the-clock FCPA conjectureit’s a welcome publicity storm for the FCPA bar." ...|$|E
500|$|Apollonia and Sofie Agnesh Bojakshiya are fortunetellers in a mother-daughter act at the carnival. Although Apollonia is catatonic, she and Sofie can {{communicate}} telepathically. Their original biographies declare Apollonia a [...] "once renowned seer who read cards {{for the rich}} and famous" [...] and [...] "the only psychic Houdini was unable to debunk." [...] A series of seizures during Sofie's birth in 1913 was given as reason for Apollonia's state. Apollonia's sister cared for her until Sofie was old enough to take over, and they began working the traveling circuits shortly afterwards. It remains unknown until late in season 2 that Sofie is the Omega, although the character's importance for the show's mythology is suggested much earlier. When the series starts with Ben joining the carnival, Apollonia can no longer shield Sofie from her own true self. Sofie begins to evade and rebel against her mother's mental control, but Apollonia counters by first trying to drive Sofie to suicide, then by attempting to kill her in a trailer fire {{at the end of the}} first season. Jonesy rescues Sofie, but Apollonia dies. Nevertheless, season 2 shows Apollonia repeatedly appearing to Sofie and snake charmer Ruthie. Sofie tries to leave her fortuneteller life behind by becoming a roustabout. After a short-lived relationship with Ben, Sofie leaves the carnival altogether and becomes the Crowes' maid in California. Brother Justin introduces her to the world of religion, but several signs suggest the preacher is not the good man Sofie thought. After berating Brother Justin in the final episode, Sofie is locked in a barn where visions insinuate her as the Omega and Brother Justin as her father. She later shoots Jonesy, and her eyes have taken on the coal black appearance of Brother Justin's eyes. The final minutes of the series show Sofie finding Brother Justin dead in a cornfield. She lays <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his chest, and the corn around them dies.|$|E
500|$|William had {{crushed the}} Irish Jacobites by 1692, but he {{continued}} with campaigns abroad to wage war against France in the Netherlands. When her husband was away, Mary acted on her own if his advice was not available; whilst he was in England, Mary completely refrained from interfering in political matters, as had been agreed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights, and as she preferred. She proved a firm ruler, ordering the arrest of her own uncle, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, for plotting to restore James II to the throne. In January 1692, the influential John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough, was dismissed on similar charges; the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and further harmed {{her relationship with her}} sister Anne (who was strongly influenced by Churchill's wife, Sarah). Anne appeared at court with Sarah, obviously supporting the disgraced Churchill, which led to Mary angrily demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah and vacate her lodgings. Mary fell ill with a fever in April, and missed Sunday church service {{for the first time in}} 12 years. She also failed to visit Anne, who was suffering a difficult labour. After Mary's recovery and the death of Anne's baby soon after it was born, Mary did visit her sister, but chose the opportunity to berate Anne for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Marlborough was arrested and imprisoned, but then released after his accuser was revealed to be an impostor. Mary recorded in her journal that the breach between the sisters was a punishment from God for the [...] "irregularity" [...] of the Revolution. She was extremely devout, and attended prayers at least twice a day. Many of her proclamations focus on combating licentiousness, insobriety and vice. She often participated in the affairs of the Church—all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>On</b> the death of Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson in December 1694, Mary was keen to appoint Bishop of Worcester Edward Stillingfleet to the vacancy, but William over-ruled her and the post went to Bishop of Lincoln Thomas Tenison.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E

2500|$|In the post-Star Trek Nemesis novels, the Borg Queen {{is not a}} single, irreplaceable entity, but {{the product}} of a program called [...] "the Royal Protocol" [...] that shares its name with a Starfleet {{document}} outlining requirements when dealing with foreign royalty. This program is used to create a Borg Queen from any female Borg (though Borg drones supposedly have no gender), commanding the technology within her to alter and adapt to the protocol's specifications. In the relaunch novels, {{one of the leaders of}} Starfleet Intelligence gets <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Royal Protocol, and with the use of an emergency medical hologram, turns herself into a new kind of Borg Queen who cares about and loves her drones.|$|E
