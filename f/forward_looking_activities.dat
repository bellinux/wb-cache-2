It is note worthy that proper tourism planning backed up with policies and regulations are not or are ineffectively employed in the planning, implementation and management of tourism resource evaluation and destination development especially in developing countries. This has left some countries at the mercy of seasonal variations, while in others the benefits of tourism have not fully accrued to them. The paper therefore, recommends the adoption of conventional tourism planning, approach of process and the need for strategic planning of the tourism industry which is of the utmost importance in order to maximize tourism’s impact on socio-economic development and to avoid potential pit falls, in the industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{advances}} in robotics and imaging technologies have brought various imaging devices {{to the field}} of the unmanned exploration of new environments. <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar is one of the newly emerging imaging methods employed in the exploration of underwater environments. While the video sequences produced by <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar systems are characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution and limited range of sight, it is expected that video enhancement techniques will facilitate the interpretation of the video sequences. Since the video enhancement techniques for <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences are applicable to most of the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar sequences, the development of such techniques is more crucial than developing techniques for optical camera video enhancement, where only specially produced video sequences can benefit the techniques. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to enhance <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences via incorporating the knowledge of the target object obtained in previously observed frames. The proposed procedure includes inter-frame registration, linearization of image intensity, and maximum a posteriori fusion of images in the video sequence. The performance of this procedure is verified by enhancing video sequences of Dual-frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON), the market leading <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar system. ...|$|R

30|$|Using {{the tools}} of anticipatory governance—forward looking and participation—is {{essential}} in order to govern innovation actively and responsibly. Key principles of responsible research and innovation (RRI) recently given high prominence on EU and national level are therefore ‘anticipation, reflection and deliberation in and around research and innovation, influencing the direction of these and associated policy’ [2]. This entails mutual responsiveness between society and innovators, leading to higher acceptability, sustainability and desirability of innovation processes and products [3]. As a concept, RRI builds on ‘technology assessment and foresight, application of the precautionary principle, normative/ethical principles to design technology, innovation governance and stakeholder involvement and public engagement’ [4]. Gaining an understanding of futures is essential to RRI, and <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>activities</b> are therefore {{an integral part of}} the concept [5]. Therefore Foresight has been integrated in RRI toolkits [6, 7].|$|E
40|$|The Rational Addiction (RA) model {{assumes that}} {{individual}} {{decisions about the}} consumption of harmful and addictive commodities are made on a rational basis (Becker and Murphy, 1988). In this context, rational means <b>forward</b> <b>looking,</b> i. e. a tendency {{to take account of}} future consequences of current consumption decisions. Different individuals may well attach different weights to the present relative to the future. The degree to which an individual is <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> in her consumption decisions is revealed not by her current consumption level but rather by the time path of her consumption of an addictive commodity. Hence, the need to estimate a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> second order difference equation (SODE) as {{part of the process of}} testing the RA model. Most studies using micro level data estimate a single SODE for the whole sample. This involves estimating an average propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> for the entire sample, even when it is believed that different fully rational individuals in the same sample may have different propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking.</b> <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour is an aspect of treating the consumption of an addictive commodity as part of an inter-temporal optimization problem. Inter-temporal optimization is characterized by what are known as saddle point dynamics and the information about an individual’s propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is contained in what are known as the characteristic roots of the equation (Ferguson, 2003). In a sample of heterogeneous individuals we expect propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> to differ across individuals and the best way to identify these differences is by looking at the dynamic behaviour of the individual consumption paths. Estimating a common SODE for everyone hides this key difference. In this paper, we make the argument that the best place to look for differences in individual propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is in dynamic behaviour considered at different points in the distribution of the consumption of an addictive commodity. To do this we adopt techniques of Quantile Regression, (QR) estimating RA type difference equations in consumption across quantiles of cigarette consumption. We use panel data to ensure that we are examining the behaviour of individuals across time. Our hypothesis is that we will find differences in the degree of <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour characterizing the time paths of consumption across quantiles in the micro-level data. ...|$|R

30|$|Even though, <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>activities</b> {{have been}} and still are largely an experts’ game, {{including}} {{a greater variety of}} actors and perspectives is a demand that practitioners and scholars have been articulating for decades [38, 39]. Participatory methods for Futures Studies have been discussed since the 1960 ’s and {{over the last two decades}} practitioners developed and applied numerous participatory methods [40]. Here, stakeholder engagement has become a norm, but moving from interdisciplinary settings and stakeholders towards also including laypeople into <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>activities</b> can be increasingly observed [41 – 46]. Collective utopian thinking is seen as a tool for strategic long term thinking and transdisciplinary problem solving [47, 48]. Being especially equipped for dealing with complex wicked problems—highly interrelated, cross cutting extensive and potentially open ended issues—such as the Grand Challenges, post normal solution oriented knowledge co-creation requires constructive inputs of various types of knowledge, including norms and values [49, 50]. Some authors see this as means for shifting leadership from an individual activity to a co-creative act [51]. Several reasons for public participation are established in literature; producing better decisions and raising legitimacy among the most relevant ones [52 – 55]. On EU-level, shaping citizenry and strengthening trust in EU institutions may be added [56, 57]. In correspondence to the established functions of participation practices, Wiek and Iwaniec [58] describe several process-level functions of collective visioning activities: building capacity, empowering stakeholders, creating ownership, and developing accountability. Despite increasingly becoming established, transdisciplinarity is far from being a standard tool for supporting decision making and several barriers remain in place, such as failing or absent mechanisms for translating outcomes of deliberative processes into policy making, decision makers’ failing interest in or diffuse understanding of the use of such results, as well as slow and partial implementation of the participatory norm as laid out in EU constitutional treaties, that entails large room for interpretation [59 – 61].|$|E

40|$|Brock and Hommes (1997) {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} adaptive rational equilibrium dynamics (ARED), where agents choose between a costly rational expectation forecast and a cheap naive forecast, and the fractions using {{each of the two}} strategies evolve over time and are endogenously coupled to the market equilibrium price dynamics. In their setting agents are backward looking in the sense that strategy selection is based on experience measured by relative past realized profits. When the selection pressure to switch to the more profitable strategy is high, instability and complicated chaotic price fluctuations arise. In this paper we investigate the ARED with <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents, whose strategy selection is based upon expected profits. Our findings suggest that <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behavior dampens the amplitude of price fluctuations, but local instability of the steady state remains. The global dynamics depends upon how sophisticated the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behavior is. With perfectly <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents prices converge to a stable 2 -cycle, while with <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents who are boundedly rational concerning their estimate of expected profits, small amplitude chaotic price fluctuations may arise. We also establish an equivalence relationship between a heterogeneous agent model with switching of strategies and a representative agent framework, where the representative agent optimally chooses between the benefits of a high quality forecasts and the associated information gathering costs. To an outside observer it is impossible to distinguish between the two. ...|$|R
