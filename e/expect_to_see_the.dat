2500|$|The removal by Stein {{of so much}} {{cultural}} and archaeological material from China has caused anger in China, {{and there have been}} calls for the texts and artefacts collected by Stein from Dunhuang that are now in the British Museum and British Library to be repatriated to China. [...] Although the Chinese government has not formally requested their return, in 2003 an official at the Chinese Embassy in London stated that [...] "ittle by little, we will <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> return of items taken from Dunhuang — they should go back to their original place".|$|E
2500|$|Heller, a 1978 Boston University graduate, was heir to {{the capital}} of the Foreston Group, a family-owned {{conglomerate}} founded in 1906 that was the largest independent coal mining and distribution operation in the US, then valued at $150 million. In 1985, reviving the remnants of his family's real estate subdivision, Heller began developing residential real estate. During the years 1985-1990, he built some 1,500 apartments, including Le Chambord, a 23-story luxury condominium building at 350 East 72nd Street. About architecture, Heller expressed admiration of the iconic apartment houses of Rosario Candela. He founded Heller Macaulay Equities in 1989 with partner Duncan Macaulay. Of 1049 5th Avenue, Heller said, [...] "Never again in my lifetime do I <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> chance to build a great building on or within a few steps of Fifth Avenue".|$|E

2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are not going to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E
