In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{was elected}} the poet {{of the class}} of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an {{original}} poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838. He was suspended, however, and not allowed to participate. Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates. He had composed the poem in Concord, where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost because of his neglect of his studies. During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day; abolitionists, Thomas Carlyle, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists were treated.|$|E

50|$|Larive {{made his}} debut at the Comédie-Française on 3 December 1770 {{but was not}} well received. He left for Brussels where D'Hannetaire engaged him for the lead rôles at the Théâtre de la Monnaie and where he spent 4 years, acting {{alongside}} Dazincourt, Grandmesnil and Florence. It was here that he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>known</b> his future wife, Eugénie D'Hannetaire, the director's eldest daughter, whom he married in Paris on 18 June 1776 (they divorced in 1794). He {{was a friend of}} Voltaire and interpreted many of his lead roles.|$|R
5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> each other better than they ever had.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Thomson, Childish, Bill Lewis and Ming {{were members}} of The Medway Poets {{performance}} group, to which Absolon and Sanchia Lewis had earlier contributed. Peter Waite's Rochester Pottery staged a series of solo painting shows. In 1982, TVS broadcast a documentary on the poets. That year, Emin, then a fashion student, and Childish started a relationship; her writing was edited by Bill Lewis, printed by Thomson and published by Childish. Group members published dozens of works. The poetry group dispersed after two years, reconvening in 1987 to record The Medway Poets LP. Clark, Howard and Machine became involved over the following years. Thomson <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Williams, who was a local art student and whose girlfriend {{was a friend of}} Emin; Thomson also met Everall. During the foundation of the group, Ming brought in his girlfriend, Guru, who in turn invited Castle.|$|E
5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> each other. They stayed in {{contact with each other}} in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E

5000|$|He {{also spent}} time in Bergamo, as is {{documented}} by the altarpiece with Madonna and Saints in the parish church of Villa d'Adda, signed and dated 1656. In Bergamo, the artist <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>known</b> count Carlo Giacomo Vecchi, the still-life painter Evaristo Baschenis and art dealer Alberto Vanghetti, for whom he painted numerous paintings and with whom he remained a correspondence up to 1657. He then travelled to Venice {{at the invitation of}} Nicolò Sagredo, who had been Venice's ambassador to Rome and had already met with his brother Guillaume in Rome. Sagredo commissioned him to paint in the church of St. Mark two lunettes above the side doors as well as sacred stories in his gallery.|$|R
25|$|In 1900, Rilke {{stayed at}} the artists' colony at Worpswede. (Later, his {{portrait}} would be painted by the proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, whom he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> at Worpswede.) It was here that he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the sculptor Clara Westhoff, whom he married the following year. Their daughter Ruth (1901–1972) was born in December 1901.|$|E

25|$|The NaUKMA widely <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>known</b> {{for being}} the first {{university}} of which students and professors (among the other parties of the Orange Revolution in Kyiv) openly protested against the massive electoral selection fraud during the Ukrainian presidential election in 2004. After those events a museum dedicated to the Orange Revolution (Pomarancheva Revolyuziya-ukr.) was opened at the NaUKMA.|$|R

25|$|Bashir's {{dealing with}} foreign musical forms appears also in his {{experiments}} with alternative picking techniques. He made the fingerpicking, cultivated on the guitar – especially in flamenco – to an essential attribute of his mature style. But {{after a few}} experiments, he gave up using a thumb-plectrum (mizrab) that he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> during his studies of the Indian sitar.|$|E

She learned modern Greek, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the island, its people and culture and was known for her ability {{to get on with}} local workers on site. In this way, she {{can be seen as a}} pioneer of {{contemporary}} approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.|$|E
50|$|His {{ability and}} {{interest}} go for things of transcendence and sublimeness. That {{made a great}} impression on me. He took a very healthy road that started with chamber music, both {{with his mother and}} then more extensively at places like Ravinia and Marlboro, and he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>known</b> by the elders in the profession as somebody to look out for.|$|R

25|$|So {{we could}} get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On {{one side of the}} central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young {{painters}} organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41.
