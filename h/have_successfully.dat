5|$|In the United States, {{institutions}} of higher education set their own admission and credit policies for IB diploma recognition. Colorado and Texas have legislation requiring universities to adopt and implement policy which awards college credit to students who <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> completed the IBDP.]Texas Education Code Section 51.968(b); this section also requires each institution of higher education that offers freshman-level courses to adopt and implement a policy to grant undergraduate course credit to entering freshman students who have achieved required scores on one or more examinations in the Advanced Placement Program or the College-Level Examination Program, or who <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> completed one or more courses offered through concurrent enrollment in high school and at an institution of higher education.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E

Its biologists have pioneered the animal husbandry of jellyfish, and , it remains the only public aquarium to <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> exhibited a great white shark for more than 16 days. The aquarium's seafood consumer awareness program has had an influential role among consumers and businesses in enhancing sustainable fishing practices.|$|E
5|$|The dam and reservoir, {{along with}} other {{treatment}} structures built at and below the mine, <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred {{from time to time to}} dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E
5|$|The more neutron-rich {{darmstadtium}} isotopes are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies. The more neutron-rich isotopes 276Ds and 277Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium-232 and calcium-48, but the yield {{is expected to be}} low. Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success, and more recent experiments that <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half-life of 5.7ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.|$|E

Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut {{and placed a}} copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, Peter I Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty, after Norway's signing of the treaty in 1959. Since then, there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> landed tourists on the island.|$|E
5|$|The steep gorge walls make {{an ideal}} habitat for {{peregrine}} falcons, with a plentiful {{supply of food}} nearby {{in the form of}} pigeons and sea gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in the gorge, but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in the gorge after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to the gorge, and <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in the gorge, on which birds of prey soar while hunting. The gorge also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes in the caves and bridge buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) also takes nestlings, and {{powerful}} owl (Ninox strenua) {{has been recorded}} killing adults; other birds of prey are seen as threats, {{yet there is no}} evidence they <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> preyed on the ravens. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) has been recorded as a brood parasite.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 24 clubs {{have reached the}} final, of whom 16 have won the competition. The first winners were Dundee in 1990. The most {{successful}} club is Falkirk with four wins from four final appearances. Ross County, Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South have also reached the final four times, all winning and losing twice each. Three clubs have reached the final in successive seasons; Ayr United did so {{in the first two}} years of the tournament but lost both. The only teams to <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> defended their title are Hamilton Academical and the original Airdrieonians. It is possible for the winner of the tournament to be unable to defend their title; if a club is promoted from the Scottish Championship (second tier) in the same season to the Scottish Premiership (first tier), the club becomes ineligible to compete in the tournament. This has happened to Falkirk twice, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, St Mirren and Rangers.|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously claimed to <b>have</b> <b>successfully</b> shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released {{information on the}} first month of Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
