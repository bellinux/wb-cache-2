500|$|Gauci is an Australian Paralympic {{wheelchair}} basketball 2-point player. She began {{competing in}} 1996 {{when she was}} eleven years old, and was inspired {{to play for the}} Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team after watching their performance at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics. She enjoys the physical aspects of the game: [...] "I'm a big fan of the big hits in rugby league. The aggression in wheelchair basketball is not as fierce, but it's as close as I'm likely to get." [...] Her 2008 national team coach Gerry Hewson said, [...] "She's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good outside game and she can get inside and mix it with the best." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Can Do" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} and final single from Catfights and Spotlights. When Digital Spy questioned group member Keisha Buchanan about her reaction to its release, she responded: [...] "I'm really excited about it. I'm looking forward to people hearing another side to the album. This single has got a kind of Jackson 5 feel to it which I love. The whole album has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> old-school, laid-back Motown sound, so hopefully 'No Can Do' will get more people interested in the album." [...] "No Can Do" [...] {{was released}} as a digital download in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 19 December 2008. The following day, it was made available as a CD single, which consists of three remixes of the track and a cover version of Keane's song [...] "Spiralling".|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} Matthews' {{possible}} candidacy was raised at an October dinner fundraiser for presidential candidate Barack Obama held by Robert Wolf, president of UBS's investment bank. Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told The New York Times, [...] "People {{have asked me}} about it. I've never told anyone that I'm running." [...] On November 28, The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reported that Matthews met that week with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney and Executive Director Mary Isenhour to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, {{and she did not}} believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good job with MSNBC. I think he's going to put some thought into it before he jumps in." [...] The same day as that Patriot-News report, the political blog FiveThirtyEight.com reported that Matthews had already met with potential campaign staff, something Matthews claimed was [...] "absolutely not true".|$|E
60|$|It's {{so serious}} that I can't help {{thinking}} something will happen. Whenever I've <b>got</b> in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> tight fix something {{has turned up}} and put me on my legs again. Last time, Aunt Elizabeth had an apoplectic fit. But of course it wasn't really very profitable because mourning is so desperately expensive.|$|R

50|$|McDaniel {{concentrated}} upon {{having the}} student maintain a steady speed in those transitions, {{and although he}} emphasized that the student {{was not supposed to}} hurry, the student's speed of draw would generally progress very rapidly as his draw <b>got</b> smoother. <b>A</b> <b>really</b> fast draw using McDaniel's technique looks deceptively slow, because there is no contrast between what would normally be the slow parts of the draw and the fast parts.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman revealed that she was attracted to the mesh of sexuality and humour in the personality of Chrissie, declaring, [...] "What I really like is she's got the sex and dry sarcasm". Speaking to the official EastEnders website, she expanded on the importance of Chrissie's sense of humour and wit to her [...] "feisty" [...] characterisation: [...] "What I love about Chrissie is that she's a good strong, funny female character... she's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good sense of humour which is necessary to deal with Den. She's very good at wisecracks. Den has the one-liners, but Chrissie bats them right back." [...] Chrissie's barbed and biting remarks became a prominent feature of the character; even when cornered by Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) after attempting to flee the country, she remarks: [...] "You really are your father's daughter, Sharon. No shaking you off either." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{explore and}} create a new sound, Mars {{enlisted the help of}} Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker and Paul Epworth. The singer {{described}} this encounter as inviting [...] "master chefs into the kitchen with no master plan" [...] or any kind of outcome, [...] "either a complete disaster or something outstanding". Previously, Benny Blanco, Emile Haynie, Diplo, Supa Dups, as well as Mars' production team The Smeezingtons, have been confirmed to have worked on the album. The first song written for Unorthodox Jukebox was [...] "Gorilla", which [...] "set the tone for the entire project"; Mars explained in an interview granted to MTV News that it became its mascot hence the reason it ended up as the album cover. In an interview for the Rolling Stone, Blanco confessed, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> cool song with him. Me and Paul [...] just got together and Bruno wrote an amazing song on top of it. It kind of all came together". He further explained that [...] "it's like some throwback Nina Simone type shit, like 'Sinnerman'". Additionally, a [...] "piano-laced" [...] track was conceived for the album in its opening session.|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON. Theyre {{really very}} nice people. I confess I was afraid the husband {{would turn out}} an appalling bounder. But he's almost as charming in his way as she is in hers. And theres no mistake about his being a genius. It's {{something}} to have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> case <b>really</b> worth saving. Somebody else will have to go; but at all events it will be easy to find a worse man.|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to}} <b>really</b> be {{involved}} in the studio writing tracks and lyrics, everything. It’s a lot more personal experience and the album itself is a combination of different sounds, electronic, R&B, pop and it’s definitely something you can play loud in the club.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Jeff Gordon {{took the}} lead from Joey Logano on the final restart and sailed to victory lane for the 91st time in his career. Gordon had this to say, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good restart, and I got to his quarter panel in Turn 1 and I was able to drag him back and it allowed me to get the {{momentum}} and get by him." [...] "I had (Gordon) cleared," [...] Logano said. [...] "I should have pulled {{down in front of}} him. He got next to me, and I couldn't get away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2002 {{they were}} invited by ABC's Radio National to {{represent}} Australia at the European Broadcasting Union's International Folk Festival in Hamburg. Lucas recalled [...] "e {{were a bit}} different… {{it was kind of}} scary, but it was really good. We <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good response. We got in the local paper. We got to meet the Mayor of Hamburg town. We couldn’t understand what he was saying to us, and he couldn’t understand us either, so we had a great time". During the following year they performed at various Australian festivals and at venues across the country. A proposed appearance at the 2003 Shanghai Spring International Music Festival in May was postponed to the following year due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. They toured southern China and were broadcast by radio stations based in Shanghai.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, A-Force {{tied into}} the [...] "Civil War II" [...] storyline {{beginning}} with issue #8. About the crossover, Thompson said, [...] "There's no way, with our cast, that we weren't {{going to get}} drawn into it – Carol is obviously the big co-star of [...] "Civil War II" [...] and both Medusa and She-Hulk are poised to play big roles too. But I think we've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great A-Force story that ties directly to the event but will also {{stand on its own}} nicely. Because of the intricacies of [...] "Civil War II" [...] the ideas behind the event really pull our team apart – so what we're doing is a very personal and emotional gut punch of a story for these ladies who were sort of just getting started as friends and as a team." ...|$|E

2500|$|PC Gamer UKs Andy Butcher wrote, [...] "Al-Qadim tries {{hard to be}} accessible, inoffensive {{and appeal}} to the masses, but ... it's {{unlikely}} to whet the appetites of either hardened role-players (it's far too superficial) or newcomers (it's <b>got</b> little of <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good RPG's appeal)." [...] In PC Zone, David McCandless summarized the game as [...] "not very good", with [...] "poor" [...] graphics and [...] "awful" [...] combat.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2011, Rawle {{revealed}} that Silas's storyline would soon {{come to a}} conclusion. He told This Morning [...] " [...] We've been waiting {{a long time to}} see what's going to happen with Silas and over the next three months we've got some cracking storylines which end in an awful climax, which I can't say anything about." [...] The actor also opined that Silas's family would be [...] "ripped asunder" [...] after finding out that he is a killer. Marquess first mentioned the storyline's climax in January 2011. He told Digital Spy [...] "I know what the ending of the serial killer story will be, when it is, and I know how brilliant it is. I'm hoping that story will have the audience jumping up and down and shouting at the telly, because it's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> big 'look behind you' element to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After President Trump {{took office}} in January 2017, Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, began {{to work on a}} plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They faced {{opposition}} from both Democrats and moderate Republicans, who claimed that the bill would leave too many people uninsured, and more conservative Republicans, who protested that the bill kept too many of the ACA's regulation and spending increases, and was thus not a full repeal. Numerous attempts at repeal failed. On June 27, after a meeting with President Trump at the White House, McConnell signaled improvements for the repeal and replacement: [...] "We're not quite there. But I think we’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good chance of getting there. It’ll just take us a little bit longer." [...] During a Rotary Club lunch on July 6, McConnell said, [...] "If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reinhart {{is heavily}} {{inspired}} by various musical genres, including rock and roll, funk, pop, jazz, blues, and even African percussion, {{due to her}} parents' eclectic musical tastes while she was growing up. They were fans of rock legends such as Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix {{as well as more}} traditional pioneering jazz artists. More specifically, she cites The Beatles and band members Paul McCartney and John Lennon as her greatest musical influences. She states that [...] "people always want me to say a female name", and further explains that such an action would not be reality for her and that saying so would be disingenuous. She admires the singers' ability to have smooth, bluesy voices at some points and raw, gritty, visceral voices at others. Due to her parents' influences, she also grew up idolizing such artists as Sarah Vaughan, Heart, and Tony Bennett. When she was young, she also helped her mother learn songs by Billie Holiday. She explains, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good ear from just shedding out different tunes and learning different genres." [...] Her album Better was heavily inspired by retro funk band Sly and the Family Stone.|$|E
5000|$|Sandi is {{the second}} {{daughter}} in the novel, the pretty one who could [...] "pass as an American, with soft blue eyes and fair skin". We see the loving and caring part of her personality emerge in [...] "Floor Show" [...] where {{at a very young}} age she decides that if her family <b>got</b> into <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad financial situation, she would attempt to get adopted by a rich family, get an allowance [...] "like other American girls got" [...] which she would then pass onto her family. The spot-light falls on her again when she goes away to a graduate program and her parents receive a letter from the dean saying Sandra has been hospitalized after an extreme diet, revealing that she is anorexic. She dreams of being an artist. She broke her arm.|$|R
5000|$|The amount {{invested}} in the UK allocation has also varied. During the early 1970s, UK equities and bonds fell from 63 per cent in 1972 to nearly 45 per cent of the Trust two years later. While some of this decline reflects steep relative falls in the UK stock market, it also reflects a deliberate {{move away from the}} UK. The exasperation of the chairman comes through in his 1975 statement: [...] "The fact is that this country has <b>got</b> itself into <b>a</b> <b>really</b> dreadful mess... We continue to have more confidence in investment prospects overseas than in the UK".|$|R

5000|$|Asked in October 2015 if Sanctuary {{has been}} writing new {{material}} for a fourth album, frontman Warrel Dane replied, [...] Lenny's gotta get off his butt and write some tunes for me, so I've got something to do in my bedroom when I'm alone with my computer and <b>a</b> microphone. He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bunch of riffs and some rough songs written. They're really, really good. It's the beginning stages of that. There was one song that got left off The Year The Sun Died. I don't remember why we didn't record it, but it just didn't get finished. It's kind of... It's really fast and really brutal. I'm pretty sure it's gonna make it on the next one. He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lot of <b>really</b> good shit written. So it's {{just a matter of}} putting it all together and having me work out all the vocal melodies and the lyrics and everything.

50|$|Most of Andeel's work {{is based}} on {{political}} satire.His uncle {{told him that his}} paternal grandfather was a filmmaker who made a feature film called “Horses,” which he took to the Berlin Film Festival. Due to racism it was overlooked for the big prize though it clearly deserved it, and on the boat back to Egypt he threw the only copy of the film overboard and retired from cinema. Knowledge of this outrage compelled Andeel to move to Cairo and become a professional cartoonist at a very early age, as well as making short films (such as “Who Knows?”, a psychedelic film noir set in the wild west), writing TV scripts, designing newspapers, co-founding “Tok Tok” comics magazine, launching “Radhio Kafril Sheikh el Habeeba,” and using Facebook a lot. He is studying for a certificate in social work. In 2012 he <b>got</b> married to <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great woman.|$|R
5000|$|Nichols {{notes that}} after {{coming up with}} a sketch idea, they would perform it soon after with little extra {{rehearsal}} or writing it down. One example he remembered was inspired simply from a phone call from his mother. I called Elaine and I said, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good piece for us tonight." [...] They created a six-minute-long, mostly improvised, [...] "mother and son" [...] sketch, which they performed later that night.|$|E

500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> reputation that <b>really</b> sprang out of nothing." ...|$|R

I was flying in those first two weeks and then suddenly I was in Nashville with really famous songwriters, partly thinking 'WOW!' but also 'Right, let’s do this.'" [...] The album features writing credits and production {{from the likes of}} Steve Mac, Wayne Hector, Nick Atkinson, David Sneddon#The Nexus, Paul Barry, Cass Lowe, Patrick Mascall, Kylie Sackley, Brandon Hood and Martin Terefe, who between them have produced for the likes of Gabrielle Aplin, Lana Del Rey, Enrique Iglesias, LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill and Jason Mraz. Filan revealed that he took inspiration from the likes of The Lumineers, Train and Mumford & Sons when writing and recording the album.|$|R
