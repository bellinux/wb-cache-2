2500|$|Over the 20th century, {{legislation}} {{and changes in}} court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law. First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where [...] "freedom of contract" [...] appeared far more {{on the side of}} large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as [...] "contracts of adhesion" [...] where there was no real negotiation and most people were given [...] "take it or leave it" [...] terms. The courts began by requiring entirely clear information before onerous clauses could be enforced, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 switched the burden of proof onto business to show misleading statements were not negligent, and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 created the jurisdiction to scrap contract terms that were [...] "unreasonable", considering the bargaining power of the parties. Collective bargaining by trade unions {{and a growing number of}} employment rights carried the employment contract into an autonomous field of labour law where workers had rights, like a minimum wage, fairness in dismissal, the right to join a union and take collective action, and these could not be given up in a contract with an employer. Private housing was subject to basic terms, such as the right to repairs, and restrictions on unfair rent increases, though many protections were abolished during the 1980s. Nevertheless, the scope of the general law of contract had been reduced. It meant that most contracts made by people on an ordinary day were shielded from the power of corporations to impose whatever terms they chose in selling goods and services, at work, and in people's home. Nevertheless, classical contract law remained at the foundation of those specific contracts, unless particular rights were given by the courts or Parliament. Internationally, the UK had joined the European Union, which aimed to harmonise significant parts of consumer and employment law across member states. Moreover, with increasing openness of markets commercial contract law was receiving principles from abroad. Both the Principles of European Contract Law, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, and the practice of international commercial arbitration was reshaping thinking about English contract principles in an increasingly <b>globalised</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} {{competition}} law refers to attempts by governments to regulate competitive markets for goods and services, {{leading up to}} the modern competition or antitrust laws around the world today. The earliest records traces back to the efforts of Roman legislators to control price fluctuations and unfair trade practices. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, kings and queens repeatedly cracked down on monopolies, including those created through state legislation. The English common law doctrine of restraint of trade became the precursor to modern competition law. This grew out of the codifications of United States antitrust statutes, which in turn had considerable influence on the development of European Community competition laws after the Second World War. Increasingly the focus has moved to international competition enforcement in a <b>globalised</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to the {{official}} founding LNDP program adopted at the LNDP constituent congress of the January 30, 1999, the Lithuanian National Democratic Party's goal is to strengthen and maintain the Lithuanian people and the independent state of Lithuania, and ensure {{that the state is}} rich, secure, and equally fair to all its citizens. The party is guided by the principles of national democracy, an ideology it views as a middle way between anarchism, liberalism, and totalitarianism, which it claims are responsible for Lithuania's growing income disparity and cultural and moral decay. The party seeks a pragmatic approach to the Lithuanian economy, seeking to maintain and strengthen a free market that is agricultural, supports small and big businesses alike, is modern and competitive in a <b>globalised</b> <b>economy,</b> and encourages investment whilst also maintaining and implementing measures to ensure Lithuanian control over Lithuanian goods, services, and wealth. The LNDP also seeks to maintain equal opportunities for all by creating favourable opportunities for every citizen, according to his abilities to work, earn, save, and buy, and wants local governments to implement sufficient income to the population's needs for funding. The party, although supporting economical and cross border relations, is also bitterly opposed to the European union, regarding it as a [...] "Nation State" [...] that threatens the freedom and individualism of the Lithuanian state and other Independent European states.|$|E
