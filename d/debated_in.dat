5|$|Plans {{to bestow}} Suharto with a National Hero title are {{currently}} being considered by the Indonesian government and has been highly <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia.

5|$|The {{families}} of Mecoptera are well accepted by taxonomists but their relationships have been <b>debated.</b> <b>In</b> 1987, R. Willman treated the Mecoptera as a clade, containing the Boreidae as sister to the Meropeidae, but in 2002 M. F. Whiting declared the Mecoptera paraphyletic, with the Boreidae as sister to another order, the Siphonaptera (fleas).|$|E

25|$|There {{have always}} been differing {{opinions}} as to the divinity of God, the Son, and or his unity with God, the Father. Although historically the most significant <b>debate</b> <b>in</b> this arena was the Arianism and trinitarianism <b>debate</b> <b>in</b> the Roman Empire, <b>debates</b> <b>in</b> this realm have occurred throughout Christian history.|$|R
5|$|The {{possibility}} of installing a rail link {{from what was}} originally known as the Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s under the Bolte State Government, but with not enough support shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> prior years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet to {{formulate}} a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} conformity was {{passed through the}} House of Commons and <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> the Lords. Figures such as Henry Sacheverell, a High church clergyman, warned against Dissenters assuming positions of political power. His lead {{was followed by the}} Tory press, who published a number of sermons and pamphlets making similar arguments. In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, The Shortest Way, assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{extension}} {{bill was}} <b>debated.</b> <b>In</b> February 1903, Parliament {{had established a}} Royal Commission on London Traffic to assess {{the manner in which}} transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed. Both bills were later withdrawn by their promoters. The powers bills were approved as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903 and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1903 on 11 August 1903.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2008, {{the drive}} shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, {{leading to an}} {{emergency}} landing at Billund Airport.

5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has been much <b>debated.</b> <b>In</b> particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E
5|$|The Borders Railway {{bill was}} <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> September 2005 and a motion {{supporting}} {{it was passed}} with 102 in favour, none against and one abstention. On 9 May 2006, the bill committee published its final report supporting the project with two recommendations: a station had to be provided at Stow and the line had to be completed to its full extent, i.e. as far as Tweedbank. These recommendations were accepted by the Scottish Parliament in the final debate on the bill on 14 June 2006. The bill was carried by 114 votes to one.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the temple has {{withstood}} earthquake shocks, without any damage to its circular structural features, {{in the past several}} centuries. The temple is in the Seismic Zone III.

5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> modern scholarship. The {{followers}} of Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, {{there is evidence that}} Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of hare coursing has only recently, in historical terms, been <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for coursing.

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Finan, bishop of Lindisfarne, Alhfrith of Deira, in {{collusion}} with Wilfred of York, Agilbert of Wessex and others, were determined to persuade Oswiu to rule in favour of the Roman rite of Christianity within the kingdoms over which he had imperium. The case was <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> Oswiu's presence at the Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colmán, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colmán, departed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely <b>debated</b> <b>in</b> the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E
