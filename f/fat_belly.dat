6000|$|When {{we reached}} our old camp in Barber Shop Canyon {{we were all}} glad to see Haught's lost burro waiting for us there. Not a scratch showed on the shaggy {{lop-eared}} little beast. Haught for once unhobbled a burro and set it free without a parting kick. Nielsen too had observed this omission on Haught's part. Nielsen was a desert man and he knew burros.

It seemed the bear hunter was noted for that habit of kicking burros. Sometimes he was in fun and sometimes, when burros were obstinate, he was in earnest. Upon one occasion a big burro stayed away from camp quite a long time--long enough to incur Haught's displeasure. He needed the burro and could not find it, and {{all he could do was}} to hunt for it. Upon returning to camp there stood the big gray burro, lazy and fat, just as if he had been perfectly well behaved. Haught put a halter on the burro, using strong language the while, and then he proceeded to exercise his habit of kicking burros. He kicked this one until its <b>fat</b> <b>belly</b> gave forth sounds exceedingly like a bass drum. When Haught had ended his exercise he tied up the burro.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 160 barrows (PIC, {{initially}} 68. 4 lb) {{were used in}} a 97 -d study to {{determine the influence of}} glycerol and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) on growing-finishing pig performance, carcass characteristics, and fat quality. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments with 7 replications per treatment. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) and DDGS (0 or 20 %). Overall (d 0 to 97), there were no glycerol × DDGS interactions (P > 0. 12) for growth performance, carcass characteristics, and carcass fat iodine value (IV). Increasing glycerol did not affect (P > 0. 14) ADG or F/G. Adding 20 % DDGS to the diet did not affect ADG. However, pigs fed diets with 20 % added DDGS had greater (P < 0. 02) ADFI resulting in poorer (P < 0. 01) F/G than pigs fed diets with no DDGS. For carcass characteristics, pigs fed increasing glycerol tended to have increased (linear, P < 0. 11) yield. Pigs fed diets with added DDGS had increased (P < 0. 01) jowl <b>fat,</b> <b>belly</b> fat, and backfat IV compared with pigs fed diets with no DDGS. However, increasing dietary glycerol tended to decrease (linear, P < 0. 11) backfat IV.

At {{the end of the}} trial, jowl <b>fat,</b> <b>belly</b> fat, and backfat samples were collected and analyzed for fatty acid profile and iodine value (IV). From d 0 to 78, ADG and ADFI decreased (linear; P 0. 22) in loin depth, but increasing DDGS tended to decrease (P< 0. 09) backfat and fat-free lean index (FFLI). Backfat, jowl fat, and belly fat iodine values and percentage C 18 : 2 fatty acids increased (linear, P< 0. 02) with increasing DDGS in both the “topped” pigs marketed 21 d before trial conclusion and pigs marketed at trial completion. Increasing DDGS decreased (linear, P< 0. 05) percentage saturated fatty acids in backfat and belly fat in both marketing groups and percentage saturated fatty acids in jowl fat with increasing DDGS in the diet in the pigs marketed at trial completion. Barrows had decreased (P< 0. 04) belly fat iodine values and percentage 18 : 2 fatty acids when compared to gilts. Barrows also had increased (P< 0. 05) jowl fat and belly fat percentage 18 : 2 fatty acids when compared to gilts. Based on these results and previous research trials, dried distillers grain with solubles from this source can be fed up to 15 % before seeing reductions in ADG; however, the increase in iodine value and decrease in dressing percentage must be considered in determining the economic value of DDGS...|$|E
