5|$|The costumes were {{designed}} by Anthony Mendleson, who matched Louis's rise through the social ranks with his changing costumes. When employed as a shop assistant, Louis's suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a brocade <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and waiting for his execution in a quilted-collar velvet jacket. Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, the costumes were of less importance than make-up and the actor's nuances.|$|E
25|$|Room 7 {{places the}} visitor in the 19th century with Gioachino Rossini, {{whose name is}} forever tied to Bologna. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first {{recitals}} of Isabella Colbran, a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of The Barber of Seville and some rather curious personal effects, like a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by Camille Pleyel.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{financial}} situation, Marriott jokingly later renamed the group Steve Marriott and the Official Receivers. In the mid-1980s Marriott and Poulton {{moved to a}} rented cottage in the small village of Arkesden. The 16th century cottage was also used for location shots for {{the home of the}} title character in the BBC's long-running television series Lovejoy, starring Ian McShane. Marriott became well-known locally, often popping into the pub opposite his home to buy bottles of brandy and borrowing glasses. He once turned up wearing trainers and a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and became something of an eccentric figure, playing pranks, particularly on the owner of the pub.|$|E
50|$|The full <b>dress</b> <b>gown</b> is {{a scarlet}} clerical-type gown, with open {{bell-shaped}} sleeves and {{gathered at the}} yoke. The sleeves and facings are in the appropriate coloured silk. Full <b>dress</b> <b>gowns</b> are normally worn with sub-fusc, but never with a hood.|$|R
50|$|Silk: Silk <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> {{are popular}} {{because of their}} look and feel, but can be {{relatively}} expensive. Silk robes are very thin and lightweight, and are not particularly suited to wet situations because they lack the surface area and polarity necessary to absorb water. However, silk <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> are the traditional choice, since they are not worn after bathing.|$|R
50|$|There is no full <b>dress</b> <b>gown</b> for the {{professional}} doctorates so the doctor's undress gown is worn.|$|R
25|$|Although {{his army}} was {{supposed}} to join that of Washington's in Pennsylvania, Lee set a very slow pace. On the night of December 12, Lee and a dozen of his guard inexplicably stopped for the night at White's Tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, some three miles from his main army. The next morning, a British patrol of two dozen mounted soldiers found Lee writing letters in his <b>dressing</b> <b>gown,</b> and captured him. Among {{the members of the}} British patrol was Cornet Banastre Tarleton and William Harcourt, 3rd Earl Harcourt. Lee returned to service {{a couple of years later}} after he was exchanged for General Richard Prescott.|$|E
25|$|In July 1967, McFall, aged 18 {{and eight}} months {{pregnant}} with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried {{at the edge of}} a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalange bones were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb. Although Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, he confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. Nonetheless, this explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{received}} him in trademark fashion: in bed, {{wearing an}} embroidered <b>dressing</b> <b>gown,</b> smoking a cigar. He, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had discussed {{the matter of}} Yugoslavia at a recent conference in Teheran, and had decided to give all possible support to the Partisans. This was the turning point. The Chetniks were given a task (a bridge to blow up) and a deadline, to show whether they could still be effective allies; they failed this test and supplies were re-directed from them to the Partisans. The British government was left with the tricky political and moral problem of King Peter and his royalist government in exile. But the main issues were air supplies and air support, and to help co-ordinate this, Maclean's mission was expanded. Some of the new officers included Andrew Maxwell of the Scots Guards, John Clarke of the 2nd Scots Guards, Geoffrey Kup, a gunnery expert, Hilary King, a signals officer, Johnny Tregida, and, for a time, Randolph Churchill. Some of these were SAS or otherwise known from the Western Desert Campaign the previous year.|$|E

25|$|All gowns, {{other than}} the <b>dress</b> <b>gowns</b> of doctors, are made from black material. The <b>dress</b> <b>gowns</b> of Doctors of Philosophy and other doctors of this level (such as DBA, DArch and EdD) are made in claret, while those of higher doctors are made from scarlet cloth. For this purpose, the degree of Doctor of Medicine was {{originally}} classed as a higher doctorate. In recent years, however, Nottingham Doctors of Medicine have been observed in the claret-coloured gown instead.|$|R
2500|$|Since medieval times, doctors, like {{bishops and}} cardinals, have been {{authorised}} to wear garments of brighter colours such as scarlet, purple or red. In many older universities, doctors have scarlet <b>dress</b> <b>gowns</b> or robes (sometimes called [...] "festal robes") which are worn on special occasions. There are two distinctive shapes {{used in the}} UK for doctor's gown; the Oxford doctor's shape and the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge MusD <b>dress</b> <b>gown</b> which is a pattern between the two.|$|R
25|$|Baker-Carr {{recalled}} Wilson {{standing in}} <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and slippers uttering “sardonic little jests to all and sundry within earshot” as GHQ packed up to evacuate, behaviour which historian Dan Todman comments was probably “reassuring for some but profoundly irritating for others”. Macready recorded Wilson (27 August) “walking slowly up and down” {{the room at}} Noyon which had been commandeered as headquarters with a “comical, whimsical expression”, clapping his hands and chanting “We shall never get there, we shall never get there … to the sea, to the sea, to the sea”, although he also recorded that this was probably intended {{to keep up the}} spirits of more junior officers. His infamous “sauve qui peut” order to Snow, GOC 4th Division, (27 August) ordering unnecessary ammunition and officers’ kits to be dumped so that tired and wounded soldiers could be carried, was, according to Swinton, probably intended out of concern for the soldiers rather than out of panic. Smith-Dorrien was later rebuked by French for countermanding it. Lord Loch thought the order showed “GHQ had lost their heads” whilst General Haldane thought it “a mad order” (both in their diaries for 28 August). Major-General Pope-Hennessey later alleged (in the 1930s) that Wilson had ordered the destruction of orders issued during the retreat to hide the degree of panic.|$|E
500|$|... "Why", asked Coward, [...] "am I always {{expected}} {{to wear a}} dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" [...] The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been {{taken up by the}} upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: [...] "I am determined to travel through life first class." [...] He first wore a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter. George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, [...] "His famous silk, polka-dot <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era. But 2008 is proving to be the year that Britain falls in love with Noël Coward all over again." ...|$|E
500|$|Sherlock Holmes {{enters his}} drawing room {{to find it}} being burgled, but on confronting the villain is {{surprised}} when the latter disappears. Holmes initially attempts to ignore the event by lighting a cigar, but upon the thief's reappearance, Holmes tries to reclaim the sack of stolen goods, drawing a pistol from his <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> pocket and firing it at the intruder, who vanishes. After Holmes recovers his property, the bag vanishes from his hand into that of the thief, who promptly disappears through a window. At this point the movie ends abruptly with Holmes looking [...] "baffled".|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{distinctive}} shapes {{used in the}} UK for doctor's gowns; the Oxford doctor's {{shape and}} the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge Doctor of Music <b>dress</b> <b>gown</b> which is a pattern between the two. [...] The other form of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the <b>dress</b> <b>gown</b> instead; however, the undress gown still plays {{a part in the}} older universities where academic dress is usually worn.|$|R

500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, containing the Bible, Eddy's writings {{and a list}} of directors and financial contributors, was laid in May 1894 in the Back Bay area of Boston. Church members raised funds for the construction, and the building was finished in December 1894 at a cost of $250,000. It contained a [...] "Mother's Room" [...] in the tower for Eddy's personal use, furnished with rare books, silks, tapestries, rugs, a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and slippers, though she spent only one night there and it was later turned into a storage room. The archway into the room was made of Italian marble, and the word Mother was engraved on the floor.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth episode {{features}} {{a scene where}} Mark jams his <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> {{in the door and}} is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour's flat. This sequence was Moffat's revenge for Bathurst's late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London. Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst was naked. After being mistaken for a flasher, Mark is punched by his neighbour's brother. When he awakens he is confronted by a man (Kerry Shale) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be [...] "his very best friend". In the fifth episode it transpires that the man, who identifies himself as Dick, is the personification of Mark's penis.|$|E

500|$|Together with Mike Rann, his Press Secretary, speechwriter and {{eventually}} Premier, {{who had worked}} with him in 1978 on a series of speeches on Aboriginal Land Rights, industrial democracy and women's rights, Dunstan made a uranium fact-finding trip to Europe to study safe methods of nuclear power and waste disposal. [...] By the summer that followed, Dunstan fell extremely ill. When Parliament resumed, he collapsed {{on the floor of the}} House and was forced to use a walking stick; his doctor advised him that he required six months of rest to recover. The Liberal Opposition seized on the state of affairs and charged that the Labor Party was [...] "as ailing as the man who led it". In a stage-managed press conference on 15 February 1979, Dunstan announced his retirement as premier from his room in Calvary Hospital while shaking and wearing a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown.</b>|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my <b>dressing</b> <b>gown)</b> and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and {{consequently}} that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|Walker came on deck in his <b>dressing</b> <b>gown,</b> and {{saw that}} the ship was being driven toward the western lee shore by the east wind. [...] When the French {{navigator}} came on deck, he explained to Walker where he was; Walker immediately ordered the anchor cables cut, and beat against the wind to escape the danger. [...] Two of the warships, Montague and Windsor, had more difficulty, and ended up anchored for the night in a precarious situation, surrounded by breakers. [...] Throughout the night, Walker heard sounds of distress, and at times when the fog lifted, ships could be seen in the distance being ground against the rocks. [...] One New Englander wrote that he could [...] "hear the shrieks of the sinking, drowning, departing souls." [...] Around 2:00 am the wind subsided, and then shifted to the northwest, and most of the fleet managed to stand away from the shore.|$|E

500|$|On 13 April 1943 the {{committee}} of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – {{that he needed to}} obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that [...] "in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.|$|E
500|$|Chartwell {{remained}} a haven {{in times of}} acute stress – Churchill {{had spent the night}} there just before the fall of France in 1940. Summoned back to London by a desperate plea from Lord Gort for permission to retreat to Dunkirk, Churchill broadcast the first of his wartime speeches to the nation; [...] "Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour...for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation..." [...] He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe to relieve Tobruk, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, General Wavell. John Colville recorded Churchill's deliberations in his diary; [...] "spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> and grey felt hat took me to see his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive". Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the Normandy landings, his secretary recorded that the house was [...] "shut up and rather desolate".|$|E
500|$|The year 1959 was professionally {{disastrous}} for Hordern. He made {{a return to}} stage at the Old Vic in Arthur Wing Pinero's The Magistrate in which he played Mr. Posket. The play was not particularly successful and received mixed reviews: According to the author and theatre critic J. P. Wearing, Hordern was miscast, while a reporter for The Stage, thought he gave a [...] "convincing portrayal". Wearing believed that overall the play was not [...] "played briskly enough", while a critic for The Times thought that it had [...] "durable theatrical quality". [...] The role was followed with a part of Pastor Manders in Ghosts opposite Flora Robson. The Sunday Times published an unenthusiastic notice, and thought Hordern's character had [...] "an anxious air" [...] about him. He received equally critical notices when he took to the stage to play the title character in Macbeth, opposite Beatrix Lehmann. The press wrote of Hordern's [...] "unintended comic interpretation" [...] when characterising the evil king: [...] "Half his time on stage he cringed like an American carpet seller in an ankle-length black <b>dressing</b> <b>gown</b> of fuzzy candlewick" [...] thought one reviewer, {{who went on to}} say [...] "he would make a sinister Shylock, a frightening Fagin.
