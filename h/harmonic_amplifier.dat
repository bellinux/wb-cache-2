40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the relationship between altimetry measurement, especially significant wave height (SWH) measurement, and phase distortion is still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this Ph. D. study is first to outline this relationship by a simulation using a model that considers the errors from both the signal source and the power amplifier. The simulation results show the power amplifier influence is more significant than that of signal source in SWH estimation, and that the phase errors influence is worse for lower SWH conditions. It is recommended from the simulation that the group delay error of the whole transmitter link, after the chirp generator, should be well controlled to be under 0. 5 ns. In the payload design, Class-F is chosen as the amplifier operation mode due to its high efficiency and fewer harmonic frequency components. The difference between the operational principles of second and third <b>harmonic</b> peaking Class-F <b>amplifiers</b> have been illustrated by the simulation. Both of them can achieve high efficiency and high gain, however the third harmonic peaking Class-F is simpler to implement. Therefore it was chosen by the final design. In the simulation, a large signal STATZ model is set up, followed by the S-band Class-F amplifier design simulation and the implementation of third <b>harmonic</b> peaking Class-F <b>amplifier.</b> Based on this, an adaptive feedback group delay equalizer is proposed as a solution for the phase error compensation within the whole chirp signal swept bandwidth. A very simple but effective phase error detection and calculation circuit is designed, built and measured. The test branch results are very satisfying.

The key payload design problems are identified in a thorough feasibility study: the restriction corresponding to these main problems is quantified via the SWH estimation simulation.

The focus of this body of work is to optimize narrow band power amplifiers for maximization of Power-Added-Efficiency (PAE) and rectifiers for maximization of RF-DC power conversion efficiency. A power amplifier performs DC-RF conversion while a rectifier performs RF-DC conversion, therefore a strong analogy exists between the two. Design with non-linear devices suffers from lack of accurate models characterizing large signal behavior, therefore measurement based techniques are often adopted {{in order to create}} high performance designs. The theoretical analysis presented in this thesis provides the microwave circuit designer intuition concerning performance expectations of design options rather than a recipe for creating a successful design. The complexity of non-linear device physics results in behavior which is often limited to qualitative description, complicating accurate model development. The presented theoretical analysis is applied to load-pull based design of S-Band and X-Band power amplifiers and S-Band power rectifiers.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Three {{types of}} low noise {{amplifiers}} operating at 2. 4 GHz were designed. They are the commonly used single-ended and differential amplifiers {{as well as}} a new quasi-differential amplifier. The substrate noise injected into these amplifiers is examined for both heavily and lightly doped CMOS substrates. For the single-ended amplifier the noise is modeled in SPICE with good correlation between measurements and simulations. Using these models and simulations the major noise coupling mechanisms are identified. In both types of substrates, harmonics of the clock couple into the bond pads and the inductor at the LNA output. Intermodulation products of the clock and the RF carrier are produced by noise coupling directly into the input transistor in the heavily doped substrate or into the gate interconnect in the lightly doped substrate. Methods of noise mitigation are identified and simulated for each substrate. In the differential <b>amplifier</b> <b>harmonic</b> noise is dominated by unequal coupling into passive circuitry. Intermodulation noise in the differential amplifier arises from coupling of substrate noise into the active devices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} improve the power added efficiency (PAE) of GaN power amplifiers by an appropriate shaping of the gate source voltage waveform. High efficiency performances of microwave power amplifiers are reached by implementing proper matching conditions at harmonic components. For microwave applications, <b>harmonic</b> tuned <b>amplifiers</b> offer for the moment the best energy conversion efficiency between DC supply and RF power at fundamental frequency available in a 50  load. [1] In addition to proper harmonic terminations, the minimization of power losses at fundamental frequency in the output RF matching and power combining circuit is of prime importance. This has been widely reported {{over the past few}} years. Considering this main aspect GaN technology offers an evident advantage due to its high drain voltage operation capability that is beneficial for designing low loss and wideband output matching circuits. Several works have been reported during the past few years. [2],[3],[4],[5],[6] A problem encountered when designing high efficiency power amplifiers is to avoid getting high efficiency performances restricted to only a narrow frequency bandwidth around center frequency. It can be often observed that the higher the PAE is at center frequency, the quicker the PAE decreases at offset frequencies each side away from the center frequency. This can be attributed to high Q resonant tuning conditions. We point out and examine in this paper a major role played by the gate source voltage waveform in PAE performances over a frequency bandwidth of interest. For power amplifiers operating at saturated power, a significant second harmonic current component exists at the gate port and is terminated into a passive resonant circuit like for example a quarter wave length line used in the gate bias circuit. For offset frequencies, phase conditions of the passive source impedance at second harmonic vary and lead to non appropriate enlarged gate source voltage waveform upper the pinch off value. That leads to larger turn on time of the drain current resulting in a larger overlapping between drain current and drain voltage prejudicial for dissipated power and power added efficiency. In this paper we present a solution to maintain an appropriate gate source voltage shape. It consists in driving the gate of a power stage with an appropriate half sine voltage shape supplied by a driver stage operating at low drain bias voltage...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a strong}} desire for short {{wavelength}} (~ 1 Å), short pulsewidth (< 100 fs), high-brightness, transverse and longitudinally coherent light pulses {{for use by the}} synchrotron radiation community. These requirements exceed the limits achievable by existing, so-called, "third-generation" light sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), USA, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, and SPring- 8 in Harima Science Garden City, Japan. Single-pass, high-gain free-electron laser (FEL) methods have the ability to fulfill these requirements and have been proposed as the next-generation light source. Such arrangements include, but are not limited to, straight amplifier configurations, self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), the two-undulator <b>harmonic</b> generation <b>amplifier</b> scheme (TUHGS), and high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG). These single-pass, high-gain FELs typically employ planar undulators and can all generate nonlinear spectral harmonics with significant power levels. Of notable interest is the combination of the accelerator and traditional lasers, since existing laser technologies may be used for seeding the amplifier, TUHGS, and HGHG cases. This work examines single-pass, high-gain free-electron lasers analytically, via numerical simulations, and experimentally. An existing code, MEDUSA, was further developed to simulate relevant mechanisms as will be described. Along with a review of the respective theories, a three-step SASE FEL experiment at the APS, a two-step FEL experiment at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) involving both the SASE and HGHG methods, and the characteristics of nonlinear harmonic generation in both of these experiments are discussed. Finally, a modular approach to the next-generation light source is described. The above proof-of-principle experiments represent necessary steps toward achieving the next-generation light source. The ATF experiment tests the SASE and HGHG theories at a mid-infrared wavelength, while the APS experiment examines the SASE theory first at visible and then at ultraviolet wavelengths. The extension from the visible/ultraviolet wavelengths to the x-ray wavelength regime is not trivial, and there still remains much work before achieving the final goal based on the single-pass, high-gain free-electron laser theories and experiments. Of the topics elucidated within this manuscript, nonlinear harmonic generation in single-pass, high-gain FELs is perhaps the most significant. Although there is a reduction, compared to the fundamental wavelength, in the resultant output photon power when using the nonlinear harmonics to achieve shorter wavelengths, the harmonics do permit the use of an electron bunch of both lower energy and lesser quality. Therefore, smaller, less expensive machines could be developed, allowing many more facilities to be constructed and ultimately benefit from these bright, coherent, next-generation light sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in modern electronics pave way {{for new ways}} to design radar systems. The existence of Analogue to Digital Converters (ADC) capable of sampling at GHz make it possible to sample the RF signal directly, removing the need for prior down mixing. This gives a possibility to design very simple receiver channels and move traditional operations from hardware to software. This greatly helps cutting cost of manufacturing and development and opens up for a very configurable system. This configurability comes at the cost of decreased selectivity, resulting in that external signals outside the radar system's signal bandwidth but inside the receiver band will become amplified as well, with the risk of saturating the amplifiers. Because of this it is interesting to study the impact of the non-linearities on detectability. The simple design of the system makes it feasible to simulate the full system chain from transmitter to signal processing after the receiver. This thesis treats the methods used to create a model in order to simulate the operation and non-linear effects of a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) digital pulse doppler radar system from generation of transmission waveform to the signal processing of the sampled output from the receiver channels. The methods involve electronic simulations of amplifiers utilising a 5 th degree polynomial and filtering and sampling processes. The thesis further features techniques used to enhance the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of a desired signal from a phased array and position it in a 3 D space with 2 room dimensions and 1 velocity dimension. The model is then utilised to study the effects of non-linear effects of the system when the input to the receiver is disturbed by a strong clutter signal or a strong external signal. The thesis also treats the effect on detectability of a target when an external signal give rise to higher order <b>harmonics</b> from <b>amplifier</b> saturation and clipping during sampling that then is folded into the radar system's final sampling band. The thesis finds it feasible to perform full system simulations from waveform generation to detection and it is found that the non-linear effects due to strong disturbances negatively affect the desired target SNR and may in some cases be the source of false detections. The results is found by studying common radar cases, with varying input power to the receiver. The thesis finds {{that it is possible to}} digitally suppress external signals outside the final sampling band but the decrease in SNR for the desired signal, due to saturation of the radar system, still remains...|$|R
40|$|In this article, a new λ/ 4 bias line, {{combined}} with a dumbbell shaped defected ground structure (DGS), is proposed to suppress <b>harmonics</b> in power <b>amplifiers.</b> The proposed bias line maintains the required high impedance after the DGS is inserted, while the width and length of the λ/ 4 bias line are broader and shorter than those of conventional bias lines in power amplifiers. When the proposed bias line is used in power amplifiers, the third {{as well as the}} second harmonics are reduced because of the increased slow-wave effect of the proposed bias line over a wide harmonic frequency band. The proposed bias line is applied to a power amplifier for an IMT- 2000 base station. It is shown that the reduction of the third harmonic component and the improvements in the 1 dB power compression point, power-added efficiency and IMD 3 are 26. 5 dB, 0. 45 dB, 9. 1 percent and 4. 4 dB, respectively. Recently, extensive research efforts on photonic band gap (PBG) structures where periodic patterns are etched on the ground plane of microstrip lines have been conducted for microwave circuit applications. 1 – 4 The applications of PBG for power amplifiers, filters and mixers have been reported. A defected ground structure (DGS), which is realized by etching a few dumbbell shaped patterns in the ground plane of microstrip lines, has been proposed. 5 Several applications to the design of directional couplers, filters and power amplifiers using DGS have been already reported. 6 – 8 It is expected that DGSs can be applied effectively in microwave circuits to utilize their advantages over conventional PBGs. In general, small signal amplifiers at UHF use a chip inductor as an RF choke for bias. λ/ 4 transmission lines, terminated with chi...|$|R
