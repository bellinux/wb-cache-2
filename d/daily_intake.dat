5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism.

Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E
