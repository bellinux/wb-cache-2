5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight {{adjustments}} to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> abound. A flat fare that disregards {{distance}} has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{low-cost}} airlines have been created around the world. Legacy carriers used to apply revenue management (RM) to fully-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> with segmented demand. These low-fare competitors with simplified or unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> often manage to capture {{an important part of}} the demand in the markets they enter, forcing legacy carriers to change their <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> However, because of this change in <b>fare</b> <b>structures,</b> most RM forecasters and optimizers that were previously used by the legacy carriers are no longer effective. The goal of this thesis is to describe and test two RM methods based on dynamic programming in <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> with few or no restrictions. The first one, the "Lautenbacher" approach (DP-LB), was developed for fully-restricted environments but, when associated with an appropriate forecaster, may be used in less-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> The second one, the "Gallego-Van Ryzin" approach (DP-GVR), was developed for unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> In this thesis we describe these two methods, and analyze the performance of both in comparison with the performance of traditional RM methods used by legacy carriers, based on results obtained with the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulation (PODS). In our simulation DP-LB leads to results very close to those obtained with traditional RM methods. In unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> DP-GVR appeared to be theoretically appealing. The simulation results obtained with DP-GVR against a competitor using no RM or against a competitor using the same RM method were better than those obtained with other RM methods. But against advanced competitors, DP-GVR got worse results than other RM methods. (cont.) We showed that this variability in the performance of DP-GVR was related to its sensitivity to forecasts of probabilities of sell-up, forecasts that are difficult to estimate because they depend on the RM methods and actions of the competition. Further study with improved estimation of probabilities of sell-up will be required to determine whether this method can lead to stable improvement over traditional RM methods in unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> by Thierry Vanhaverbeke.

50|$|In North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, the {{majority}} of the cities use simple, flat rate <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> due to budgetary constraints. With {{the majority}} of North America, most of South America, almost all of Africa, and most of Oceania being heavily reliant on the automobile for both short and long distance travel, majority of the transit budgets are allocated toward construction and maintenance of freeways and roads, with very little funding making way to investments in new mass transit technologies. Inadvertently however, the reliance on simpler <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> due to their cheaper costs ends up increasing the tax burden on the agencies as flat rate <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> have lower farebox recovery ratios, placing more pressure to the transit agencies to increase taxes, pursue higher fare hikes, or to cut services to maintain the transit system.|$|R
5|$|The metro {{operates}} with a proof-of-payment system, so riders {{must have}} a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket machines are available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK24, and a three-zone ticket DKK36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing {{can be a bit}} confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin. Passengers must specify, on their ticket which sub-zone they wish to travel to.|$|E

40|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas where multi-modal trips are common, modeling transfers {{is an important}} issue. The existing approach of connecting multi-modal networks, without attending to the number or kinds of transfers, cannot fully describe actual behavior. In addition, the common practice of non-linear transit <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> imposes certain modeling difficulties on the assignment approach. In this study, we develop a formulation to overcome these two difficulties, namely the number and kinds of transfers are explicitly considered and non-linear <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> accommodated. Through a state augmentation technique, we transform a multi-modal network to one we call state-augmented multi-modal (SAM) network. Once formulated, the SAM network behaves like a simple network and can be combined with traffic assignment or network analysis procedures. A numerical example is provided to illustrate this approach.

40|$|In recent years, {{the airline}} {{industry}} has seen diminished performance of traditional Revenue Management (RM) systems {{largely due to the}} growth of Low Cost Carriers and the increased use of their "simplified" <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> With the removal of many of the fare restrictions essential to RM systems, standard demand forecasters can no longer segment demand and passengers are able to book air travel in fare classes lower than their actual willingness to pay. These "semi-restricted" <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> typically contain several homogenous fare classes undifferentiated except by price, as well as several distinct fare classes with unique combinations of booking restrictions and advance purchase requirements. This thesis describes" Hybrid Forecasting" (HF) [...] a new technique which separately forecasts "product-oriented" demand using traditional forecasting methods, and "price-oriented" demand for passengers who purchase only in the lowest priced fare class available when booking. The goal of this thesis is two-fold: to first measure the potential benefit of Hybrid Forecasting in terms of network revenue in semi-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures,</b> and then to measure potential improvements to Hybrid Forecasting. (cont.) "Path Categorization" attempts to improve revenues by exploiting the expected higher level of passenger willingness-to-pay for non-stop service versus connecting service. And "Fare Adjustment" accounts for passenger sell-up behavior from lower to higher fare classes, and is applied within an RM system's seat inventory optimizer. Experiments with the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator demonstrate that HF in these semi-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> can improve an airline's network revenue by approximately 3 % compared to traditional forecasting methods. This improvement grows by 0. 25 % with Path Categorization, by 1 % with Fare Adjustment, and by up to 2. 5 % over Hybrid Forecasting alone with Path Categorization and Fare Adjustment together [...] all significant impacts on an airline's network revenue. Though these results are encouraging, the revenue gains of these new RM forecasting methods are still not enough to offset the revenue loss associated with the easing of traditional fare class restrictions. by Michael H.
