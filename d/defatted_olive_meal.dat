40|$|Aim: Present study {{pertains}} to lime treatment of <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> {{to improve its}} digestibility. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the in vitro dry matter degradability of total mixed ration containing lime treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> at varied levels of maize replacement to know the optimum level of lime and treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> as maize replacement in small ruminant diets. Materials and methods: Study was carried out in two phases. In phase I, A complete diet was formulated and treated with lime at variable concentrations (0 - 8 %) at 25 % of maize replacement and subjected to in vitro studies as per Tilley and Terry. On the basis of the results of this phase, a concentration of lime for olive treatment was selected and tested at variable levels of maize replacement (0 - 50 %) by treated olive cake in phase II. Data was analyzed as per the procedures suggested by Snedecor and Cochran. Results: The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of composite diet increased from 43. 95 % at 0 % lime treatment to 48. 68 % on treating with 8 % lime with significant (P< 0. 05) increase at 6 % treatment level. Lime treatment beyond 6 % had no further significant effect on improving the digestibility. Graded levels of maize replacement by <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> treated with 6 % lime (lime percentage selected from phase I) showed that the in vitro digestibility of mixed ration was not compromised up to 40 % replacement level of maize by treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Improved digestibility with lime treatment may be due to weakening of internal Hydrogen bonding, thereby disrupting the fiber structure in <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Further lime may be saponifying the high level of fat present in <b>olive</b> <b>meal,</b> which may otherwise negatively impact the digestibility values. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the treatment with up to 6 % of lime can effectively increase the digestibility of <b>olive</b> <b>meal.</b> Treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> can replace up to 40 % of maize from daily ration without affecting the digestibility of composite ration. Thus incorporating lime treated <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> may prove beneficial to livestock producers. [Vet World 2013; 6 (7. 000) : 440 - 443...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which high-fat, high-cholesterol diets lower serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) concentration was studied in rats by feeding a single high-fat, high-cholesterol meal and by intravenously infusing chylomicrons containing low and high amounts of cholesterol. Serum apoE concentrations were unchanged 9 hours after an <b>olive</b> oil <b>meal</b> but were decreased by 35 % after an <b>olive</b> oil/cholesterol-enriched <b>meal.</b> The decrease in serum apoE concentrations with the <b>olive</b> oil/cholesterol <b>meal</b> {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in apoE concentration in the high density lipoprotein fraction. Three hours after the intravenous infusion of cholesterol-enriched chylomicrons, serum apoE concentrations decreased 40 %, whereas serum apoE concentrations decreased by only 10 % when chylomicrons with low cholesterol concentrations or saline were infused. It is concluded that the metabolism of cholesterol-enriched chylomicrons results in an increased removal of serum apoE and that the cholesterol content of chylomicrons is a determinant of serum apoE removal...|$|R

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of replacing 50 % of BH of rabbit ration formulation by alternative sources of agriculture by-products such as MBH, SBVH, or PVH. The present results of Table  3 in agreement with those found by Asar et al. (2010) who noted that digestion coefficients of (DM, OM, CP, EE, and NFE), TDN and DCP were improved by replacing barley with alfalfa hay, Berseem hay, or dried Faba bean straw each at 25 % as a fiber source for rabbits fed rations contained 30 % corn-cob meal. On the other hand, Ghazalah and El-Shahat (1994) showed that inclusion of <b>olive</b> <b>meal</b> instead of barley increased OM digestibility. Also, Salwa et al. (2000), Falcão-e-Cunha et al. (2004), and Sarhan (2005) noticed that inclusion of agriculture by-products in rabbit rations improved EE digestibility. Also, Omer and Badr (2013) found that OM, CF, EE, and NFE digestibilities were significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) improved with replacement Berseem hay by pea straw in rations at different levels of replacement (0, 25, 75, and 100 %). Also, feeding 30 % pea pods hulls diet had better nutritive value compared to control (Sarhan 2005). Meanwhile, Myrie et al. (2008) showed that most feedstuffs contain anti-nutritional factors such as insoluble fibers, ligins, tannins and lectins, intake of these anti-nutritional factors reduced nutrient digestibility and increased endogenous protein losses, through increasing of intestinal mucus secretion.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{investigated}} the postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function, which may be an atherogenic factor. BACKGROUNDThe Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, pasta, fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine, is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that a Mediterranean diet, which substituted omega- 3 -fatty-acid-enriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega- 9 fatty-acid-rich olive oil, reduced cardiovascular events. METHODSWe fed 10 healthy, normolipidemic subjects five meals containing 900 kcal and 50 g fat. Three meals contained different fat sources: olive oil, canola oil, and salmon. Two <b>olive</b> oil <b>meals</b> also contained antioxidant vitamins (C and E) or foods (balsamic vinegar and salad). We measured serum lipoproteins and glucose and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), an index of endothelial function, before and 3 h after each meal. RESULTSAll five meals significantly raised serum triglycerides, but did not change other lipoproteins or glucose 3 h postprandially. The <b>olive</b> oil <b>meal</b> reduced FMD 31 % (14. 3 ± 4. 2 % to 9. 9 ± 4. 5 %, p = 0. 008). An inverse correlation was observed between postprandial changes in serum triglycerides and FMD (r = − 0. 47, p < 0. 05). The remaining four meals did not significantly reduce FMD. CONCLUSIONSIn terms of their postprandial effect on endothelial function, the beneficial components of the Mediterranean and Lyon Diet Heart Study diets appear to be antioxidant-rich foods, including vegetables, fruits, and their derivatives such as vinegar, and omega- 3 -rich fish and canola oils...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Postprandial lipaemia {{varies with}} gender and the {{composition}} of dietary fat due to the partitioning of fatty acids between beta-oxidation and incorporation into triacylglycerols (TAGs). Increasing evidence {{highlights the importance of}} postprandial measurements to evaluate atherogenic risk. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in women are poorly characterized. We therefore studied the postprandial lipid response of women to an ALA-rich oil in comparison with olive oil and butter, and characterized the fatty acid composition of total lipids, TAGs, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in plasma. Methods A randomized crossover design (n = 19) was used to compare the postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g fat. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for 7 h. Statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA (significant difference = P Results No significant difference was seen in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) plasma-TAG between the meals. ALA and oleic acid levels were significantly increased in plasma after ALA-rich oil and <b>olive</b> oil <b>meals,</b> respectively. Palmitic acid was significantly increased in plasma-TAG after the butter meal. The ratios of 18 : 2 n- 6 to 18 : 3 n- 3 in plasma-TAGs, three and seven hours after the ALA-rich oil meal, were 1. 5 and 2. 4, respectively. The corresponding values after the <b>olive</b> oil <b>meal</b> were: 13. 8 and 16. 9; and after the butter meal: 9. 0 and 11. 6. Conclusions The postprandial p-TAG and NEFA response in healthy pre-menopausal women was not significantly different after the intake of an ALA-rich oil, olive oil and butter. The ALA-rich oil significantly affected different plasma lipid fractions and improved the ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 fatty acids several hours postprandially. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} single dose of tomato sauce on healthy male volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Healthy male subjects (n = 10) were enrolled. Placebo (rice and olive oil) or tomato (tomato sauce, rice and <b>olive</b> oil) <b>meals</b> were provided to the volunteers. Blood and urine samples were taken before consumption of meal (0 h) and 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 h after meal. Consumption of tomato sauce increased plasma lycopene level by 5 - 22 %, with a maximum level at 24 h (p < 0. 01) after the meal. Levels of plasma F 2 -isoprostanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid products, allantoin and urinary 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine did not change after either meal, but urinary F 2 -isoprostanes (p < 0. 05) significantly decreased at 48 h compared to 0 h after the tomato sauce meal.

40|$|Fruits of Olea europaea L. {{have been}} used for centuries in folk {{medicine}} to treat many inflammatory diseases. In order to evaluate the anti-nociceptive activities of the methanolic and aqueous extracts of defatted fruits of O. europaea, formalin test was used and for evaluation of anti-inflammatory effects of the extract, the volume of paw edema was measured. The results revealed that both extracts did not exhibit significant analgesic activity in the first phase of formalin test, whereas methanolic extract at the 600 mg/Kg dose and aqueous extract at the 450 and 600 mg/Kg doses could inhibit induced pain in the second phase of formalin test. Furthermore, the results of paw edema volume measurement indicated that the aqueous extract has anti-inflammatory effects at dose of 600 mg/Kg. Induced anti-nociception by aqueous olive extract was not reversed by naloxone, which indicates that the opioid receptors are not involved in the analgesic effects of the extracts.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether the addition of walnuts or olive oil to a fatty meal have differential effects on postprandial vasoactivity, lipoproteins, markers of oxidation and endothelial activation, and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). BackgroundCompared with a Mediterranean diet, a walnut diet {{has been shown to}} improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients. We hypothesized that walnuts would reverse postprandial endothelial dysfunction associated with consumption of a fatty meal. MethodsWe randomized in a crossover design 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with hypercholesterolemia to 2 high-fat meal sequences to which 25 g olive oil or 40 g walnuts had been added. Both test meals contained 80 g fat and 35 % saturated fatty acids, and consumption of each meal was separated by 1 week. Venipunctures and ultrasound measurements of brachial artery endothelial function were performed after fasting and 4 h after test meals. ResultsIn both study groups, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was worse after the <b>olive</b> oil <b>meal</b> than after the walnut meal (p = 0. 006, time-period interaction). Fasting, but not postprandial, triglyceride concentrations correlated inversely with FMD (r = − 0. 324; p = 0. 024). Flow-independent dilation and plasma ADMA concentrations were unchanged, and the concentration of oxidized low-density lipoproteins decreased (p = 0. 051) after either meal. The plasma concentrations of soluble inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules decreased (p < 0. 01) independently of meal type, except for E-selectin, which decreased more (p = 0. 033) after the walnut meal. ConclusionsAdding walnuts to a high-fat meal acutely improves FMD independently of changes in oxidation, inflammation, or ADMA. Both walnuts and olive oil preserve the protective phenotype of endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Fat {{is often}} {{included}} in common foods as an emulsion of dispersed oil droplets {{to enhance the}} organoleptic quality and stability. The intragastric acid stability of emulsified fat may impact on gastric emptying, satiety and plasma lipid absorption. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether, compared with an acid-unstable emulsion, an acid-stable fat emulsion would empty from the stomach more slowly, cause more rapid plasma lipid absorption and cause greater satiety. Eleven healthy male volunteers received on two separate occasions 500 ml of 15 % (w/w) [13 C]palmitate-enriched <b>olive</b> oil-in-water emulsion <b>meals</b> which were either stable or unstable in the acid gastric environment. MRI was used to measure gastric emptying and the intragastric oil fraction of the meals. Blood sampling was used to measure plasma lipids and visual analogue scales were used to assess satiety. The acid-unstable fat emulsion broke and rapidly layered in the stomach. Gastric emptying of meal volume was slower for the acid-stable fat emulsion (P, 0 · 0001; two-way ANOVA). The rate of energy delivery of fat from the stomach to the duodenum was not different up to t ¼ 110 min. The acid-stable emulsion induced increased fullness (P, 0 · 05), decreased hunger (P, 0 · 0002), decreased appetite (P, 0 · 0001) and increased the concentration of palmitic acid tracer in the chylomicron fraction (P, 0 · 04). This shows that it is possible to delay gastric emptying and increase satiety by stabilising the intragastric distribution of fat emulsions against the gastric acid environment. This could have implications for the design of novel foods...|$|R
50|$|The cuisine of the Ottoman Empire, which {{incorporated}} Palestine {{as one of}} its provinces between 1512 and 1514, {{was partially}} made up of what had become by then a rich Arab cuisine. After the Crimean War, many foreign communities (namely the Bosnians, Greeks, French and Italians) began settling in the area; Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem were the most popular destinations for these groups. The cuisine of these communities, particularly those of the Balkans, contributed to the character of Palestinian cuisine. Nonetheless, until the 1950s and 1960s, the staple diet for many rural Palestinian families revolved around olive oil, oregano (za'atar) and bread, baked in a simple oven called a taboon.Palestinian cuisine is divided into three regional groups: the Galilee, West Bank and Gaza area. Cuisine in the Galilee region shares much in common with Lebanese cuisine, due to extensive communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. Galilee inhabitants specialize in producing a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kibbee by Arabs. Kibbee has several variations including it being served raw, fried or baked. Musakhan is a common main dish that originated in the Jenin and Tulkarm areas of the northern West Bank. It consists of a roasted chicken over a taboon bread that has been topped with pieces of fried sweet onions, sumac, allspice and pine nuts, cooked and finished with a generous helping of <b>olive</b> oil. Other <b>meals</b> common to the area are maqluba and mansaf, the latter originating from the Bedouin population of Jordan.|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of the diet of seven free-living subjects (five men and two women) aged 41 – 56 years was altered for 1 month. The aim was to increase the intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) from subjects current habitual levels of 12 % dietary energy to a target intake of 18 % dietary energy, and to decrease saturated fatty acid (SFA) from habitual levels of 16 % dietary energy to target levels of 10 % dietary energy. The change in fatty acid intake was achieved by supplying volunteers with foods prepared using MUFA-containing spreads or <b>olive</b> oil (ready <b>meals,</b> sweet biscuits and cakes) and also by supplying spreads, cooking oil and MUFA-enriched milk for domestic use. Body weight and plasma total cholesterol measurements were made at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks on the diet {{as an aid to}} maintaining subject compliance. MUFA consumption was significantly increased from 12 % dietary energy to 16 % dietary energy (P< 0. 01), and SFA intake was reduced from 16 % dietary energy to 6 % dietary energy (P< 0. 01) during the 4 -week intervention. The diet failed to achieve the target increase in MUFA but exceeded the target reduction in SFA. This was {{due to the fact that}} subjects reduced their total fat intake from a mean habitual level of 38 % dietary energy to a mean level of 30 % dietary energy. During the dietary period, mean plasma cholesterol levels were lower at 2 weeks (P< 0. 01) and at 4 weeks (P< 0. 01) than the baseline, with a mean reduction of 20 % over the dietary period. This study demonstrates the difficulty of achieving increased MUFA intakes (by SFA substitution) in free-living populations when only a limited range of fatty-acid modified food products are provided to volunteers...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{indicator of}} the metabolic capacity of humans {{is the ability to}} regulate plasma triacylglycerol levels and to clear triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) from the circulation after a meal. This is crucial since most of the day is spent in the postprandial state. High concentrations and long circulation times of TRL remnants may be detrimental since these are considered to be highly atherogenic. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in men and women are poorly characterized. A new ALA-rich oil was produced from rapeseed and linseed oil by enzymatic interesterification. The postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g of this new ALA-rich oil, olive oil, or butter were compared in two randomized crossover studies (26 men and 19 premenopausal women). Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals up to 7 h after the meals. We hypothesized that the postprandial lipid response might be attenuated by a preferential oxidation of ALA compared to other long chain dietary fatty acids. Premenopausal women showed lower postprandial lipemia and were less sensitive to variations in dietary fat than men. Butter resulted in lower postprandial lipemia than the oils in men, whereas no such difference was seen in the women. The ALA oil and <b>olive</b> oil <b>meals</b> induced similar plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Women showed significantly lower NEFA responses after the olive oil and butter meals than men. The ALA-rich oil had significant effects on the different plasma lipid fractions and decreased the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in plasma several hours postprandially. ALA levels remained high in plasma triacylglycerols and NEFA even after 5 - 7 h. This late high concentration of ALA in NEFA is indicative of spill-over NEFA and/or preferential release of ALA by the adipose tissue into the circulation. In summary we did thus not find evidence that ALA has a beneficial effect on postprandial lipids by a selective partitioning to oxidation. This does not exclude the possibility that ALA over a longer time period may have health effects not only as precursor of longer chain n- 3 fatty, primarily docosahexaenoic acid, but also because it is sorted out for oxidation. The enzymatic interesterification of triacylglycerols using immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) as catalyst has also been investigated. Three different reaction systems were studied: rapeseed oil + butter, rapeseed oil + linseed oil (ALA oil), and trilaurin + 1, 3 -palmitin- 2 -olein. The ALA oil (35 % ALA) was the same as that used in the meal studies. All reactions were followed by reversed-phase HPLC and the triacylglycerol peaks were tentatively identified by calculating equivalent carbon numbers. The triacylglycerols in the rapeseed oil + butter mixture and products were also identified by HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In ideal sn- 1, 3 -specific lipase-catalyzed interesterification, the fatty acid composition in the sn- 2 position remains constant. In practice, however, slight changes are observed in the sn- 2 position and, under certain conditions, a completely randomized fatty acid distribution can be obtained. Randomization is slower than interesterification. Uncontrolled hydrolysis should, however, be avoided as it lowers the TAG yield. Different triacylglycerol mixtures, i. e. products originating from 1, 3 -specific interesterification as well as totally or partially randomized products, can be produced by varying the reaction time. Enzymatic interesterification {{could be used as a}} method of designing dietary oils with new properties regarding fatty acid composition, susceptibility to oxidation and effects on blood lipids. The future of enzymatic processes relies on efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use systems that ensure high stability of the enzyme preparation and stable output of high-quality products at a reasonable cost...|$|R
