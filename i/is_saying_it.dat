500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They have no reason to worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E

Perusing his note of dissent, President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury asked the Education Minister to convince Prime Minister about Khan's points. In this connection, Dr. Khan said, [...] "Every time I did not like or felt something that was against the law, I gave written notes, and in most cases, my experience <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> {{was bound to be}} accepted".|$|E

6000|$|Here {{is a form}} of {{introduction}} cruelly familiar to those who know it. It is used by the sour-looking villain facetiously called in newspaper reports the [...] "genial chairman" [...] of the meeting.

6000|$|She {{remained}} with her eyelids dropped in an absent survey of her sewing, while Mrs. Bowen regarded {{her with a}} look of vexation, impatience, resentment, on the last refinement of these emotions, which she banished from her face before Miss Graham looked up and said, with a smile [...] "How funny it is to see Effie's infatuation with him! She can't take her eyes off him for a moment, and she follows him round the room so as not to lose a word he <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>It</b> was heroic of her to go to bed without a murmur before he left to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|We are, in fact, {{much more}} {{exacting}} than the English {{in matters of}} English state; we, who have no state at all require them {{to live up to}} theirs, just as quite plain, elderly observers expect every woman to be young and pretty, and take it hard when she is not. But possibly the secret of enduring so much state as the English have lies in knowing how and when to shirk it, to drop it. No doubt, the alien who counted upon this fact, if it is a fact, would find his knuckles warningly rapped when he reached too confidingly through air that seemed empty of etiquette. But the rapping would be very gentle, very kindly, for this is the genius of English rule where it is not concerned with criminal offence. You must keep off wellnigh all the grass on the island, but you are [...] "requested" [...] to keep off it, and not forbidden in the harsh imperatives of our brief authorities. It is again the difference between the social and the public, which is perhaps the main difference between an oligarchy and a democracy. The sensibilities are more spared in the one and the self-respect in the other, though this <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> too loosely, and may not be saying it truly; it is only a conjecture with which I am parleying while I am getting round to add that such part of the levee as I saw in plain day, though there was vastly more of it, was much less filling to the imagination than a glimpse which I had of a court one night. I am rather proud of being able to explain that the late queen held court in the early afternoon and the present king holds court at night; but, lest any envious reader suspect me of knowing the fact at first-hand, I hasten to say that the glimpse I had of the function that night only revealed to me in my cab a royal coach driving out of a palace gate, and showing larger than human, through a thin rain, the blood-red figures of the coachmen and footmen gowned from head to foot in their ensanguined colors, with the black-gleaming body of the coach between them, and the horses trampling heraldically before out of the legendary past. The want of definition in the fact, which I beheld in softly blurred outline, enhanced its value, which was so supreme that I could not perhaps do justice to the vague splendors of inferior courtward equipages, as my cab flashed by them, moving in a slow line towards the front of Buckingham Palace.|$|E

5000|$|Conservative {{commentator}} Charles Krauthammer {{brought the}} term up {{in a discussion}} about President Obama on the show Fox News All-Stars in June 2010, saying: What we see here is conditional truthiness.

50|$|Montages in documentaries {{are usually}} linked with words that {{characters}} say.

50|$|Traditional {{conferencing}} software uses {{a single}} microphone that loses location information, mixing all the sounds.

5000|$|Edmund Wilson, {{writing in}} The New Republic in 1924, spoke without pretence for most readers of Stevens: [...] "Even {{when you do}} not know what he is saying, you know that he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> well". This 'Wilson effect' is no doubt linked to Stevens' Adagia aphorism, [...] "Poetry must resist the {{intelligence}} almost successfully". [...] "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt" [...] is a good candidate for a Wilson award.|$|E
5000|$|Optimal {{establishment}} of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on {{the context of the}} delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than what is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical [...] "Western" [...] countries.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Virgin Carrying a Lantern" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium (1923). It {{was one of}} the few Harmonium poems first {{published}} in that volume, so it is still under copyright. However, it is quoted here as justified by fair use to facilitate scholarly commentary. There are no bears among the roses,Only a negress who supposesThings false and wrongAbout the lantern of the beautyWho walks, there, as a farewell duty,Walks long and long.The pity that her pious egressShould fill the vigil of a negressWith heat so strong! This poem illustrates Edmund Wilson's maxim about reading Stevens, that even when you do not know what he is saying, you know that he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> well. It also illustrates a variant, that even when you have qualms about what he is saying, you know that he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> well. The image of the virgin carrying a lantern is crisp, contributing to a well wrought miniature. The role for the negress may be a racist stereotype. It is certainly more likely to be seen as such today than in 1923. Stevens surely meant it to be a playful poem, as the facile rhyme indicates.|$|E
50|$|Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle {{describes}} {{the use of}} speech recognition technology {{in the service of}} tyranny.

It also record the time it takes for a driver to respond in the conversation and from that determine if the driver is nodding off or being distracted by something.|$|E
