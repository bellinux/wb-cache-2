40|$|As the {{friction}} material degradation progresses, the normal contact stiffness of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches,</b> {{measured in the}} pre-sliding (stiction) regime that corresponds to the post-lockup phase, changes as revealed in our previous study. Consequently, change of the contact stiffness can affect the normal-mode dynamic behavior. If this hypothesis holds, condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> can also be monitored based on the change of the normal-mode dynamic behavior. In order to verify the hypothesis, in this study, accelerated lifetime tests (ALTs) were carried out on two paper-based wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> under different operations using an SAE# 2 test setup. The normal-mode vibration signal is measured every 200 duty cycles by using an accelerometer axially mounted on the bearing housing of the clutch. Three parameters that implicitly quantify the overall dynamic behavior, i. e., frequency centre (FC), root mean square frequency (RMSF), and root variance frequency (RVF), are extracted from the vibration signal measured in the post-lockup phase. The plots of these three parameters in function of the duty cycles exhibit clear trends which indicate {{the progress of the}} clutch degradation. These three parameters can therefore be seen as the important ones that may allow us to assess the condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> play a {{critical}} role in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions. It is unavoidable that they progressively degrade and eventually break down while the vehicles are under operational condition. To avoid unexpected failures, a proper condition monitoring tool extended with a lifetime prediction method should be implemented. In order to achieve this, appropriate parameters delivering any information about the failure modes and levels must be determined. This paper presents an experimental investigation on a set of statistical parameters generated from the zeroth- and first-order derivative of time domain pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, to determine the appropriate parameters, often called relevant features, for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> The torsional vibrations are measured by using two Ferraris sensors installed on both input and output shaft of the clutch. The determination of the relevant features is based on an evaluation of the historical trends of the parameters. Clearness and fluctuation level of the historical trends are considered as criteria for selecting relevant features from the generated statistical parameters. The trends of the parameters are extracted from lifetime data obtained from an accelerated lifetime test on a paper-based wet clutch, using a SAE# 2 test setup. This study reveals that the RMS value and Shannon entropy extracted from the first-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, and the kurtosis extracted from the zeroth-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, can be used as relevant features for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a condition monitoring method for wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> based on monitoring the change of the relative velocity signal measured between the input and output shaft of the clutch. To quantify the change of the signal, the engagement duration and two dissimilarity measures, namely the Euclidian and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance are proposed here. Service-life data obtained from Accelerated Lifetime Tests (ALTs), carried out using an SAE# 2 test setup, are recorded and analyzed to extract the proposed features; then to justify the potential and the relevance of the features for the clutch condition monitoring. The plots of the features extracted from the relative velocity signal in function of the service-life of the tested clutches exhibit clear trends that can be associated with the progress of the clutches degradation. Remarkably, all the trends are linearly increasing with relatively small variations.

40|$|Wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> are machine {{elements}} enabling the power transmission from {{an input shaft}} to an output shaft during the operation, based on the friction occurring in lubricated contacting surfaces. These components {{play a critical role}} in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, power shift transmissions and limited slip differentials. An unexpected failure occurring in clutches can lead to an unexpected total breakdown of the vehicle. This undesirable situation can put human safety at risk, possibly cause long-term vehicle down times, and eventually result in high maintenance costs. In order to minimize the negative impacts, an optimal maintenance strategy, i. e. a condition based maintenance (CBM), driven by an accurate condition monitoring and prognostics therefore needs to be developed and implemented for wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> A literature study has been carried out during this work in order to establish the state-of-the-art development of clutch monitoring and prognostics systems. Despite the fact that the performance demands for clutches increase, research in this direction is apparently very limited. Several methods related to this aspect have been reported in literature, but, they are not sufficiently pragmatic and flexible to implement for real-life applications. To fill this substantial gap, development of a clutch monitoring and prognostics method that can be easily implemented on real-life applications is the main objective of this thesis. There are two main failure modes that can interrupt the functionality of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> as reported in the literature, namely (i) lubricant and (ii) friction material degradations. This thesis mainly focuses on the failure of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> caused by the friction material degradation, which is a valid assumption for heavy-duty applications. In this scope, a better understanding of how friction material degradation affects the clutch dynamic behavior during its operation is of paramount importance for developing an effective clutch monitoring and prognostics system. In the first place, this thesis contributes to the contact modeling of nominally flat rough surfaces with asymmetric asperity heights distribution, which is relevant for clutch contact problems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> characteristics is established that leads to the derivation of a friction model appropriate for clutches, wherein some considerably important friction phenomena are taken into account. Subsequently, the effects of two major friction material degradation mechanisms, namely (i) adhesive wear and (ii) thermal degradation, on the <b>clutch</b> contact and <b>friction</b> characteristics are theoretically and experimentally investigated, which is the second contribution of this thesis. A novel experimental procedure, which is the third contribution, is proposed in order to systematically evaluate how the sliding friction characteristics of a clutch evolve during the lifetime. This way, the evolution of the frictionmodel parameters can be observed and quantified. A knowledge gained from the aforementioned evolution motivates to model and simulate the dynamic responses of a degrading clutch system. Based on the simulation results, some measurable ``features'' representing the progression of the <b>clutch</b> <b>friction</b> material degradation are derived, which is the fourth contribution. A feasibility study on the derived features recommends to develop two clutch monitoring methods: i. e. (a) post-lockup-features-based method and (b) pre-lockup-features-based method. In the first monitoring method, which is the fifth contribution, the torsional natural frequency and the corresponding damping extracted from the post-lockup torsional vibration signals are proposed as relevant features. The second monitoring method, which is the sixth contribution, utilizes the relative velocity signals of interest for extracting the relevant features, i. e. (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance. In order to evaluate and verify the developed monitoring methods, accelerated life tests (ALTs) were carried out on some commercial wet clutches using a fully instrumented SAE # 2 test setup which is designed by an industrial partner, Dana-Spicer Off Highway Belgium. The experimental results confirm that the developed monitoring methods are feasible to be used for practical applications. As the last contribution, a data-driven health assessment and prognostics method which can be used to assess the condition and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> is developed. This strategy has been successfully evaluated and verified on some commercially available wet clutches. The evaluation and verification show that the developed strategy is prospective for aiding a condition based maintenance for wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|R
