500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not <b>feel</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> and in order to feel safe.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{describes}} New Labour {{as being}} formed by struggles in the 1980s and a programme of [...] "social liberalism, egalitarian {{education and the}} sexual revolution" [...] envisaged in the 1950s by figures such as Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins. He believes that its beliefs are Eurocommunist, and has criticised Labour for its [...] "attacks on the constitution", describing Tony Blair's constitutional reforms as a [...] "slow-motion coup d'état". [...] Hitchens believes the most significant changes introduced by New Labour concentrated {{power in the hands}} of the executive, with Blair effectively chief executive, and Orders in Council installing Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell in Whitehall. Hitchens also mocked Blair's public relations, previously calling him [...] "Princess Tony" [...] (in reference to Blair's calling Princess Diana [...] "the people's princess"), and [...] "Anthony Blair", as well as casting doubt on Blair's accounts of his early legal and political career. Hitchens also described Gordon Brown, as a [...] "dismal Marxoid", but criticised what he saw as [...] "prejudiced, shallow" [...] attempts by the media to destroy Brown after he became Prime Minister. However, Hitchens has shown some sympathy for Jeremy Corbyn, writing that the Labour leader [...] "speaks for a lot of people who <b>feel</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the recovery we are supposed to be having" [...] and who represents a split from [...] "the same cult, the Clinton-Blair fantasy that globalism ... will save the great nations of the West", likening him to Donald Trump in his anti-Establishment rhetoric.|$|E

60|$|In that elect company I was silent, {{partly because}} I was {{conscious}} of my youthful inadequacy, and partly because I preferred to listen. But Longfellow always behaved as if I were saying a succession of edifying and delightful things, {{and from time to}} time he addressed himself to me, so that I should not <b>feel</b> <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> He did not talk much himself, and I recall nothing that he said. But he always spoke both wisely and simply, without the least touch of pose, and with no intention of effect, but with something that I must call quality for want of a better word; so that at a table where Holmes sparkled, and Lowell glowed, and Agassiz beamed, he cast the light of a gentle gaiety, which seemed to dim all these vivider luminaries. While he spoke you did not miss Fields's story or Tom Appleton's wit, or even the gracious amity of Mr. Norton, with his unequalled intuitions.|$|E
