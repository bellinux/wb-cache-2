The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{compelling}} evidence suggests a role of vitamin D deficiency in {{the pathogenesis of}} insulin resistance and insulin secretion derangements, with a consequent possible interference with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of this link is incompletely understood. In fact, vitamin D deficiency is usually detected in obesity in which insulin resistance is also a common finding. The coexistence of insulin resistance and vitamin D deficiency has generated several hypotheses. Some cross-sectional and prospective {{studies have suggested that}} vitamin D deficiency {{may play a role in}} worsening insulin resistance; others have identified obesity as a risk factor predisposing individuals to exhibit both vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance. The available data from intervention studies are largely confounded, and <b>inadequate</b> <b>considerations</b> of seasonal effects on 25 (OH) D concentrations are also a common design flaw in many studies. On the contrary, there is strong evidence that obesity might cause both vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance, leaving open the possibility that vitamin D and diabetes are not related at all. Although it might seem premature to draw firm conclusions on the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing insulin resistance and preventing type 2 diabetes, this manuscript will review the circumstances leading to vitamin D deficiency and how such a deficiency can eventually independently affect insulin sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{engineering}} systems {{often require}} dynamic coordination of multidisciplinary teams with conflicting objectives. Failing {{to understand the}} complex relationships among the conflicting objectives may result in serious engineering failures. In engineering education, {{one of the challenges}} in teaching complex systems is the lack of effective tools to demonstrate system dynamics, especially spatial-temporal relationships in the system. The described project in this paper is supported by grants from Engineering Education program of the National Science Foundation. In the project civil/construction engineering cases are used as the context to test the proposed new teaching/learning tool on the subject and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tool. In building system design, structural designs mainly focus on the behavior of structures under design loads specified for operating stage. Typically less attention is given to the dynamic transient load during various construction stages. The insufficient considerations of the construction related transient loads may reach the critical point during construction and cause structural failure. For example, there were cases of bridge collapse during construction due to <b>inadequate</b> <b>considerations</b> of the load dynamics during construction. Also, many factors affecting construction transient loads were not technical. Rather, they are management related such as construction sequence and cost considerations. Thus, enabling construction students to learn from the similar cases through effective media is critical to avoid repeating the mistakes...|$|R

Current design criteria generally consider significant wave heights less than 11 meters (36 feet).

40|$|Background: Despite the {{importance}} of an effective health system response to various disasters, relevant research {{is still in its}} infancy, especially in middle- and low-income countries. Objective: This paper provides an overview of the status of disaster health management in China, with its aim to promote the effectiveness of the health response for reducing disaster-related mortality and morbidity. Design: A scoping review method was used to address the recent progress of and challenges to disaster health management in China. Major health electronic databases were searched to identify English and Chinese literature that were relevant to the research aims. Results: The review found that since 2003 considerable progress has been achieved in the health disaster response system in China. However, there remain challenges that hinder effective health disaster responses, including low standards of disaster-resistant infrastructure safety, the lack of specific disaster plans, poor emergency coordination between hospitals, lack of portable diagnostic equipment and underdeveloped triage skills, surge capacity, and psychological interventions. Additional challenges include the fragmentation of the emergency health service system, a lack of specific legislation for emergencies, disparities in the distribution of funding, and <b>inadequate</b> cost-effective <b>considerations</b> for disaster rescue. Conclusions: One solution identified to address these challenges appears to be through corresponding policy strategies at multiple levels (e. g. community, hospital, and healthcare system level) ...|$|R
40|$|Display {{adaptation}} {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} for the success of visual services.

A number of S 3 D displays are available in the market and they have various screen dimensions. As we have more varieties of the displays, efficient S 3 D image resizing is becoming more emphasized. We present the conditions for equi-proportional S 3 D image resizing using the model of the binocular vision; and propose an anti-aliasing filter for stereoscopic 3 D image up/down-sampling...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} of structures is one of primary concerns in the engineering industry. Poor durability in design {{may result in a}} structure losing its performance to the extent where structural integrity is no longer satisfied and human lives are at stake. Moreover, the associated costs of maintenance and repair due to <b>inadequate</b> design <b>considerations</b> are high. Thus, designing for durable structures not only helps sustain our infrastructure, it also reduces future costs. This thesis identifies the key factors that define and impact durability, with particular attention paid to the effect of material choice on overall durability. This follows a study of the different deteriorating mechanisms that wood, steel and reinforced concrete undergo over time, and the different enhancement techniques used to reduce the adverse effects of these mechanisms. Finally, a comparison study is carried out comparing the different material properties of wood, steel and concrete and the effect of using alternative materials on cost and quantity of material used. This further enhances the understanding of the impact that the design choices make, during {{the early stages of the}} project, on the overall {{durability of}} the structure.

40|$|The {{population}} growth living {{in urban areas}} reaches 50 % of the total, causing polluting air and energy consumption, also due to the high density of urban activities. This gradual process of urbanization which covers an area equal to 2 % {{of the world is}} responsible for about 75 % of the total consumption of resources. Although cities are the place where there is a wide concentration of energy demand and consumption, the attention given to the implications of this phenomenon is still <b>inadequate.</b> These <b>considerations</b> allow to perceive that such things require a broader strategy to solve the problem, based on the integration of urban, transport and environment policies for a sustainable development.

40|$|Abstract]: We {{applied a}} {{multi-purpose}} three-dimensional ocean general circulation model to compute water renewal time scales {{for a large}} coastal embayment situated off the central eastern coast of Australia (Hervey Bay) that shows features of an inverse estuary. Water renewal or ventilation time scales are not directly observable but can easily be diagnosed from numerical simulations. Improved knowledge of these time scales can assists in evaluating the water quality of coastal environments and can be utilised in sustainable marine resource management. The numerical studies are performed with the COupled Hydrodynamical Ecological model for REgioNal Shelf seas (COHERENS). The model, adopted for Hervey Bay, provided insight into ventilation pathways, and renewal time scales were found to exhibit a strong spatial variability. More than 80 % of the coastal embayment was fully ventilated after about 70 - 100 days, with the eastern and western shallow coastal regions ventilated more rapidly than the central, deeper part of the bay. The concept of a single ’typical’ ventilation timescale characterising this particular coastal embayment is <b>inadequate</b> and the <b>consideration</b> of spatial variability is clearly important, hence in {{a second set of}} simulations local monitoring boxes and Lagrangian tracers have been used to focus on this spatial variability. Simple parameters are derived to estimate local sedimentation, transport processes or places of high/low biological production...|$|R
30|$|To illustrate, for the {{currently}} configured tutoring response strategy rules, the ATS upon detecting {{that the students}} are frustrated, will initiate the display of prompts on screen to remind the students that they can request for hints to resolve the errors. For the version of ATS that was deployed for the trial, these prompts are faded in {{from the side of}} the screen and automatically faded out after 8  s. Our design consideration is that the prompts should not be disruptive to the students. In a study by Robison, McQuiggan, and Lester (2009), they concluded that the risk of students reacting negatively to incorrect affective interventions may be high for some affective states and caution should be exercised to avoid unintended effects of <b>inadequate</b> interventions. In <b>consideration</b> of these, we adopted a less disruptive and non-interruptive way of displaying the reminder prompts where students do not have to click on a button to close the prompt. At any instance, the students can also request for hints on their own without the reminder message by clicking on the request for hint button. If the students did not request for hints for 10  s after the system detected that they are frustrated, the system will fade in an empathetic message encouraging the students to continue resolving the errors on their own. This would be an appraisal-focused response (Weiten et al., 2011) that alleviates the frustration by diverting their attention away from the negative affect itself.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} outcome of 100 general {{practice}} based, multicentre research projects submitted to the ethics committee of the Royal College of General Practitioners by pharmaceutical companies or their agents between 1984 and 1989. DESIGN: Analysis of consecutive submitted protocols for stated objectives, study design, and outcomes; detailed review of committee minutes and correspondence in relation to amendment and approval; assessment of final reports submitted at conclusion of studies. SUBJECTS: 82 finally approved protocols, embracing 34, 523 proposed trial subjects and 1195 proposed general practice investigators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success at enrolling subjects and investigators; commencement and completion data; validity of final report's assessment of efficacy, safety, tolerability, and acceptability; and method of use and dissemination of findings. RESULTS: 18 studies were not approved and 45 had to be amended. Randomised controlled trials comprised 46 of the original submissions. Remuneration <b>considerations,</b> <b>inadequate</b> information or consent sheets, pregnancy safety, the need to discontinue existing therapy, and suboptimal scientific content were major reasons for rejecting studies or asking for amendments. Of the 82 approved studies 8 were not started. Shortfalls of investigators (of 39 %) and trial subjects (of 37 %) and an overall 23 % withdrawal rate were responsible for a significant incidence of inconclusive results.
