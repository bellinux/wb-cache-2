In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. If we could get into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that was good news <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time."

500|$|As {{a product}} of the Conservatory, Tchaikovsky was viewed rather negligently if not haughtily by our circle, and, owing to his being away from St. Petersburg, {{personal}} acquaintanceship was impossible.... proved to be a pleasing and sympathetic man to talk with, one who knew how to be simple of manner and always speak with evident sincerity and heartiness. The evening of our first meeting [...] played <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>at</b> Balakirev's request, the first movement of his Symphony in G minor it proved quite to our liking; and our former opinion of him changed and gave way to a more sympathetic one, although Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training still constituted a considerable barrier between him and us.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} years, Coldplay became widely {{known in the}} media for giving 10 per cent of the band's profits to charity, which they {{continue}} to do. Bassist Guy Berryman said, [...] "You can make people aware of issues. It isn't very much effort <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> all, but if it can help people, then {{we want to do}} it." [...] The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to charity, according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay's website. Martin spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US, UK and other forces during the Teenage Cancer Trust show at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003, where he encouraged the sell-out crowd to [...] "sing against war".

500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its {{first glimpse of}} the traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who does a lot of stuff <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E
500|$|Some criticised {{the visual}} allure of the character, up to {{allegations}} of sexual objectification. Mentioning [...] "the subject of unlockable gym slips for Ayane" [...] in 2002, Edge magazine stated that while it [...] "remains opposed to videogame censorship, the Dead or Alive franchise has certainly challenged the boundaries of taste in games." [...] In 2009, Joe Newman of GamesRadar ranked the series of Team Ninja's controversial Sigma 2 commercials, designed {{to draw attention to}} the fact that the [...] "notoriously big-breasted" [...] Ayane was a playable character (one of which was called by Destructoid [...] "the best and worst thing to have ever been created"), as the fourth most blatantly sexist game advertisement ever, adding: [...] "God forbid a moment goes by where any part of her body might be covered up." [...] Team Ninja's post-Itagaki head Yosuke Hayashi dismissed the criticism, stating in 2012: [...] "With the representation of female characters in the Dead or Alive franchise, we've always wanted to make the girls look as attractive as possible, and that's something that's not going to change <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] Hayashi explained: [...] "We are a Japanese developer, and we're making the female characters with our common sense and our creative sense. When you take that to countries outside of Japan, it tends to be very misinterpreted in some cases, people considering it sexist or derogatory, etc." [...] The issue was also dismissed in 2015 by Team Ninja creative director Tom Lee, who said they as well as most of their [...] "fans around the world don’t share the same sentiments" [...] as their critics.|$|E

Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: [...] "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...] There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his Fort! and in his Da!." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{selection}} of Greg Inglis by Queensland was disputed.

However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High School in Newcastle, New South Wales, in the Arrive Alive Cup; considered to be a senior competition. Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said [...] "there was some talk the other day that he was actually brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday but I was coach of the team.

We've become really good friends. We've been in the business about {{the same amount of time}} and both signed to Columbia Records together when we were 14. It was like a party in the studio, the energy was so high and chemistry was genuine". The song was included on the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera Ti Ti Ti (2010). The song officially impacted the radios on January 19, 2010. However, the full single release was postponed, so that [...] "Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)" [...] could be pushed forward as the fourth single. Keys and Knowles recorded their respective parts in same studios with engineer Ann Mincieli.

Near {{the end of the}} game, Perry then assisted on Bobby Ryan's empty-netter as the Ducks won 5–3. In Game 3, Perry recorded another two assists, but the Ducks fell 4–3. In Game 4, he set up Cam Fowler's power play goal early in the first period, and early in the third, Perry scored a short-handed goal to give Anaheim the lead in an eventual 6–3 victory. [...] "He's always scored big goals <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> big times, and your big guys got to be your big guys in big games," [...] Ryan Getzlaf said. [...] "There’s no doubt about it.
