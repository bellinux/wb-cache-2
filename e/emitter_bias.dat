50|$|A common {{example is}} {{connecting}} localized decoupling capacitors {{close to the}} power leads of integrated circuits to suppress coupling via the power supply connections. These act as a small localized energy reservoir that supply the circuit with current during transient, high current demand periods, preventing the voltage on the power supply rail from being pulled down by the momentary current load. Another common example {{of the use of}} decoupling capacitors is across the <b>emitter</b> <b>bias</b> resistor of transistor common emitter amplifiers to prevent the resistor absorbing a portion of the AC output power of the amplifier.|$|E

The device {{can be used for}} direct hole injection and collection, or in reverse mode in which holes are created by inelastic decay of injected hot electrons via electron-hole pair generation. In the latter case, the collected hole current is larger, and a magnetocurrent (MC) of 90 % is observed at an <b>emitter</b> <b>bias</b> of − 0. 8 V. This positive and large MC indicates that hot holes generated by hot electrons of majority spin contribute mostly to the collector current. ...|$|E

The device has the structure Si/Al 2 O 3 /base/Si with a spin-valve metal base, a Schottky barrier collector, but a silicon emitter separated from the base by a thin tunnel oxide. The energy of the hot electrons injected from the Si emitter into the base can be tuned by the <b>emitter</b> <b>bias,</b> which drops partly over the Si depletion region. Compared to a magnetic tunnel transistor with a metal emitter, the voltage drop over the thin tunnel oxide is reduced, enabling stable device operation at higher biasing conditions.

40|$|High power bipolar {{transistors}} often have multiple emitters, to achieve high currents, and {{efficient use of}} the whole emitter area. The emitters experience high current densities and are self-heated above the ambient temperature, leading to concerns about thermal run-away and damage to the device. Here we use a multi-emitter SiGe HBT, with multiple emitter contacts, to examine the temperature distribution in the emitters in such devices. We have measured the temperature increase in different <b>emitters</b> by <b>biasing</b> one <b>emitter</b> {{at a time and}} using the other base 2 ̆ 013 emitter junctions as thermometers.

50|$|The circuit shown {{consists}} of two stages of amplifier in common <b>emitter</b> topology. The <b>bias</b> resistors all serve their usual functions. The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting the bias. However, the collector load {{consists of}} a transformer which serves as the inter-stage coupling instead of capacitors. The windings of the transformer have inductance. Capacitors placed across the transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide the tuning of the amplifier.|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} net {{positive}} {{oxide trapped charge}} and surface recombination velocity in producing excess base current in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are identified. Although the interaction of these two quantities is physically complex, simple approaches for estimating their magnitude from measured BJT characteristics are presented. The oxide charge is estimated using a transition voltage in the plot of excess base current versus <b>emitter</b> <b>bias.</b> Two approaches for quantifying the effects of surface recombination velocity are described. The first measures surface recombination directly using a gated diode, while the second estimates its effects using an intercept current that is easily obtained from the BJT itself. The results are compared to two-dimensional simulations and measurements made on test structures. The techniques are simple to implement and {{provide insight into the}} mechanisms and magnitudes of the radiation-induced damage in BJTs. A physically-based comparison between hot-carrier and ionizing radiation stress in BJTs is presented as well. Although both types of stress lead to qualitatively similar changes in the current gain of the device, the physical mechanisms responsible for the degradation are quite different. Implications for correlating and comparing hot-carrier-induced and ionizing-radiation-induced damage are discussed. Finally, the worst-case increase in base current is shown to be dose-rate independent. This fact allows the worst-case response of bipolar devices to be determined using convenient laboratory dose rates...|$|E
40|$|GaN-based {{semiconductors}} show {{promise for}} the fabrication of electronic components capable of high power, high frequency operation. This has {{lead to the}} development of both AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field effect and bipolar junction transistors. In order to increase the efficiency of these devices novel fabrication technologies are examined. Contact resistances to buried p-type layers, exposed using a novel wet etch, were found to be superior when compared to those formed on dry etched structures. Utilising this technology in conjunction with a novel inverted n-p-n AlGaN/GaN HBT is found to increase the emitter-base heterojunction quality and also reduces growth complexity. Replacing the n-type collector with a Schottky diode was found to significantly reduce leakage in the component and enable normal operation under common <b>emitter</b> <b>bias</b> conditions. Bulk and surface trapping effects in AIGaN/GaN heterostructures are independently identified. Bulk traps are found to be located close to or at the me -semiconductor interface which results in a modification to the HFET band structure. Gate leakage current along the AIGaN surface is found to be controlled by injection from the gate and a surface hopping conduction mechanism which dominates at high and low temperature respectively. Passivation of the structure using SiN reduces current flow at the AIGaN surface. Employing a plasma pre-treatment, contamination at the surface of the device can be removed allowing intimate contact between the passivation and AlGaN films. Using a CF 4 plasma treatment is found to remove these contaminants and deposits a thin film of AlF 3 on the AlGaN surface which reduces current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HFETs to negligible levels. GaN capping layers on HFETs can reduce both parasitic contact resistances and also reduce current collapse. Methods of selectively etching through the GaN capping layer are presented in order to develop a suitable self-aligned gate recess process...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study was field {{influence}} on electron emission into vacuum from ITO films deposited on glass surface. The films were deposited onto both surfaces of the glass and examined using the Malter effect controlled by electric field. One of the layers was the field electrode and the other was treated as the electron <b>emitter.</b> The <b>bias</b> voltage was applied to the field electrode. The analysis was carried out at a pressure of 10 – 5 Pa. Dependences of the secondary emission coefficient on the bias voltage and energy distributions of secondary electrons were determined. The diagrams obtained are characterized by high non-monotonic behaviour. The voltage pulse amplitude spectra were recorded in the multichannel amplitude analyzer. It has been found that pulses count depends exponentially on the bias voltage. The emission efficiency at the same inducing field is affected by the state in which the sample was before the measurement. This means that the field induced electron emission shows hysteresis-like behaviour. The existence of this effect proves that the electric field causes some irreversible changes in the electron emitting ITO layer...|$|R

Without the scattering layer, the EQE enhancement was half this value, indicating that the effect of the back-scatterer is to double the efficacy of the upconverting device.

Here we report the design, epitaxial growth, fabrication, and characterization of such QODs that incorporate ∼ 2 - 3 nm thick InGaN/GaN quantum structures for operation between 380 nm and 400 nm. In reverse bias, our QODs show an optical absorption coefficient change of ∼ 14000 cm - 1 with a reverse bias of 9 V (corresponding to ∼ 40 cm - 1 absorption coefficient change for 1 V/μm field swing) at 385 nm, reported {{for the first time}} for InGaN/GaN quantum structures in the near-UV range. In forward bias, though, our QODs exhibit optical electroluminescence spectrum centered around 383 nm with a full width at half maximum of 20 nm and photoluminescence spectrum centered around 370 nm with a full width at half maximum of 12 nm.

30|$|Electrophoresis is a {{derivative}} of inking deposition. Electrophoresis involves the motion, placement, and potentially modest alignment of drop or spray deposited CNTs. Electrophoresis exploits the CNTs native anisotropic charge distribution and its interaction with an applied electric field [160, 167, 168]. Elsewhere {{it has been}} widely used {{as a means of}} depositing phosphor materials. It has also been applied to the deposition of bundles of SWCNTs on various substrates, such as stainless steel or doped Si [167 – 179]. Composite CNT films deposited by electrophoresis have been fabricated with controlled surface density with good field emission performance, current density and long-term stability under high operating voltages, which has been applied to an electron source for high-resolution X-ray imaging [160]. Wang et al. [169] deposited MWCNTs on Cr/Cu electrodes supported on an oxidised Si support with a glass interlayer adhesion promoter. The emitters were annealed at 480 °C for 30  min following deposition to mobilise the glass interlayer and reduce the effective interfacial resistance. As with other solution-based fabrication techniques, {{in order to reduce the}} <b>emitters</b> turn-on <b>bias</b> they were taped to activate them; a threshold field of 3.5  V/μm was measured (for an emission current density of 10  μA/cm 2). Though a simple and low-cost means of defining the pixel size, electrophorectially defined emission zones only allow for relatively large cathode diameters, of the order of 2  mm, which reduces the systems functionality. Calderón-Colón et al. [160] employed photolithography and liquid phase electrophoretic deposition to pattern disordered and unaligned MWCNTs in a homogenous solution with MgCl 2 and glass frits. Here the film thickness was broadly controlled by the deposition time and the magnitude of the applied voltage, though accurate sample-to-sample reproducibility and control over the thickness, to < 10  nm surface roughness, is challenging. Such techniques are comparatively low in uniformity and reproducibility, a direct consequence of the simple macro scale processing. Moreover, the common binder matrices are far from pure, making elucidation of the underlying emission mechanisms somewhat challenging, though nonetheless functional. Indeed, as with all other inking deposition techniques, the emitters do require mechanical activation for the cathodes to be of any practical use, though electrophoretic patterning is indeed rapid and simple to implement.|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} {{partially}} neutralized plasmas is largely unexplored, {{partly because of}} the difficulty of confining such plasmas. Plasmas are confined in a stellarator without the need for a plasma current, and regardless of the degree of neutralization. The Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) is a stellarator dedicated to the study of non-neutral, and partially neutralized plasmas. This thesis describes the first systematic studies of plasmas of arbitrary neutrality. The degree of neutralization of the plasma can be parameterized through the quantity η ≡ |n_e - Z n_i|/|n_e + Z n_i|. In CNT, η can be varied continuously from pure electron (η = 1) to quasi-neutral (η ≈ 0) by adjusting the neutral pressure in the chamber, which controls the volumetric ionization rate. Pure electron plasmas are in macroscopically stable equilibria, and have strong self electric potentials dictated by the <b>emitter</b> filament <b>bias</b> voltage on the magnetic axis. As η decreases, the plasma potential decouples from the emitter, and spontaneous fluctuations begin to appear. Partially neutralized plasmas (10 ^- 3 < η < 10 ^- 1) generally exhibit multi-mode oscillations in CNT. However, when magnetized ions are present, the electron-rich plasma oscillates at a single dominant mode (20 - 100 kHz). As the plasma approaches quasi-neutrality (η < 10 ^- 5), it also reverts to single mode behavior (1 - 20 kHz). A parametric characterization of the single mode fluctuations detected in plasmas of arbitrary neutrality is presented in this thesis along with measurements of the spatial structure of the oscillations. The single mode fluctuations observed for η ≈ 0. 01 to 0. 8 are identified as an ion resonant instability propagating close to the E × B velocity of the plasma. The experiments also show that these oscillations present a poloidal mode number m = 1, and a toroidal number n = 0, which is identical to the spatial structure of the diocotron instability in pure-toroidal traps, and implies that the ion-driven instability breaks parallel force balance and the conservation of poloidal flux in CNT. The low frequency oscillations detected in the quasi-neutral regime are a global instability convected by the E × B flow of the plasma. In this case, the mode aligns almost perfectly with the field lines, and presents a resonant m = 3 poloidal structure...|$|R
40|$|Spin {{electronics}} is a {{new research}} area, which not only uses the electron’s charge but also its spin. By using the electron spin dependent properties of magnetic materials one can make devices with a new functionality. This has lead to magnetoresistive devices that can change their resistance by 10 to 50 % in small magnetic fields, such as giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices and the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This large resistance change {{can be used in}} applications such as read heads or serve as memory elements in a magnetic random access memory (MRAM). This thesis describes two devices: the spin-valve transistor (SVT) and the magnetic tunnel transistor (MTT). The SVT has an unique property, namely its huge relative collector current change of more than 300 % in small magnetic fields at room temperature. This unique property by itself is not enough to warrant the applicability of the SVT. The other properties that are important for the applicability of the SVT are described in this thesis. An alternative to the SVT, the MTT, will also be discussed. The SVT is a hybrid device that generally has an n-Si/ Pt / Ni 82 Fe 18 / Au/ Co/ Au/ n-Si structure. The Pt / Ni 82 Fe 18 / Au/ Co/ Au multi layer is the base and the two semiconductors on each side are the emitter and the collector respectively. The SVT is used in the common base configuration, where the emitter barrier (Si/Pt) is forward biased and the collector diode is zero or reversed biased. A flow of electrons from the silicon over the Schottky barrier into the metal base starts when the <b>emitter</b> is forward <b>biased.</b> These electrons have an excess energy compared to the Fermi level of the base and move {{in the direction of the}} collector. The electrons that are scattered in the base will lose their energy or momentum and make up the base current. Only those electrons that reach the collector with the right momentum and a high enough energy can enter the collector. The collector current is thus extremely sensitive to the scattering conditions in the base. The scattering conditions in the Ni 82 Fe 18 and the Co layer are different for the spin-up and spin-down electrons. This makes the total scattering dependent on the relative magnetizations of the Ni 82 Fe 18 and the Co layer. The collector current is largest when the magnetizations are parallel (I P C) and smallest when the magnetizations are anti-parallel aligned (I AP C). The relative change in collector current is called the magnetocurrent (MC = (I P C - I AP C) /I AP C). This PhD research started with the development of a reliable process for fabricating spin-valve transistors. The introduction of this process together with the introduction of an ultra-high vacuum metal-evaporation system and the right choice of materials resulted in the SVT’s that exhibit an MC of more than 300 % at room temperature. This thesis starts with a study on the size dependence of the magnetic and electrical properties of the SVT. We extended the previously mentioned process by using silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers, a combination of dry and wet etching techniques and SU 8 (a negative tone photoresist) as an insulator layer. We were successful in producing SVTs with lateral dimensions that ranged from 300 µm by 300 µm to 10 µm by 10 µm. As expected, we saw no influence of the dimensions on the Schottky barrier height. Moreover the reverse current scaled down linearly with area. Both observations show that we have high-quality Schottky diodes. The key property of the SVT, its MC, showed no size dependence and remained constant around 240 % for all dimensions. The transfer ratio is the ratio between the applied emitter current and the measured collector current. This ratio showed a slight decrease for transistors with dimensions below 25 µm by 25 µm. This is attributed to a deterioration of the emitter efficiency. The maximum possible emitter current decreases with transistor dimensions. The limiting factor is the maximum possible current density in the spin-valve base, which is 1. 7 × 10 7 A/cm 2. This value agrees with electromigration failure of spin valves. We have shown that it is possible to scale the lateral dimensions of the SVT down to 10 µm by 10 µm. In my view further scaling down is limited to the physical height needed for the emitter, which includes the depletion width for the Schottky barrier and the doping profile needed for the Ohmic contact. To characterize the noise sources of the SVT we studied the frequency spectrum of three types of transistors that differed only in the type of metal base. The measurement showed that the frequency spectrum of the transistor with only non-magnetic layers in the base was completely dominated by shot noise in the frequency range of the measurement (10 Hz to 100 kHz). The inclusion of one or more magnetic layers lowered the collector current and thus the level of the shot noise. It did not however change the nature of the noise or add noise (of magnetic origin) to the collector current. The collector current spectral density (SI) changes linearly with IC in a quasi-static magnetic field as expected for shot noise. We have however not observed 1 /f noise in our measurements, not even at the switching fields of the spin valve. With this knowledge we can calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the SVT. The SNR increases with increasing MC and also with the absolute value collector current. From the basic relation IC = α IE we see that we can increase the collector current by either increasing the emitter current (IE) or the transfer ratio (alpha). We saw before that the emitter current has an upper limit imposed by device breakdown, therefore the way to enlarge IC is to improve the transfer ratio. We started to improve α by enlarging the energy difference between the emitter and collector barrier. The transfer ratio increased with increasing energy difference due to the larger number of states available at the collector semiconductor when electrons arrive with a higher energy. The transfer ratio also improves when materials with longer attenuation lengths are used in the base, i. e. Au instead of Pt. The influence of the SVT’s structural quality on the transfer ratio is demonstrated by the optimum in collector current versus Pt layer thickness. Furthermore, by varying the thickness of the NiFe layer we were able to prove that there is a maximum in the absolute current change for a certain thickness, due to the trade-off between transfer ratio and MC. The same study yielded a value for the attenuation of an interface, which is a factor of 0. 55. The influence of crystal orientation on the transfer ratio was found to be negligible. Temperature effects on the transfer ratio are weak and are due to the spatial distribution of Schottky barrier heights and thermal spin wave scattering. Summarizing, we improved the transfer ratio by a factor of 118 from a Si/Pt/NiFe/Au/Co/Pt/Si SVT compared with a Si/Au/NiFe/Au/Co/Cu/Si transistor, while the MC remained constant above 200 % and showed only small and non-systematic changes. The latter implies that the collection of both the spin-up and spin-down electrons can be improved, resulting in an increase in collector current without affecting the MC. The best results so far for SVTs are with a Si/ Au (20 Å) / Ni 82 Fe 18 (30 Å) / Au (70 Å) / Co (30 Å) / Au (40 Å) / Si SVT, it has a transfer ratio of 1. 2 × 10 4 and an MC of 230 %. Further improvement of the transfer ratio might result from better control over the quality of the complete SVT structure. Another option is to use a tunnel barrier on the emitter side. This not only allows one to further enlarge the energy difference between the injected electrons and the collector Schottky barrier, but also opens up the possibility to remove layers from the base if a ferromagnetic emitter electrode is used, as in an MTT. Magnetic tunnel transistors have been successfully realized with the use of in situ shadow mask technology. Already we achieved a transfer ratio equal to that of SVTs, while the MCof the MTT is above 100 %. The MTT has a Si/ Co/ Al 2 O 3 / CoFe/ IrMn/ Ta structure. We have shown that the MTT can be used to determine a lower limit for the tunnel spin polarization of a ferromagnet/insulator interface. With a MTT this lower limit can be determined in a large temperature and tunnel-barrier bias range. The transfer ratio measured versus tunnel-barrier bias continues to increase, due to the larger number of available states at the collector at higher energies. More research is needed to explain the tunnelbarrier bias dependence of the MC. We expect that MTTs can be improved by using evaporation techniques rather than sputter techniques. Furthermore the quality of the collector diode can be improved with a corresponding increase in transfer ratio by choosing the right materials. The comparison of the SVT and MTT with tunnel junctions in terms of signal, noise, scalability, frequency response, robustness and of course the ability to study the properties of spin-polarized hot-electrons in magnetic materials justifies the further research of SVTs and MTTs.
