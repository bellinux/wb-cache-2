Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare),</b> olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
25|$|Fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare)</b> is a {{flowering}} plant {{species in the}} carrot family. It is a hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves.

25|$|Fennel, <b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare,</b> is a {{perennial}} herb. It is erect, glaucous green, and grows to heights {{of up to}} 2.5m, with hollow stems. The leaves grow up to 40cm long; they are finely dissected, with the ultimate segments filiform (threadlike), about 0.5mm wide. (Its leaves {{are similar to those}} of dill, but thinner.) The flowers are produced in terminal compound umbels 5–15cm wide, each umbel section having 20–50 tiny yellow flowers on short pedicels. The fruit is a dry seed from 4–10mm long, half as wide or less, and grooved.|$|E

The inflated leaf bases are eaten as a vegetable, both raw and cooked. Several cultivars of Florence fennel are also known by several other names, notably the Italian name finocchio.

50|$|The Corsican {{swallowtail}} inhabits mountainous regions at 400 - 1500 m {{above sea}} level on the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. The food plants are from the family Umbelliferae, and include fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare),</b> giant fennel (Ferula communis), Corsican rue (Ruta corsica) and Peucedanum paniculatum though some of these records are disputed. Papilio hospiton is bivoltine with broods in May and August. Habitat destruction and disappearance of food plants as well as excessive collecting are the principal threats to the Corsican swallowtail.|$|E
50|$|Many {{members of}} this family are {{cultivated}} for various purposes. Parsnips (Pastinaca sativa), carrots (Daucus carota) and Hamburg parsley (Petroselinum crispum), produce tap roots that are {{large enough to be}} useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley (Petroselinum crispum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), culantro, and dill (Anethum graveolens). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (Coriandrum sativum), fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare),</b> cumin (Cuminum cyminum), and caraway (Carum carvi).|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "stinking chamomile" [...] Anthemis cotula is so-named for its {{resemblance}} to the true chamomile plant, Anthemis nobilis; both have branching upright stems each topped by a single large flower head, although the [...] "stinking chamomile" [...] is distinguished by lacking the membraneous scales underneath the flowers of the true chamomile, {{as well as by}} its characteristic strong odor. The leaves of Anthemis cotula have a similar appearance to those of the fennel plant (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare),</b> from which the name [...] "Dog's Fennel" [...] is derived.|$|E

50|$|Adults of T. unicolor feed at {{honeydew}} secretions and flowers. Females {{have been}} captured at honeydew from galls of Disholcapsis eldoradensis on Quercus lobata and at flowers of Asclepias erosa, Baccharis sarothroides, Chrysothamnus sp., Lepidospartum squamatum, and Wislizenia refracta. Males {{have been taken}} on the flowers of Calochortus catalinae, Hemizonia fasciculata, Rhamnus californica, and Xanthium spinosum. Both males and females visit the extrafloral nectaries of Helianthus and have been collected at flowers of Atriplex semibaccata, Cicuta sp., Eriogonum fasciculatum, Eriogonum gracile, and <b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare.</b> The flight period in California is from May to October, with a peak in July and August.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, {{this species}} mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as marsh hog's fennel) is {{normally}} the only food plant {{used by the}} caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses {{a wide variety of}} umbellifers including wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare),</b> and hogweeds (Heracleum). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (Ruta chalepensis) in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel.|$|E
5000|$|Alongside {{lemongrass}} and mate, infusions {{from plants}} cultivated domestically or in local little properties usually served as everyday drinks are Melissa officinalis, the lemon balm, there known as erva-cidreira or citronela, Mentha, the mint, there known as hortelã (...)

50|$|The second monthly {{event is}} 3rd Saturday Restoration, held from 8:00 - 11:00 am. For this event, Board members work with volunteers {{of all ages}} on {{removing}} invasive non-native species and tending newly planted natives. The Board has had great success at monoculture management. For example, a team of students from nearby California State University, Dominguez Hills has been trained to manage fennel (<b>Foeniculum</b> <b>vulgare)</b> and castor bean (Ricinus communis), two formerly very invasive plants at the preserve. Monoculture management was begun in 2009. Within two years, all old stands of both fennel and castor bean had been cut to the ground. Since then, on Restoration days, the university students roam the preserve looking for new shoots of fennel and castor bean to cut to the ground.|$|E
