In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher <b>import</b> <b>bill.</b> Brazil opted to continue a high-growth policy. Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of import substitution industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self-sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages. Its main components were to promote import substitution of basic industrial inputs (steel, aluminium, fertilizers, petrochemicals), to make large investments in the expansion of the economic infrastructure, and to promote exports.|$|E
25|$|Since independence, India's {{balance of}} {{payments}} on its current account has been negative. Since economic liberalisation in the 1990s, precipitated by a balance-of-payment crisis, India's exports rose consistently, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91. However, the global economic slump followed by a general deceleration in world trade saw the exports {{as a percentage of}} imports drop to 61.4% in 2008–09. India's growing oil <b>import</b> <b>bill</b> is seen as the main driver behind the large current account deficit, which rose to $118.7billion, or 11.11% of GDP, in 2008–09. Between January and October 2010, India imported $82.1billion worth of crude oil. The Indian economy has run a trade deficit every year from 2002 to 2012, with a merchandise trade deficit of US$189 billion in 2011–12.

This is the main conclusion of a study undertaken by FAO to analyse the drivers of demand for irrigated production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Steeply rising commercial food <b>import</b> <b>bills</b> for staple crops across SSA are indicative of the level demand that is not being met from domestic production. The increase of area under equipped/spate irrigation for the whole of Africa over the last ten years amounts to 1. 27 million ha, which is equal to about 127 000 ha a year. This rate of growth has proved too low to have an impact on food <b>import</b> <b>bills</b> and buffer regional food security. However, within subregional trading groups there is scope for consolidation of market supply. Irrigated production opportunities in SSA could be realised where natural resources and markets coincide, but only through a great deal more attention to costs of production, price formation, effective water allocation mechanisms, economically efficient water use and strong, responsive institutions.

30|$|In this paper, we {{take part}} in this stream of {{research}} by examining the explanatory role of oil price in food price development from Malaysia’s experience and perspectives. Malaysia is a fast-growing Asian economy underpinned by its structural transformation from a commodity-based economy to an industrial-based economy. The transformation has seen Malaysia to be increasingly reliant on food imports for its consumption. Being heavily dependent on food imports, Malaysia is arguably more exposed to oil and global food crises. In the year of escalating food and commodity prices in 2008, Malaysia’s food <b>import</b> <b>bills</b> went up by more than 19 %, far exceeding the annual average increase in the <b>import</b> <b>bills</b> of 8.5 % from 2001 to 2010 c. Accordingly, as regards to food security, Malaysia {{is likely to be}} at stake in the face of rising oil price. Further, in Malaysia, Yeong-Sheng (2008) computes the food budget across income quartiles using the Household Expenditure Survey 2004 / 2005 to be 33.03 %, 25.92 %, 21.2 % and 14.63 % for respectively Quartile 1, Quartile 2, Quartile 3, and Quartile 4. This means that the rising food prices will affect households at lower income quartiles more than those at the upper income levels. In light of recent energy market developments, proper assessment of the food price dynamics and its relations to oil price is urgently needed and hence the present analysis.|$|R

30|$|The {{episodes of}} rising food prices {{witnessed}} in recent years, especially during 2007 – 2008 and 2010 – 2011, have stimulated extensive popular and academic discussions and placed governments on alert {{as to their}} socio-economic implicationsa. With the need to carve or suggest policy prescriptions to contain food price escalation, numerous studies have been undertaken to identify determinants of food price variations. It is not surprising that, with concurrent upswings of crude oil price during the same years, the oil price has been examined as a potential explanation. A conventional wisdom tells us that, by affecting energy-intensive inputs such as fertilizers and fuel and influencing transportation costs, the oil price changes directly affect food production costs and subsequently food prices. In addition, given the increasing costs of global food production, food <b>import</b> <b>bills</b> would surge during times of rising oil price for food-importing countries and accordingly further exert an upward pressure on domestic prices of food items.
