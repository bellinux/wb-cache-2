5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
500|$|The Cincinnati CityBeat {{reported}} that the album had been titled Life Giver, but Heppner coined the album's current name while at a hotel on tour. Flipping through the channels on the hotel television in search of shows like CSI, he was {{just in time to}} see a segment on A where a detective commented on a woman's death in a house fire. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to the effect of, [...] "The amount of carbon monoxide in the victim's lungs proves that she had died prior to the fire," [...] and Heppner liked the way the last words sounded.|$|E

2500|$|Keith Hoerig: We got {{the name}} Five Iron Frenzy from a roommate {{of most of}} ours. He was kind of paranoid, and afraid that if he went outside on this {{particular}} night {{he was going to}} get jumped by some people. He had a golf club to defend himself and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to the effect of it being like [...] "putter mayhem". Scott looked at the golf club he was holding, and noting that it was a five iron said, [...] "No, more like a Five Iron Frenzy." [...] The name stuck.|$|E

She often accompanied him to speaking engagements where {{they made an}} odd couple: Heffer was both tall and heavily built, while his wife was only 4'6" [...] tall. Heffer made a good-humoured complaint when political journalist Andrew Roth described Doris as [...] "tiny", insisting that she was actually [...] "petite". According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer {{would sit in the}} front row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying, [...] "Nonsense, Eric" [...] if <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> with which she disagreed. The Heffers had no children.|$|E
2500|$|A {{concern with}} {{language}} {{was central to}} Kraus's outlook, and he viewed his contemporaries' careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world. Viennese composer Ernst Krenek described meeting the writer in 1932: [...] "At {{a time when people}} were generally decrying the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But I have to do this, {{as long as it is}} at all possible; for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 1778, Lee was court-martialled at Brunswick, New Jersey {{by a jury}} presided by Lord Stirling {{on three}} charges: 1. disobedience of orders in not attacking the enemy; 2. misbehavior before the enemy in making an unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat; 3. disrespect to the commander-in-chief. Lee was found guilty, and he was {{relieved}} of command {{for a period of}} one year. (In his Narrative, Joseph Plumb Martin recounted that Washington rode up during the retreat and asked Martin's officers [...] "by whose order the troops [...] retreating". [...] He was told that it was [...] "by Gen. Lee's", and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that Martin wasn't close enough to hear. Martin was told later by those who had been close enough that Washington had said [...] "damn him!" [...] as he rode off, which Martin found unusual but plausible since Washington had been [...] "in a great passion" [...] because of the retreat.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Executives from Universal, {{including}} Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg, {{were not}} very enthusiastic. [...] "I think they were shocked," [...] recalled Spikings. [...] "What really upset them was 'God Bless America'. Sheinberg thought it was anti-American. He was vehement. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> like 'You're poking a stick {{in the eye of}} America.' They really didn't like the movie. And they certainly didn't like it at three hours and two minutes." [...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. [...] "A picture under {{two and a half hours}} can scrape three shows a day," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but at three hours you've lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E
