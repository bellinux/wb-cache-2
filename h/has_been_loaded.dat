25|$|During the G1 {{stage of}} the cell cycle, the {{replication}} initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G1 stage to the S phase of the cell cycle, S phase–specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork. During this transformation, the pre-RC is disassembled {{with the loss of}} Cdc6, creating the initiation complex. In addition to the binding of the Mcm proteins, cell division cycle 45 (Cdc45) protein is also essential for initiating DNA replication. Studies have shown that Mcm is critical for the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and this complex containing both Mcm and Cdc45 is formed {{at the onset of the}} S phase of the cell cycle. Cdc45 targets the Mcm protein complex, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>loaded</b> onto the chromatin, as a component of the pre-RC at the origin of replication during the G1 {{stage of the}} cell cycle.|$|E

25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>loaded.</b> The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E
2500|$|As is usual with U.S. {{military}} ammunition, the [...]45-70 was {{an immediate}} hit among American sportsmen, and the [...]45-70 has survived to the present day. Today, the traditional 405-grain (26.2 g) load is considered adequate for any North American big game within its range limitations, including the great bears, {{and it does not}} destroy edible meat on smaller animals such as deer due to the bullet's low velocity. It is very good for big-game hunting in brush or heavy timber where the range is usually short. The [...]45-70, when loaded with the proper bullets at appropriate velocities, has been used to hunt the African [...] "Big Five". The [...]45-70 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>loaded</b> and used to harvest everything from birds to elephant and the cartridge is still undergoing new development work well over a century after its introduction.|$|E
