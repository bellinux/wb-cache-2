25|$|The final {{ministry}} in Jerusalem is traditionally called the Passion and begins with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> {{that includes the}} Last Supper, and liturgically marked by Holy Week. The gospels {{pay special attention to}} the account of the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, and the narrative amounts to about one third of the text of the four gospels, showing its theological significance in Christian thought in the Early Church.|$|E
25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E

A concentrated effort to plow (and tow as necessary) – called the “Snow Blitz” by the press – managed to make significant progress on Tuesday, January 25, and Wednesday, January 26, {{with the help of}} 960 tickets and 140 tows.

2500|$|Freak winter rains across Mexico {{collapsed}} hillsides, sent rivers {{over their}} banks and left at least 15 people dead, officials said on Friday, February 5. The rain, which began <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> and peaked on Thursday, February 4, had relented by Friday morning, providing officials {{with their first}} {{good look at the}} damage. More than half of the country was affected. The hardest area hit by the storm was the western state of Michoacán, a famous reserve for monarch butterflies, where at least 13 people were killed by landslides and flooding. An unknown number of people were missing Friday. Other areas that were hard hit by flooding was the eastern Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa and municipalities in eastern State of Mexico such as Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl and Ecatepec de Morelos. The rain broke records for February in Michoacán, the State of Mexico and Mexico City, with twice the normal amount for the entire month falling in 24 hours. There was a silver lining: Officials said the copious rain had filled reservoirs outside Mexico City that are a key source of water for the metropolis. Water shortages had forced on-and-off rationing since last summer. Water authorities state that most of the country now has a [...] "positive balance" [...] in reservoirs with [...] of water added to reservoirs.|$|E
2500|$|A trench was dug in {{the sand}} {{alongside}} the ship, which had been made watertight. Four 20-tonne containers {{were placed on the}} port side, and water was to be pumped from the starboard to port tanks in an effort to right the ship. No date was set for the operation, due to the strong winds at the time. Once the ship was righted, it was expected to take several weeks to refloat her. Attempts to right her were abandoned on 12 March after storms battered her with [...] winds, causing her to sink further into the sand and the list to increase to 100 degrees. The salvage plan was re-evaluated <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> commencing 17 March. Meanwhile, work continued to reduce the threat of pollution from the vessel and clearing up any wreckage that was deposited from the vessel. A meeting between the salvors, insurers and owners of the ship took place on 20 March to discuss options for salvage. One option considered was to scrap her on site. On 21 March 2008, it was revealed that she had been declared a [...] "constructive total loss" [...] due to further damage inflicted by the storms earlier in the month. The preferred option was to refloat her and remove her by sea, but she would be cut up on site if the refloating operation failed. The plan was to use mechanical winches to haul her upright, rather than relying upon flotation devices.|$|E
