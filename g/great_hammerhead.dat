5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads, but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had the opposite effect.|$|E
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> shark. A <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{and other}} large fishes, in {{particular}} the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna mokarran), prey upon the roughtail stingray. The live sharksucker (Echeneis naucrates) is sometimes found attached to its body. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium woodsholei, Anthocephalum centrurum, Lecanicephalum sp., Oncomegas wageneri, Polypocephalus sp., Pterobothrium senegalense, and Rhinebothrium maccallumi, the monogenean Dendromonocotyle centrourae, and the leech Branchellion torpedinis.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} has few natural predators; attacks on this species have been {{reported}} from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related nurse shark {{has been known to}} fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine.|$|R
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} <b>hammerhead</b> sharks, <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> are viviparous: once the {{developing}} young use up their supply of yolk, the yolk sac {{is transformed into}} a structure analogous to a mammalian placenta. Unlike most other sharks, which mate on or near the sea bottom, <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> have been observed mating near the surface. In one account from the Bahamas, a mating pair ascended while swimming around each other, mating when they reached the surface. Females breed once every two years, giving birth from late spring to summer in the Northern Hemisphere and from December to January in Australian waters. The gestation period is 11 months. The litter size ranges from 6 - 55 pups, with 20 - 40 being typical. The young measure 50 - 70 cm at birth; males reach maturity at 2.3 - 2.8 m long and 51 kg and the females at 2.5 - 3.0 m and 41 kg. The young differ from the adults in having a rounded frontal margin on the head. The typical lifespan of this species is 20 - 30 years; the record Boca Grande female was estimated to be 40 - 50 years old.|$|R
5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead.</b> Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
25|$|Potential predators of spiny {{butterfly}} rays include larger fish {{such as the}} <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna mokarran), and marine mammals. In the northwest Atlantic, the depletion of seven large shark species by commercial fisheries {{has led to an}} increase in the population of the spiny butterfly ray and other mid-level predators. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Anthobothrium altavelae and Pterobothrioides petterae, and the gill parasite Heteronchocotyle gymnurae.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the largest}} extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), {{and the great}} white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Some other species such as megamouth sharks (Megachasma pelagios), Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus), Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are {{comparatively}} poorly studied, {{it is unclear whether}} their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark. The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna mokarran), a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark, has a similar or even greater average body length, but is lighter and less bulky, with a maximum known weight of [...]|$|E

50|$|Compared to the {{scalloped}} and <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> {{the smooth}} hammerhead stays {{closer to the}} surface, in water less than 20 m deep. However, it has been recorded diving {{to a depth of}} 200 m. It prefers inshore waters such as bays and estuaries, but is sometimes found in the open ocean over the continental shelf, and around oceanic islands. This shark has also been reported entering freshwater habitats, such as the Indian River in Florida. In the summer, smooth hammerheads migrate poleward to stay in cooler water, heading back towards the equator in winter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> {{have been}} kept in captivity at several facilities, {{including}} Atlantis Paradise Island Resort (Bahamas), Adventure Aquarium (New Jersey), Georgia Aquarium (Atlanta), Mote Marine Laboratory (Florida), and the shark reef exhibit at Mandalay Bay (Las Vegas). Aquarist Dean Trinh has successfully raised scalloped hammerhead pups, which he has claimed were collected by hand from {{an environment in which}} they might otherwise face the prospect of starvation. Other aquarists have noted the importance of providing adequate room for hammerheads to swim constantly and for the provision of mechanical filtration systems to maintain suitable water quality for shark survival. In 2015, the proprietors of the nightclub Atlantis in Adelaide, South Australia, announced plans to keep two hammerhead sharks in a 3 m diameter cylindrical tank on their premises. The proposal prompted animal-rights activists to start a petition calling for the abandonment of the idea. The petition attracted 35,000 signatures in two weeks.|$|R
500|$|Most {{observed}} displays by grey reef sharks {{have been}} {{in response to a}} diver (or submersible) approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above. They also perform the display towards moray eels, and in one instance towards a much larger <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (which subsequently withdrew). However, they have never been seen performing threat displays towards each other. This suggests the display is primarily a response to potential threats (i.e. predators) rather than competitors. As grey reef sharks are not territorial, they are speculated to be defending a critical volume of [...] "personal space" [...] around themselves. Compared to sharks from French Polynesia or Micronesia, grey reef sharks from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most easily {{recognizable}} sharks, the smalleye hammerhead has had a long history of taxonomic confusion that still remains to be fully resolved. Its scientific name originated in 1822, with French zoologist Achille Valenciennes' description of Zygaena tudes in the scientific journal Memoires du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle; the specific epithet tudes is Latin for [...] "hammer". Valenciennes made reference to three specimens: one from Nice in France, one from Cayenne in French Guyana, and one from the Coromandel Coast of India. However, for over two centuries, taxonomists believed Valenciennes' account matched the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> which thus became known as Zygaena (later Sphyrna) tudes. The smalleye hammerhead was known by a different name, Sphyrna bigelowi, coined by Stewart Springer in a 1944 issue of Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences.|$|E
500|$|Megalodon, like {{contemporaneous}} sharks, {{made use}} of nursery areas to house their young, with large amounts of food and protection from predators. Fossil {{evidence suggests that the}} preferred nursery sites of megalodon were warm-water coastal environments, where threats were minor and food plentiful. Nursery sites were identified in the Gatun Formation of Panama, the Calvert Formation of Maryland, Banco de Concepción in the Canary Islands, and the Bone Valley Formation of Florida. Given that all extant lamniform sharks give birth to live young, this {{is believed to have been}} true of megalodon also. Infant megalodons were around [...] at their smallest, and the pups were vulnerable to predation by other shark species, such as the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> shark (Sphyrna mokarran) and the snaggletooth shark (Hemipristis serra). Their dietary preferences display an ontogenetic shift: Young megalodon commonly preyed on fish, giant sea turtles, dugongs, and small cetaceans; mature megalodon moved to off-shore areas and consumed large cetaceans.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the nine}} known species of hammerhead, only three {{are known to}} be {{particularly}} dangerous to humans: the scalloped, <b>great,</b> and smooth <b>hammerheads.</b> As of 2013, 33 attacks have been recorded, with no fatalities.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{predominantly}} {{known for}} his career as an athlete for the NFL and his dedication to local High School Athletics, D.P. recently eliminated an interesting threat to the City of Fort Lauderdale. Since February 2011, a giant <b>Great</b> White <b>Hammerhead</b> Shark has pestered the area immediately outside of the Port Everglades inlet. Daryl Porter, being an accomplished fisherman and diver, set out to capture or contain this beast. From March 2011 to July 2011 D.P. was a regular sight hunting this <b>great</b> White Shark <b>Hammerhead</b> from Barracuda Reef south of the inlet to the Shoals North of the inlet. On July 23, 2011 8:23 PM, D.P. declared [...] "Fish On" [...] to his boatmate, Oronde Gadsden. D.P. fought the fish for 2 hours until the shark sought refuge {{in the bottom of}} Barracuda Reef. At this point, D.P. donned his diving gear and proceeded to hunt the shark underwater. After 30 minutes of downtime, D.P. pushed the dead shark to the surface where Mr. Gadsden hauled it aboard.

5000|$|The {{scalloped}} hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) is {{a species of}} hammerhead shark, {{and part of the}} family Sphyrnidae. Originally known as Zygaena lewini, its genus name was later changed to its current name. The Greek word sphyrna translates into [...] "hammer" [...] in English, referring to the shape of this shark's head. The most distinguishing characteristic of this shark, as in all hammerheads, is the 'hammer' on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are at the tips of the extensions. This is a fairly large hammerhead, though is smaller than both the <b>great</b> and smooth <b>hammerheads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is {{extremely}} vulnerable to overfishing {{due to its}} low overall abundance and long generation time. Assessment of its conservation status is difficult as few fisheries separate the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> from other hammerheads in their reported catches. This species is listed as globally Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is Endangered in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, where {{though it is a}} non-targeted species, populations have dropped 50% since the 1990s due to bycatch. It is also Endangered in the southwestern Indian Ocean, where large numbers of longline vessels operate illegally along the coasts for hammerheads and the giant guitarfish (Rhynchobatus djiddensis). The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> catch rate in Indian Ocean has declined 73% from 1978 to 2003, though it is yet undetermined whether these represent localized or widespread depletion. The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is Critically Endangered along the western coast of Africa, where stocks have collapsed with an estimated 80% decline in the past 25 years. The West African Sub-Regional Fishing Commission (SRFC) has recognized the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> as one of the four most threatened species in the region, though fishing continues unmonitored and unregulated. Off northern Australia, this species was assessed as Data Deficient but at [...] "high risk". Concern has arisen there over a substantial increase in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, reflecting the raising value of this shark's fins.|$|E

50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is a solitary, nomadic {{predator}} {{that tends}} {{to be given a}} wide berth by other reef sharks. If confronted, they may respond with an agonistic display: dropping their pectoral fins and swimming in a stiff or jerky fashion. Juveniles are preyed upon by larger sharks such as bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), while adults have no major predators except for killer whales, who hunt hammerheads of any age. Yellow jacks (Carangoides bartholomaei) have been seen rubbing themselves against the hammerhead's flanks, possibly to rid themselves of parasites. Schools of pilot fish (Naucrates ductor) sometimes accompany the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead.</b> The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> is parasitized by several species of copepods, including Alebion carchariae, A. elegans, Nesippus orientalis, N. crypturus, Eudactylina pollex, Kroyeria gemursa, and Nemesis atlantica.|$|E
50|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous, the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> rarely attacks humans. It sometimes behaves inquisitively toward divers {{and should}} be treated with respect.
