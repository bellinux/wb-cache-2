5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E

The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, {{to make them look}} older, and all <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E

Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Along {{with the}} people {{environmental}} protection consciousness enhancement, the enterprise and the family are inclined to use the green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable to reduce the environmental pollution. This paper firstly introduces the concept of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable, and then expounds thecurrent situation of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable materials, finally gives the development tendency of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable materialsin order to provide references for the related researchers. Concept of Green <b>Electric</b> <b>Wire</b> and Cable The green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable is also called environmental-friendly <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable, which is {{a new type of}} the wire and cable aggressively promoted in the world. It is characterized little environmental pollution and harm to human body in the product manufacturing and use. The main requirements of green environmental protection cable are no halogen, flame retardant, not produce toxic and corrosive gas, and not contain heavy metals, easy recycling. The main technical conditions for environmental protection type of wire and cable: Cable halogen containing heavy metals and harmful chemicals can cause the air, water and soil pollution, already is an indisputable fact.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{still had}} considerable strength when it entered southeastern Georgia. The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> throughout the region, severing communications. Damage in the Sea Islands was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000; by some accounts, the winds were {{more intense than}} in the catastrophic hurricane of 1893, but without the exceptionally high storm surge. The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations, ruining around {{a third of the}} rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people. Charlton and Camden counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of Folkston. This dealt a $500,000 blow to the turpentine industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped. In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses. Six people in Camden County were killed, including four in a logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.|$|E
5|$|HST uses {{gyroscopes}} {{to detect}} and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult. There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro, but if all gyros fail, continued scientific observations will not be possible. In 2005, {{it was decided to}} switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable.|$|E

Other Argentine cities with tram systems are Paraná and La Plata, both using the nationally built Tecnotren railbuses.

25|$|Arsenical bronze {{has seen}} little {{use in the}} modern period. It appears that the closest {{equivalent}} {{goes by the name}} of arsenical copper, being defined as copper with under 0.5wt% As, below the accepted percentage in archaeological artefacts. The presence of 0.5wt% arsenic in copper lowers the electrical conductivity to 34% of that of pure copper, and even as little as 0.05wt% decreases it by 15%. Therefore, there is no demand for copper containing arsenic in <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> etc., one of the major modern uses of copper and steam engine boilers are no longer made from it, leading to no modern use.|$|E
25|$|Hastings had {{a network}} of trams from 1905 to 1929. The trams ran as far as Bexhill, and were worked by {{overhead}} <b>electric</b> <b>wires,</b> except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter stud contact system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921. Trolleybuses rather than trams {{were used in the}} section that included the very narrow High Street, and the entire tram network was replaced by the Hastings trolleybus system in 1928–1929.|$|E

The shorter route (Blue Line; 25.7km long) serves the northeastern and western sections of the city. Most track is at grade, with its own right-of-way. The downtown portion is a shared right-of-way, serving both routes along the 7th Avenue South transit mall at street level. This portion is a zero-fare zone {{and serves as a}} downtown people mover. The tracks split at the east and west ends of downtown into lines leading to the south, northeast, west and northwest residential neighbourhoods of Calgary.

25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E
