25|$|On September 17, 2004, Mir {{was knocked}} off his {{motorcycle}} by a car. The accident caused two breaks in Mir's femur and tore all the ligaments in his knee. An Interim Heavyweight Championship was created while Mir recovered from surgery, which Andrei Arlovski won by defeating Tim Sylvia via first round submission. On August 12, 2005, the UFC learned that Mir {{would not be}} able to face Andrei Arlovski in October as scheduled and stripped him of the title after 14 months, promoting Arlovski to undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion. In 2010, Mir told FIGHT! Magazine that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the accident.|$|E
25|$|DeBakey {{initially}} {{resisted the}} surgical option, but as his health deteriorated and DeBakey became unresponsive, the surgical team opted {{to proceed with}} surgical intervention. In a controversial decision, Houston Methodist Hospital Ethics Committee approved the operation; on February 9–10, he became the oldest patient ever to undergo the surgery {{for which he was}} responsible. The operation lasted seven hours. After a complicated post-operative course that required eight months in the hospital at a cost of over one million dollars, DeBakey was released in September 2006 and returned to good health. Although DeBakey had previously refused surgery, he later stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that his surgical team performed the operation.|$|E
25|$|Juin was {{promoted}} to Général d'armée. He was given a tumultuous welcome from the populace when he entered Tunis after the Allies captured the city in May. De Gaulle appointed Mast as Resident-General in Tunisia, but Mast was injured in an air crash, and Juin was asked to fill in for him. In this role, Juin joined General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Général d'armée Henri Giraud, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder and Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson on the review stand for the victory parade on 20 May. A less savoury {{part of the job}} was informing the Muhammad VII al-Munsif, the Bey of Tunisia, that he was being deposed. When Juin was informed that Pétain had stripped him of his French nationality and membership in the legion of honour, he merely noted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> he had not been sentenced to death.|$|E

500|$|Ten {{days before}} the film's premiere, the Church of Scientology took out full-page {{advertisements}} in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear, comparing it to the story [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] published by Rolling Stone magazine. Gibney subsequently said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the church's advertising, as it had attracted much publicity for the film; he only wished [...] "they'd put in showtimes". The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that {{when she saw the}} adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: [...] "Docs don’t get full page ads, and when they do, they do really well." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{second letter}} {{was sent to}} several {{corporations}} seeking donations for a vehicle, running shoes and to cover the other costs of the run. Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed that while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> to be alive following his cancer treatment, [...] "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [...] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted." [...] The Ford Motor Company donated a camper van, while Imperial Oil contributed fuel, and Adidas his running shoes. Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions, as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.|$|E
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for his {{appearance}} as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997. The set {{was closed to}} the usual taping {{audience}} when Carey, Bader, Ferguson, Gomez and Stiles performed their striptease to The Edgar Winter Group's [...] "Free Ride". The Full Monty cast members came to the set to offer advice and watch the taping. The remainder of the episode was filmed before an audience later that same night. Gomez quipped that having two guys paint his body in make-up was [...] "more embarrassing" [...] than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode {{was the first time}} he had been [...] "totally naked" [...] since he was cast in the show. Carey admitted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers had to see his naked buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty.|$|E
500|$|Though {{originally}} intended to be shown at the Anime Evolution convention in Vancouver, Canada, the crew ran into technical difficulties. At a friend's suggestion, the film was instead revealed through viral emails on September 14, 2010, with the sender named [...] "Professor Oak" [...] attaching a small thirty-second part of the film and presenting it as a small part recorded from a [...] "secret movie trailer screening". Satisfied that the teaser had sparked interest, the full film was released on September 20. Natale stated that he {{was impressed by the}} people that had scrutinized the preview {{to determine whether or not}} it was genuine. When asked if they had any plans to produce a full movie, Majdoub stated that he would like to consider the prospects if they could receive assistance with the CGI aspects of the film, however any further production would be up to Natale. Natale in turn added that while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the positive reviews, he had no intention to do further films based on the Pokémon franchise.}} ...|$|E
500|$|Zach Gilford {{said about}} his {{character}} Matt Saracen that [...] "there are {{different parts of}} it from people I know growing up or people I'm tight with now". He credited Peter Berg with {{coming up with the}} Saracen character, and said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> to [...] "have some of the most realistic and heartfelt storylines." [...] When asked which of the actors would have been drafted highest by the NFL, he replied [...] "Probably Taylor [...] He's a good athlete, but Scott will kill me for saying that. Scott played football growing up and he has a good arm, but Taylor is faster and I think that would help his draft status." [...] Gaius Charles, who plays [...] "Smash" [...] Williams, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005, determined to find a job within a year, which he did with Friday Night Lights. He describes himself as [...] "all right" [...] at football, but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit {{order was}} {{successful}} in penetrating China and serving at the Imperial court. They impressed the Chinese with their knowledge of European astronomy and mechanics, and in fact ran the Imperial Observatory. The Kangxi Emperor was at first friendly to the Jesuit Missionaries working in China. Their accurate methods allowed him to successfully predict eclipses, one of his ritual duties. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the services they provided to him, {{in the areas of}} astronomy, diplomacy and artillery manufacture. [...] Jesuit translators Jean-François Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira took part in the negotiations of the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, where they assisted with translation. The Jesuits made an important contribution to the Empire's military, with the diffusion of European artillery technology, and they directed the castings of cannons of various calibres. The Kangxi Emperor also retained several Jesuits in his court as scientists and artists. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had made many converts. They in turn were impressed by the knowledge and intelligence of the Han Chinese Confucian scholar elite, and adapted to their ancient Chinese intellectual lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first full episode of the show that Daniels wrote. The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was [...] "very excited and intrigued" [...] with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would [...] "step up" [...] and [...] "throw himself into it". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to [...] "bring it back" [...] to character and story, unlike the previous season which got [...] "so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags". Mirkin added: [...] "I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. I had one of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, [...] "The Last Temptation of Homer", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, [...] "Bart's Girlfriend", plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals." [...] Kirkland said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that he got to work with a [...] "wonderful crew" [...] on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a [...] "wonderful" [...] director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did [...] "fine animation throughout".|$|E
500|$|N. Macleod then related how as a child, he {{had been}} close to an English smith {{employed}} at Dunvegan. One day the smith told him in secrecy that the chest in which the flag was held was to be forced open the next morning, {{and that it had}} been arranged by Hector Macdonald Buchanan that the smith would be at the castle with the necessary tools. N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present, and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone—especially the chief—what was about to be done. The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a wooden case. N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square-shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread, and several [...] "elf spots" [...] stitched onto it. After the flag had been examined, it was placed back into its case. N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the heir to the chiefship, Norman, was killed at sea. The HMS Queen Charlotte, on which he was a lieutenant, caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men. N. Macleod stated that at about the same time, MacLeod's Maidens were sold to Campbell of Ensay. He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs, which lived in the west turret of the castle. N. Macleod related how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> that the worst part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled; and that the chiefly family still owned their ancestral lands.|$|E
