5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a <b>flat</b> <b>board.</b> The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E

This is then dewatered by pressing or by {{using one of the}} Fourdriner/Magnani/Hatschek processes to form a <b>flat</b> <b>board</b> which is then heat cured under pressure (typically 10-15 bar) for periods of up to 24 hours.|$|E
2500|$|The ouija ( [...] or [...] ), {{also known}} as a spirit board or talking board, is a <b>flat</b> <b>board</b> marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words [...] "yes", [...] "no", [...] "hello" [...] (occasionally), and [...] "goodbye", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small {{heart-shaped}} piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. [...] "Ouija" [...] is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc., but is often used generically to refer to any talking board. According to Hasbro, players take turns asking questions and then [...] "wait to see what the Planchette spells out" [...] for them.|$|E

2500|$|In Visser's modification, the Acetone box was {{extended}} {{with a large}} <b>flat</b> <b>board</b> holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4×4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Acetone box. Each touch pad was sensed by an electronic circuit driving high-speed Siemens computer relays he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. [...] Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by hand (like a percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a [...] "human feel". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} structures had {{roofs of}} thatch or earth supported by flat poles. Tejas (roof tiles) were utilized in later construction (beginning around 1790) {{to replace the}} flammable thatch. The semicircular tiles consisted of clay molded over a section of a log was which well-sanded to prevent the clay from sticking. According to the accounts of Father Estévan Tapís of Mission Santa Barbara, some thirty-two Native American males were required to make 500 tiles each day, while the women carried sand and straw to the pits. The mixture was first worked in pits under the hoofs of animals, then placed on a <b>flat</b> <b>board</b> and fashioned to the correct thickness. Sheets of clay were then placed over the logs and cut the desired to size: they ranged in length from , and tapered from [...] in width. After trimming, the tiles were dried in the sun, then placed in ovens and burned until they took on a reddish-brown coloring. The quality of the tiles varied greatly among the missions {{due to differences in}} soil types from one site to another. Legend has it that the first tiles were made at Mission San Luis Obispo, but Father Maynard Geiger (the Franciscan historian and biographer of Junípero Serra) claims that Mission San Antonio de Padua was actually the first to use them. Aside from their obvious advantage over straw roofs in terms of fire retardance, the impermeable surface also protected the adobe walls below from the damaging effects of rain. The original tiles [...] were secured with a dab of adobe and were held in place because of their shape, being tapered at the upper end so they could not slide off one another.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research carried out to evaluate the defects caused by growth stresses on boards produced from Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus dunnii, using twodifferent sawing models. Logs tested came from fast growing plantations belonging to two diametricclasses. The first sawing model used aimed to produce mainly <b>flat</b> sawn <b>boards</b> and the second aimedto maximize the production of quarter-sawn boards. The results obtained pointed out that quartersawnboards were more prone to twist and bow. Splits were more evident in <b>flat</b> sawn <b>boards.</b> Bowwas only observed in <b>flat</b> sawn <b>boards.</b> As a result of the drying schedule used, collapse was not aproblem. Under the conditions of the study, regardless the species or log diameter, the best result isobtained when <b>flat</b> sawn <b>boards</b> are produced. Eucalyptus grandis was found to be a better species for producing sawnwood than Eucalyptus dunnii...|$|R

40|$|A {{collection}} of records written {{in various forms}} of native Okinawan scripts has recently been discovered at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, Japan. One of the largest collections of such artifacts in existence today, it contains <b>flat</b> rectangular wooden <b>boards</b> containing bilingual inscriptions in Japanese and Yaeyaman kaida writing, from Ishigaki; paper records in kaida writing, from Yonaguni; and wooden sticks containing sūchūma, from the main Okinawan island. The <b>flat</b> <b>boards</b> were read and described in Okinawan and mainland newspapers (Sasaki 2006), but {{the remainder of the}} collection has so far remained undescribed and undeciphered. The present paper is an English-language expansion and follow-up to the brief Japanese-language description given by the same author in the museum's magazine, Minpaku. It focuses on the paper records, with a description of the wooden sticks planned for a future article. This short paper will introduce several artifacts containing kaida writing which were recently discovered at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, Japan. The artifact collection includes two <b>flat</b> <b>boards,</b> several sheets of paper, wooden sticks, and several strings of barazan knotted rope. All of these items were used in recordkeeping in various parts of Okinawa prior to the early 20 th century. The more readable of the <b>flat</b> <b>boards</b> was reported on in the Chiba Nippō as well as in Okinawan newspapers in December 2006. The other Okinawan items were left unmentioned in the newspaper articles, and until now descriptions of them have been limited to an attempted decipherment of the papers in the July 2009 issue of the museum's monthly Minpaku magazine (Rosa 2009). The present paper is an English-language expansion and follow-up to the brief Japanese-language description given in Minpaku. It focuses only on the papers; for one of the wooden boards, see the Chiba Nippō (2006). 大阪府吹田市の民族学博物館で、各種の形に出来ている沖縄原住の文字で記された記録が発見された。これほど大きい所蔵品はなかなか無く、(1) 日本語と八重山カイダー字のバイリンガルで書いてある平らな四角い板札、(2) 与那国からだと思われるカイダー字で書いてある紙、(3) 沖縄本島から蘇州馬(スウチュウマ) で書いてある木簡がある。板札はすでに沖縄や日本本土の新聞に解読・説明された(佐々木 2006) が、残りの資料は今まで未解読でその存在はまだ出版されていない。本記事は、筆者が民族博物館の雑誌「みんぱく」に日本語で説明したものを拡大し、ここでは英語で説明する。主題は紙の資料だけで、木簡は今後の記事にしたい。論文 Article...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{obstacle}} arrangement on snowdrifts was experimentally studied at Syowa Station in Antarctica. Different patterns of snowdrift {{were obtained by}} changing the alignment of the obstacles. The author showed the distribution patterns of snowdrift {{in the case of}} a straight-line alignment of two <b>flat</b> <b>boards</b> and two different orthogonal arrangements of two <b>flat</b> <b>boards,</b> standing and lying cylinders, and a straight-line alignment of two rectangular prisms. The snowdrift was measured immediately after blizzards with maximum instantaneous wind velocity 31 to 36 m/s, mean air temperature for the period of strong wind over 20 m/s - 6 to - 10 ℃, maximum amplitude of wind direction 25 degrees and gustiness 1. 1 to 1. 3. The ridge of snowdrift in Antarctica was more distinct than that in Japan, because of the smaller gustiness and the less variation in the wind direction. The effect of the obstacles extended over the distance up to 20 to 30 times the obstacle height. This is similar to the effect of a wind break fence...|$|R

60|$|The cradle {{was simply}} a piece of <b>flat</b> <b>board,</b> {{with a bit of}} scarlet cloth {{fastened}} down each side of it. First of all, the mother laid the poor infant, which was quite naked, sprawling on the ground. A dirty-looking dog took advantage of this to sneak forward and smell at it, whereupon the mother seized a heavy piece of wood, and hit the dog such a rap over the nose as sent it away howling. Then she spread a thick layer of soft moss on the wooden board. Above this she laid a very neat, small blanket, about two feet in length. Upon this she placed the baby, which objected at first to go to bed, squalled a good deal, and kicked a little. The mother therefore took it up, turned it over, gave it one or two hearty slaps, and laid it down again.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} Frank was again at work. It took him {{all day to}} get fur and feather to lie exactly as he wished them. In the {{afternoon}} he asked the naturalist {{for a piece of}} <b>flat</b> <b>board,</b> three feet long, and a perch, but said that instead of the piece of board he should prefer mounting them in a case at once. The old man had not one in the shop large enough, and therefore Frank arranged his group temporarily on the table. On the board lay the cat. At first sight she seemed asleep, but it was clearly only seeming. Her eyes were half open, the upper lip was curled up, and the sharp teeth showed. The hind feet were drawn somewhat under her as in readiness for an instant spring. Her front paws were before her, the talons were somewhat stretched, and one paw was curved. Her ears lay slightly back. She was evidently on the point of springing. The macaw perch, which had been cut down to a height of two feet, stood behind her. The bird hung by its feet, and, head downwards, stretched with open beak towards the tip of the cat's tail, which was slightly uplifted. On a piece of paper Frank wrote, [...] "Dangerous Play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. The Greek and savage {{use of the}} turndun, or bribbun of Australia in {{the mysteries}} is {{familiar}} to students. This fish-shaped <b>flat</b> <b>board</b> of wood is tied to a string, and whirled round, so as to cause a peculiar muffled roar. Lobeck quotes from the old scholia on Clemens Alexandrinus, published by Bastius in annotations on St. Gregory, the following Greek description of the turndun, the [...] "bull-roarer" [...] of English country lads, the Gaelic srannam:(1) (Greek text omitted)". [...] "The conus was a little slab of wood, tied to a string, and whirled round in the mysteries to make a whirring noise. As the mystic uses of the turndun in Australia, New Zealand, New Mexico and Zululand have elsewhere been described at some length (Custom and Myth, pp. 28-44), it may be enough to refer the reader to the passage. Mr. Taylor has since found the instrument used in religious mysteries in West Africa, so {{it has now been}} tracked almost round the world. That an instrument so rude should be employed by Greek and Australians on mystic occasions is in itself a remarkable coincidence. Unfortunately, Lobeck, who published the Greek description of the turndun (Aglaophamus, 700), was unacquainted with the modern ethnological evidence.|$|E
