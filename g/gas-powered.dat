5|$|Till 2014, Tripura was a power deficit state. In late 2014, Tripura reached surplus {{electricity}} production capacity by using its recently discovered natural gas resources, and installing high efficiency gas turbine power plants. The state has many power-generating stations. These {{are owned by}} Tripura State Electricity Corporation (TSECL), natural <b>gas-powered</b> thermal power stations at Rokhia and Baramura, and the ONGC Tripura Power Company in Palatana. The ONGC plant has a capacity of 726.6 MW, with the second plant's commissioning in November 2014. It is the largest individual power plant in the northeast region.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{consisted of}} only ten families and met in several temporary locations {{before moving to}} a permanent building. These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street, a room above Carney's Grocery Store, and Sheehan Hall. In this interim period, the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878, with David Burgheim serving as rabbi. The Middle Eastern style building {{at the corner of}} 8th Street and 22nd Avenue, constructed by the growing congregation in 1879, was the first building in the city with <b>gas-powered</b> lighting. Rabbi Burgheim was succeeded by Rabbi W. Weinstein, then Rabbi Jacobs, and then Rabbi Judah Wechsler. Wechsler, who became rabbi in 1887, led a movement to provide public schools for blacks, which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state. The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark. The congregation stayed in this building for several years, before eventually being forced to move due to complaints of flies attracted by horse droppings outside of a nearby retail store.|$|E
25|$|Since {{electricity}} {{is an expensive}} utility, the first step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. Fluorescent lights, laptop computers and <b>gas-powered</b> refrigerators save electricity, although <b>gas-powered</b> refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the Sun Frost company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market energy star-rated refrigerator.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} major American {{cities in the}} postwar era, {{construction}} of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line {{along the length of}} Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with <b>gas-powered</b> buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.|$|E

In 2003, it produced 1931 MW of electricity from geothermal sources (27% of total electricity production), {{second only to the}} United States, and a recent discovery of natural gas reserves in the Malampaya oil fields off the island of Palawan is already being used to generate electricity in three <b>gas-powered</b> plants. Philippine gold, nickel, copper and chromite deposits are among the largest in the world. Other important minerals include silver, coal, gypsum, and sulphur. Significant deposits of clay, limestone, marble, silica, and phosphate exist.|$|E
25|$|In Estonia trams {{are used}} {{only in the}} capital, Tallinn. There has been a growing tram network in Tallinn since 1888, when traffic was started by horse-powered trams. The first line was {{electrified}} on 28 October 1925. Estonian-built electric trams were also used, with some <b>gas-powered</b> trams also used in the 1920s and 1930s. The {{last part of the}} system to be electrified was the spur to Kopli in 1951 (also converted to double track at the time) and it only was connected {{to the rest of the}} network in 1953.|$|E
25|$|A TMP mill was {{installed}} 1977, {{but not until}} a series of upgrades were completed in 1992 could the former grindstone production be scrapped {{and the need to}} buy sulfite cellulose could be dropped. PM3 became operational on 23 June 1981. The machines have been through several major upgrades, the most extensive in the late 1980s and early 2000s. A deinking mill became operational in June 2000. Proposals for PM4, which would have produced magazine paper, were abandoned after the plans to build a <b>gas-powered</b> on-site thermal power plant were scrapped by Industrikraft Midt-Norge.|$|E
25|$|Gasoline cars became ever {{easier to}} operate {{thanks to the}} {{invention}} of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks {{to the use of the}} muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of <b>gas-powered</b> vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|E
25|$|After enjoying {{success at}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed to this situation. By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large petroleum reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making <b>gas-powered</b> cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24–32km/h or 15–20mph.) and low range (30–40 miles or 50–65km), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.|$|E
25|$|Because a {{large share}} of air {{pollution}} is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power, solar power, hydro power which don't cause air pollution. Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small <b>gas-powered</b> equipment such as string trimmers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises {{to clean up the}} city's air, nearly 17nbsp&billion USD was spent. Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes {{for the duration of the}} Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations, and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers), reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles. The city further assembled 3,800 natural <b>gas-powered</b> buses, one of the largest fleets in the world. Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.|$|E
25|$|The city of Dover {{provides}} various {{utility services}} to businesses and residents. The Department of Public Works provides trash collection, recycling, water, and sewer {{service to the}} city. Republic Services provides recycling collection under contract to the city. The City of Dover Electric Department provides electricity to the city. The city's electric department {{is a member of}} the Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation, a wholesale electric utility that represents municipal electric departments in the state of Delaware. The City of Dover Electric Department generates some of its electricity from the McKee Run Generating Station, which consists of three natural <b>gas-powered</b> units that are used on a limited basis. The city also generates electricity from solar power at the Dover SUN Park, a 10 MW solar power farm on 103 acres at the Garrison Oak technology park that is owned by SunPower. The remainder of the city's electricity is purchased. Natural gas service in Dover is provided by Chesapeake Utilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8Vab unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had collector shoes fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4-TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting. in the TC unit as the 8-VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4-VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its <b>gas-powered</b> appliances so, unlike 4-REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.|$|E

500|$|The Big Lamp was a six-sided <b>gas-powered</b> public {{street lamp}} {{standing}} [...] high at the original cross-road junction of Manchester Road, Oldham Road, High Street, and Church Road. It was pulled down on 17 June 1925, when electric lighting was introduced. During the 1970s, the junction was redeveloped to accommodate the new Crompton Way bypass. A large roundabout was built, and a scaled-down replica of the original Big Lamp was erected in its centre. The new Big Lamp is electrically powered and stands about [...] high.|$|E
500|$|Carter later {{noted that}} {{the hardest part of}} [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] was casting a {{suitable}} actress for the part of Maitreya. Casting director Rick Millikan looked into every possible avenue—including strippers, porn stars, and erotic thriller/direct-to-video actresses—before settling upon Krista Allen for the role. Initially, there was a [...] "wholesome quality" [...] that bothered Carter, but as the episode was being filmed, both Carter and Millikan recognized that Allen was right for the part. In addition to the part of Maitreya, several stuntmen were needed for the episode, including doubles for Mulder and Maitreya for their martial art fight scene. Experienced gymnast Dana Heath was hired for several scenes that required Maitreya to execute a series of handstands. Fourteen stuntmen were needed to ride Kawasaki 600s and fire <b>gas-powered</b> machine-guns.|$|E
500|$|In {{the absence}} of Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, who were working on The New Avengers and Star Maidens, the role of {{production}} designer was taken up by Reg Hill. The set designs for the Altares interiors were the first that Hill had presented to Anderson since {{the making of the}} Supermarionation series Fireball XL5 in 1961. To realise Hill's concepts, the production team adapted parts of the Ultra Probe set created for the Space: 1999 episode [...] "Dragon's Domain", along with various set elements that had appeared in other episodes. Working on the mistaken assumption that his commissions were to appear in Space: 1999, uncredited effects technician Martin Bower took inspiration from the appearance of spaceships featured in the earlier series in designing and building scale models of the lightship Altares.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there were}} no public {{transport}} routes in, and few running close to, Trafford Park. Its size meant that the Estates Company was obliged to provide some means of travelling around the park, and therefore a <b>gas-powered</b> tramway was commissioned, intended to carry both people and freight. The first tram ran on 23 July 1897, but after a few days of operation there was an accident in which a tramcar was derailed, and the service was suspended until the following year. The tram's maximum speed was , and their distinctive exhaust smell quickly earned them the nickname [...] "Lamp Oil Express". The service was operated by the British Gas Traction Company, which paid a share of its takings to the Estates Company, but by 1899 the company was in serious financial difficulty, and entered voluntary liquidation. Salford Corporation then refused to provide any more gas for the trams, and the service was once again suspended until the Estates Company bought the entire operation for £2,000 in 1900. A separate electric tramway was installed in 1903, and was taken over and operated by Manchester and Salford Corporations in 1905. The takeover did not affect the gas trams however, which continued to run until 1908, when they were replaced by steam locomotives. Between 1904 and 1907 the Estates Company also operated a horse-drawn bus for the use of gentlemen staying at Trafford Hall, then a hotel. The service, available 24-hours a day, was replaced by a motor car in 1907.|$|E
