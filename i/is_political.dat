5|$|In series one, DI John Keenan {{learns that}} his estranged wife, Kate Keenan, is dating a new man. John has sex with senior crown {{prosecutor}} Rachel Barker, but quickly regrets {{his decision to}} have sex with her. Kate is then employed as a receptionist at the police station, but later attacks Rachel after she is provoked. Kate tenders her resignation, but John manages to convince her to remain at the police station. The pair later reconcile. DS Luke French works with John to take down drugs baron Neculai Stenga. DCI Harry Hutchinson acts as Neculai's informant, but John is convinced that PC Billy Jackson is the informant.

Luke agrees to put his terminally ill mother in a care home, but is later heartbroken when she dies following a fall. PC Kelly Cooper struggles with her financial difficulties and considers stealing money she finds while out on duty. Inspector Jenny Black ends her marriage with her husband, Alex Black, when she learns he is having an affair. PC Neil Parker is offered a promotion, but he is dismayed upon learning it <b>is</b> <b>political</b> as opposed to merit-based.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{provided the}} fact that he died with a bullet wound in his forehead. It was proved that it was not an accident and not a suicide. One doesn’t know. ... But what happened is very mysterious, because immediately much of the evidence was just shifted. And because it <b>was</b> <b>political,</b> so everyone <b>was</b> <b>political,</b> even the police <b>were</b> <b>political,</b> [...] not very clear.|$|R
2500|$|The {{administration}} appointed, or {{allowed to}} remain in office, 2,465 ambassadors. Most were career diplomats. 805 <b>were</b> <b>political</b> appointees. 110 of 150 ambassadorships <b>were</b> <b>political</b> in the Caribbean; [...] 259 out of 358 appointees in Western Europe <b>were</b> <b>political.</b> Career diplomats dominated all other areas including: North and Central America, South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East, East Asia, South Asia and Oceania. In Central Asia, all appointees were career.|$|R

25|$|As a {{cultural}} artifact, The Turner Diaries <b>is</b> <b>political</b> fiction that presents {{the means by}} which white nationalism (white separatism, eugenics, etc.) can be established with a race war against the perceived non-white enemies of the nation.|$|E
25|$|A platonic {{interpretation}} for {{the relationship}} between David and Jonathan has been the mainstream view found in biblical exegesis, as led by Christian writers. This argues that the relationship between the two, although strong and close, is ultimately a platonic friendship. The covenant that is made <b>is</b> <b>political,</b> and not erotic; while any intimacy is a case of male bonding and homosociality.|$|E
50|$|Pastors <b>was</b> <b>political</b> {{leader of}} the local party Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar Rotterdam), {{a member of the}} city council and also an {{alderman}} of the municipality of Rotterdam.

25|$|Another area {{in which}} there is {{extensive}} corruption in Argentina <b>is</b> <b>political</b> financing. There is an insufficient degree of transparency and accountability, and although recently passed legislation forbids donations by companies to political campaigns, there are ways for businesses to skirt the law and cover non-campaign expenses by politicians and parties. Incumbents also enjoy a decided advantage.|$|E
25|$|By July 2011 {{violence}} became at {{a record}} high in the insurgency. In late July 2011, NATO troops also handed control of Mazar-i-Sharif to local forces amid rising security fears just days after it {{was hit by a}} deadly bombing. Mazar-i-Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control, but critics say the timing <b>is</b> <b>political</b> and there is skepticism over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgency.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08, the eurozone has established and used provisions for granting emergency loans to member states {{in return for the}} enactment of economic reforms. The eurozone has also enacted some limited fiscal integration, for example in peer review of each other's national budgets. The issue <b>is</b> <b>political</b> and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change.|$|E

25|$|By the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It {{was once}} {{thought that the}} sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the Almoravid dynasty in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several {{alternative}} explanations are cited. One important reason is {{the transfer of the}} gold trade east to the Niger River and the Taghaza Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited <b>is</b> <b>political</b> instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.|$|E
25|$|In her {{introduction}} to Bone Dance, she tells us, “I {{have often been}} identified as a ‘protest poet,’ and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized, that is largely the truth.” A huge element of her poetry <b>is</b> <b>political,</b> which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements. As she puts it, “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{science fiction}} {{is focused on}} {{theories}} that include {{but are not limited}} to gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics, and reproduction. Feminist SF <b>is</b> <b>political</b> because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.|$|E

25|$|No National {{newspaper}} {{exists in}} the daily Press of Ireland, and Irish affairs are therefore treated by the existing Press from the standpoints of rival English parties. A result of this denationalising attitude <b>is</b> <b>political</b> chaos and economic impoverishment. The directors {{are convinced that the}} time is ripe for the foundation of a daily organ in the Press of Ireland which, being free from the influence of any English party, will deal with the affairs of Ireland from the Irish standpoint, and whilst asserting the National distinctiveness and independence of Ireland will promote combination and agreement amongst all political sections in Ireland on the questions of Language, Land, Taxation, Industries, Transit, Poor Law.|$|E
25|$|The {{expanding}} {{trawl fisheries}} devastated the Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) populations in Patagonia. Trawl fisheries greatly expanded {{for twenty years}} until they crashed in 1997. Pelagic squid fisheries took over which use pelagic trawls that are harmful to dusky, short-beaked common dolphins, and Commerson’s dolphins. There are approximately 21,000 Commerson’s dolphins remaining today. Two stocks {{have been identified in}} the population but genetic information and bycatch levels are unknown. With anchovy fisheries expanding, it is imperative to assess the Commerson’s dolphin population before these fisheries grow. The seasonal operation of in-shore gillnet fisheries are known to involve bycatch of cetaceans. Presently, there are no known estimates of gillnet bycatch. The bycatch problem in Argentina <b>is</b> <b>political</b> in nature. Improvements in fishing technology, awareness, and a large scale survey of Commerson’s dolphin populations and the impact of bycatch is essential.|$|E
25|$|Other modernists took up {{political}} {{positions that}} did not fit neatly into the left/right model. H.D., Mina Loy and Nathalie Barney, for instance, are now seen as proto-feminists and their openness about their various sexualities {{can be read as}} foreshadowing the 1970s view that the personal <b>is</b> <b>political.</b> H.D., especially after World War I, came to view the goal of modernism as being the bringing about of world peace. However, she also displayed anti-Semitic views in the notebooks for her book Tribute to Freud. Basil Bunting, who came from a Quaker background, was a conscientious objector during World War I, but because of his opposition to Fascism, served in British Military Intelligence in Persia (Iran) during World War II. William Carlos Williams' political views arose from his daily contact with the poor who attended his surgery. He was another for whom the personal and political blended, an approach best summed up in his statement that 'A new world is only a new mind'.|$|E

25|$|Moltmann relates {{his views}} on the trinity to three modes of human freedom. The first mode is the {{political}} meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode is rejected by Moltmann, who sees it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation of a subject with an object, where {{the goal is to}} enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of human freedom is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis of the Father and Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favors. The third mode of human freedom is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God {{in the realm of the}} Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans to be friends with God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom <b>is</b> <b>political,</b> and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film <b>is</b> <b>political,</b> Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh. I want people to go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Through late 1865, the {{southern}} states held white-only balloting and in congressional elections, chose many former rebels, most prominently Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, voted as senator by the Georgia Legislature. Violence against African-Americans was common and unpunished in the South; the new legislatures enacted Black Codes, depriving the freedmen of most civil rights. These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against the president. Stevens proclaimed that [...] "This is not a 'white man's Government!' ....To say so <b>is</b> <b>political</b> blasphemy, for it violates the fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty." ...|$|E
