Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with <b>hot</b> <b>glue.</b> Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|E
2500|$|Perfect binding {{is often}} used and gives a result similar to {{paperback}} books. National Geographic {{is one example of}} this type. Paperback or soft-cover books are also normally bound using perfect binding. They usually consist of various sections with a cover made from heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong glue. The sections are milled in the back and notches are applied into the spine to allow <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> to penetrate into the spine of the book. The other three sides are then face-trimmed. This is what allows the magazine or paperback book to be opened. Mass-market paperbacks (pulp paperbacks) are small (16mo size), cheaply made with each sheet fully cut and glued at the spine; these are likely to fall apart or lose sheets after much handling or several years. Trade paperbacks are more sturdily made, with traditional gatherings or sections of bifolios, usually larger, and more expensive. [...] The difference between the two can usually easily be seen by looking for the sections in the top or bottom sides of the book.|$|E

50|$|Hot melt {{adhesive}} (HMA), {{also known}} as <b>hot</b> <b>glue,</b> {{is a form of}} thermoplastic adhesive that is commonly supplied in solid cylindrical sticks of various diameters, designed to be melted in an electric <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> gun. The gun uses a continuous-duty heating element to melt the plastic glue, which the user pushes through the gun either with a mechanical trigger mechanism on the gun, or with direct finger pressure. The glue squeezed out of the heated nozzle is initially hot enough to burn and even blister skin. The glue is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. Hot melt adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.|$|E

25|$|The most {{simple way}} to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then <b>hot</b> <b>glued</b> together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat.|$|R
50|$|Wadding is used {{in model}} rockets to prevent the {{parachute}} from melting when it ejects. Without the recovery wadding the parachute would melt because the ejection is by a small solid-fuel engine. It gets so hot it melts <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> almost immediately.|$|E
50|$|Powder 100gms of rosin (colophony) {{and heat}} in a small pan. Beware of fire! The rosin should melt at around 90°C. Add 20 mls Venice {{turpentine}} and 60mls linseed oil, and mix well. Mix the melted rosin etc. into the <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> and stir well.|$|E
5000|$|Cover binding (generally only {{available}} on production printing models) - differs from [...] "cover insertion", in that a cover is physically {{bound to the}} book instead of simply placing it around the other pages. Cover binding often uses <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> to bind the cover to the finished book.|$|E
5000|$|A veneer hammer {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with <b>hot</b> hide <b>glue</b> in applying veneer to a substrate. The term [...] "veneer hammer" [...] is somewhat misleading, as the [...] "hammer" [...] is used more like a squeegee than a hammer. The <b>hot</b> hide <b>glue</b> is applied to the substrate, then the veneer is laid onto the glued surface. The hammer itself has a dull blade, approximately three inches wide, {{on one side of the}} head, and a square shaped face on the other side. This head is connected to a standard handle, much like a regular hammer. The small square face is designed to push down on, exerting force to the blade side of the head.|$|R
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be <b>hot</b> <b>glued</b> to the pattern to finish it.|$|R
50|$|The veneer {{is pushed}} into the glue with the wide blade, and the hammer is pushed or pulled, forcing out the excess hide glue. The sheer bulk of the metal head helps to cool the glue, causing it to grab and hold the veneer in place. The glue cures as it cools. The {{procedure}} is to work from the center, out towards the edges, forcing the <b>hot</b> excess <b>glue</b> {{out from under the}} veneer.|$|R
5000|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling {{is handled}} by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model {{of this is}} using a <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> gun to build a 3d model. The <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly {{the width of the}} extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.|$|E
50|$|Hot melt {{adhesives}} (such as <b>hot</b> <b>glue</b> sticks) and top of {{the line}} soccer cleats are usually made from EVA, usually with additives like wax and resin. EVA is also used as a clinginess-enhancing additive in plastic wraps. Craft foam sheets are made of EVA and are popularly used for children's foam stickers.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Belter {{patented}} {{a process}} for making laminated furniture. Laminated wood consisted {{of a number of}} veneer sheets bound together with <b>hot</b> <b>glue.</b> The bounded sheets were then bent under steam pressure, pressed into molds, and then carved. The process produced stronger pieces of furniture that was less costly than traditional carving and allowed for mass production.|$|E

A split core box, like it sounds, is made of two halves and has at least one hole for sand to be introduced. For simple cores that have constant cross-sections they can be created on special core-producing extruders. The extrusions are then just cut to the proper length and hardened. More complex single-piece cores can be made in a manner similar to injection moldings and die castings.Types of core ...|$|R

We propose to observe this newly predicted class of events at LHC and RHIC. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures...|$|R
50|$|While {{molten solder}} has low {{tendency}} {{to adhere to}} organic materials, molten fluxes, especially of the resin/rosin type, adhere well to fingers. A mass of hot sticky flux can transfer more heat to skin and cause more serious burns than a comparable particle of non-adhering molten metal, which can be quickly shaken off. In this regard, molten flux is similar to molten <b>hot</b> <b>glue.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps prevent the <b>hot</b> <b>glue,</b> some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. The carrier prevents the rollers from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.|$|E
50|$|Hide glue also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the glue begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may glue the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with <b>hot</b> hide <b>glue,</b> and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide glue starts to gel, {{at which point the}} glue becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide glue pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{paper cups}} for <b>hot</b> drinks were <b>glued</b> {{together}} and made waterproof by dropping {{a small amount}} of clay {{in the bottom of the}} cup, and then spinning at high speed so that clay would travel up the walls of the cup, making the paper water-resistant. However, this resulted in drinks smelling and tasting of cardboard.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hot</b> melt <b>glues</b> usually {{consist of}} one base {{material}} with various additives. The composition is usually formulated {{to have a}} glass transition temperature (onset of brittleness) below the lowest service temperature and a suitably high melt temperature as well. The degree of crystallization should {{be as high as}} possible but within limits of allowed shrinkage. The melt viscosity and the crystallization rate (and corresponding open time) can be tailored for the application. Faster crystallization rate usually implies higher bond strength. To reach the properties of semicrystalline polymers, amorphous polymers would require molecular weights too high and, therefore, unreasonably high melt viscosity; the use of amorphous polymers in hot melt adhesives is usually only as modifiers. Some polymers can form hydrogen bonds between their chains, forming pseudo-cross-links which strengthen the polymer.|$|R
