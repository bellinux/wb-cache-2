5000|$|The DSM-IV {{maintained}} the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting [...] "This pattern {{has also been}} referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or <b>dyssocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder" [...] and re-including in the 'Associated Features' text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses. The DSM-5 has the same diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. The Pocket Guide to the DSM-5 Diagnostic Exam suggests that a person with ASPD may present [...] "with psychopathic features" [...] if he or she exhibits [...] "a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold, efficacious interpersonal style".|$|E
5000|$|In 1976 {{psychiatrist}} Richard L. Jenkins, {{who wrote}} the child and adolescent behavioral disorders section of the DSM-II, pointed out that although sociopathy had become widely used as a diagnosis, {{it was not a}} diagnostic term per se in the DSM-I or II. In 1980 the full term Antisocial Personality Disorder was listed, with some of Cleckley's traits removed and new behavioral criteria in their place. Nevertheless, the term psychopath gradually came into wider clinical use, partly through the influence of Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist which revived and modified Cleckley's criteria in a criminological context. Both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 noted that [...] "The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or <b>dyssocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder." ...|$|E
5000|$|The DSM-II in 1968 rearranged the {{categories}} and [...] "antisocial personality" [...] was now listed {{as one of}} ten personality disorders but still described similarly, {{to be applied to}} individuals who are: [...] "basically unsocialized", in repeated conflicts with society, incapable of significant loyalty, selfish, irresponsible, unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences, and who tend to blame others and rationalize. The manual preface contains [...] "special instructions" [...] including [...] "Antisocial personality should always be specified as mild, moderate, or severe." [...] The DSM-II warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis, and that a [...] "group delinquent reaction" [...] of childhood or adolescence or [...] "social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder" [...] should be ruled out first. The <b>dyssocial</b> <b>personality</b> type was relegated in the DSM-II to [...] "dyssocial behavior" [...] for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits, such as racketeers, dishonest gamblers, prostitutes, and dope peddlers. (DSM-I classified this condition as sociopathic personality disorder, dyssocial type). It would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the ICD manual produced by the WHO, later spelled dissocial personality disorder and considered approximately equivalent to the ASPD diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|The Axis II Work Group of the Task Force on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) has {{expressed}} concern that antisocial personality disorder (APD) criteria are too long and cumbersome and that they focus on antisocial behaviors rather than personality traits central to traditional conceptions of psychopathy and to international criteria. R. D. Hare et al describe {{an alternative to the}} approach taken in the DSM-III—Revised (DSM-III—R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), namely, the revised Psychopathy Checklist. The authors also discuss the multisite APD field trials designed to evaluate and compare 4 criteria sets: the DSM-III—R criteria, a shortened list of these criteria, the criteria for <b>dyssocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder from the 10 th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, 1990), and a 10 -item criteria set for psychopathic personality disorder derived from the revised Psychopathy Checklist.
