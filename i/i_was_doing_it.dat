Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> mainly for the characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the issues. I knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E

[...] Hinojosa's bilingual set included {{her version of}} Guthrie's [...] "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" [...] in Spanish. In an interview with The Oklahoman, Hinojosa said: [...] "Of course, it’s wonderful.

2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore.

Johnson {{undertook}} the journey, documented in a 2001 film called Carnauba: A Son’s Memoir, in a replica Sikorsky S-38 amphibious plane like the one his father used. During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey.

2500|$|Armstrong {{has been}} criticized for his {{disagreements}} with outspoken opponents of doping such as Paul Kimmage and Christophe Bassons. Bassons was a rider for Festina {{at the time of the}} Festina affair and was widely reported by teammates as being the only rider on the team not to be taking performance-enhancing drugs. Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the 1999 Tour de France which made references to doping in the peloton. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during the 1999 Tour de France where Bassons said Armstrong rode up alongside on the Alpe d'Huez stage to tell him [...] "it was a mistake to speak out the way I (Bassons) do and he (Armstrong) asked why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> I told him that I'm thinking of the next generation of riders. Then he said 'Why don't you leave, then?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} ambitious as Lucas {{wanted to create}} fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) {{that had never been}} {{realized}} before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>it</b> was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas [...] "didn't want anything [...] to stand out, he wanted it [...] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'" ...|$|E

Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever.

2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
