5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high coarse {{aggregate}} (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The percentage of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the coarse aggregate provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E

Although Si-based electrodes have large gravimetric capacities, they typically suffer from poor cyclability. One reason for the poor cyclability is large volume expansion associated with 3. 75 mol of Li reacting with 1 mol of Si. A theoretical approach to design electrodes that can accommodate this large volume expansion is discussed. It is shown that experimental results agree well with the theoretical approach. We show that Si-based electrodes with a relatively low Si content (< 33 wt %) and <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> (33 - 56 wt %) cycle at large capacities (∼ 660 mAhg) for hundreds of cycles.

40|$|Cycle {{stability}} of MnO₂·nH₂O electrochemical capacitors (ECs) {{has been studied}} by using galvanostatic tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The extent of capacity fading, ranging from 5 to 30 % in 1000 cycles, increases with current-rate, and is markedly reduced with increasing binder content. Two fading mechanisms have been identified. With low binder content, and at high current-rate, capacity fading occurs in conjunction with appreciable increase in transmission resistance, suggesting progressively deteriorating electric contacts among the pseudocapacitive oxide particles and conductive carbon. The mechanical failure of the electrode structure may arise from the cyclic volumetric variation of the pseudocapacitive oxide particles as previously reported. With <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> or at low current-rate, capacity fading is associated with increasing interfacial charge-transfer resistance upon cycling, which has a less pronounced effect than the mechanical failure mechanism...|$|E

A systematic study of the AB/PVDF long-range electronic conductivity at different weight ratios is performed using four-probe direct current tests and the results reported. There is a wide range of AB/PVDF ratios that satisfy the long-range electronic conductivity requirement of the lithium-ion cathode electrode; however, a significant cell power performance improvement is observed at small AB/PVDF composition ratios that are far from the long-range conductivity optimum of 1 to 1. 25.

30|$|At low {{irradiation}} dose, {{the interaction}} ‘D–E’ {{is found to}} be significant. At low binder content (0.78 – 0.80), adding aluminum stearate enhances the gloss decay (Fig.  3 a, b). On the other hand, at <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> (0.85 – 0.87) aluminum stearate has no effect on the gloss decay (Fig.  3 c, d). Additionally, an increased amount of binder (automatically decreasing the amount of pigment and thus of photocatalytic material), as expected, slows down the degradation (Fig.  3 b, d). Technical stearates can contain free fatty acids (stearic acid) that can be degraded via TiO 2 photocatalysis [42, 43]. As these are smaller molecules than the oil network, decomposition into volatile components occurs faster. This effect is minor, due to the very small amount of aluminum stearate added to the paint. We propose that the effect is negligible at high oil content and noticeable at lower oil content. Consequently, when all free acids from the technical stearate have been degraded, at higher irradiation doses, the interaction becomes insignificant. This hypothesis requires the stearates to be in proximity to the pigments, which is to be expected from a wetting agent [44].|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The use of {{sustainable}} {{technologies such as}} supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), and/or recycled materials is expected to positively affect the performance of concrete mixtures. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is an innovative development of conventional concrete, which requires <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> to increase its segregation resistance. Good SCC must possess the following key fresh properties: filling ability, passing ability, and resistance to segregation. In order to reduce segregation, SCC mixes are typically designed with high powder contents, and contain chemical admixtures such as superplasticizer and viscosity modifying admixtures (VMA). This tends to increase the material cost of SCC, however one {{way to reduce the}} material cost is through adequate mix proportioning and the addition of supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash. Although advances have been made in describing concrete in terms of fundamental rheological properties, currently available rheometers are too expensive and complex for routine field use. This paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation of SCC containing sustainable technologies. Six SCC mixtures were designed in this study with content of the cementitious materials maintained constant (400 kg/m 3), while the water/cementitious material ratios ranged from 0. 40 and 0. 45. The self-compacting mixtures had a cement replacement of 50 %, 55 % and 60 % with class F fly ash for M 20 and M 25 grade of concrete. The results show that an economical SCC can be successfully developed by incorporating high volumes of class F fly ash...|$|E
40|$|This licentiate thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory experiments regarding {{the effectiveness of}} adding small amounts of binders in order to modify and improve the mechanical performance of low organic clayey silt soil. Two types of binders have been used i. e. cement and an industrial by-product named Petrit T. The study covered both the immediate and longterm effects on the soil material. <b>Binder</b> <b>content</b> was added by soil dry weight, Petrit T at 2, 4 and 7 % and cement at 1, 2, 4 and 7 %. An experimental program has been carried out, including tests of consistency limits, unconfined compressive strength, density, solidification, grain size distribution (by laser particle size analyzer) and pH. The tests were conducted on the treated soil with varying <b>binder</b> <b>contents</b> and after different curing periods, i. e. after 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 days. Results show that cement is more effective in improving the physical and engineering properties than Petrit T. Plasticity index decreases after treatment and leads to an immediate increase in workability. This is found directly after treatment and it increases with time. Soil density increased, whilst water content decreased, with increasing <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> and curing time. Particle size distribution of soil is changed toward the granular side by {{the reduction of the}} particles in clay size fraction and increasing silt size particles after 28 days of treatment. Both binder types resulted in an immediate effect on the soil pH value. This value increased to 12. 3 after adding 7 % of the binder and then it gradually decreased as curing time increased. The cement treated soil exhibits a more brittle failure behavior than the soil treated with Petrit T. In this case a more ductile behavior was observed. The findings confirmed that adding small <b>binder</b> <b>contents</b> of cement and by-product Petrit T significantly improved the physical and mechanical properties of soil, which can contribute to reduce the environmental threats and costs that are associated with using <b>high</b> <b>binder</b> <b>contents</b> in various construction projects...|$|R
40|$|Dolomite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{available}} sedimentary rocks in the territory of Latvia. Dolomite quarries contain about 1000 million tons of this material. However, according to Latvian Road Specifications, this dolomite cannot be used for average and high intensity roads because of its low quality (mainly, LA index). Therefore, mostly imported magmatic rocks (granite, diabase, gabbro, basalt) or imported dolomite are used which makes asphalt expensive. However, practical experience shows that even with these high quality materials roads exhibit rutting, fatigue and thermal cracks. The aim of the research is to develop a high performance asphalt concrete for base and binder courses using only locally available aggregates. In order to achieve resistance against deformations at a high ambient temperature, a hard grade binder was used. Workability, fatigue and thermal cracking resistance, as well as sufficient water resistance is achieved by low porosity (3 - 5 %) and <b>higher</b> <b>binder</b> <b>content</b> compared to traditional asphalt mixtures. The design of the asphalt includes a combination of empirical and performance based tests, which in laboratory circumstances allow simulating traffic and environmental loads. High performance AC 16 base asphalt concrete was created using local dolomite aggregate with polymer modified (PMB 10 / 40 - 65) and hard grade (B 20 / 30) bitumen. The mixtures were specified based on fundamental properties in accordance to EN 13108 - 1 standard...|$|R
