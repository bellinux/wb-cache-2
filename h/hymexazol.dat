40|$|Four fungicides, which active {{ingredients}} are <b>hymexazol,</b> azoxystrobin, fludioxonil and quinoline, are tested in vitro and in vivo against five isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tuberosi, causal agent of potato Fusarium wilt. Pathogen radial growth noted on PDA amended with fungicides after incubation {{for four days}} at 25 °C varied upon pathogen isolates. Mycelial growth of all pathogen isolates was significantly inhibited by fungicide PDA amendment; inhibition obtained by <b>hymexazol</b> treatment reached 77 % comparatively to untreated control. All chemical fungicides reduced disease incidence compared to the untreated control. <b>Hymexazol</b> and azoxystrobin are the most active during all the bioassay period.

40|$|Effect of some Chemical and Biological Fungicides on Mycelial Growth and Disease Severity of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Fusarium {{is among}} the most {{aggressive}} telluric fungi causing wilt and root rots in several vegetable crops. A new disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici was recorded in southern Tunisia in the "Cinquième Saison" farm, situated in Hammet Gabès during 2000 - 2001 crop season. It caused death of up to 90 % of tomato plants in some greenhouses. In the present research, the effect of 3 chemical and 4 biological fungicides was tested in vitro on mycelial growth and in vivo on disease severity of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. <b>Hymexazol,</b> benomyl and manebe were used as chemical fungicides whereas four biological products, i. e. two based on Trichoderma harzianum, one on Bacillus subtilis and another one on Bacillus thuringiensis were also tested. Among the chemical fungicides which were used, <b>hymexazol</b> and benomyl were the most effective in vitro and inhibited mycelial growth up to 80 %. However, in vivo assays showed that only <b>hymexazol</b> was effective with a reduction in disease incidence of about 76 %. In vitro, the product based on B. thuringiensis entailed a mycelial growth inhibition of less than 20 %. This value is more than 75 % higher than what was obtained through the other biological fungicides based on either T. harzianum or in B. subtilis. The efficacy of the latter 2 biological fungicides was more important in vivo assays using inoculated tomato plants. Indeed, by the use of the product based on B. subtilis, the reduction of disease incidence exceeded 95 %.

40|$|This {{disease was}} {{recorded}} in 1978 in New Zealand, and {{found to be a}} serious disease of peas in the South Island. Disease avoidance is possible, i. e. growing peas only in infested soils with low or moderate amount of inoculum. The literature on the pathogen and factors affecting development of the disease are reviewed, and these aspects studied to determine alternative control methods. When soil samples from 18 infested fields were tested by the Disease Severity Index method (DSI) and direct counting of oospores, there was a curvi-linear relationship (r = 0. 97 ***) between DSI and number of oospores in soil. These results were confirmed when a known number of oospores produced in culture were added to non-infested soil. On potato dextrose agar, growth of Aphanomyces euteiches was inhibited by water potentials between - 20 and - 30 bars depending on temperature. In glasshouse trials with infested soils, disease increased linearly between - 200 and - 3 millibars in pea plants grown at 8 °, 12 °, 16 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Yields decreased with increased moisture levels and temperatures. The disease in peas was related to both the inoculum and growth stage at time of infection. Yield was reduced by 35 % when the moisture of an infested soil was raised to field capacity (0 millibars) at 3 weeks after sowing, but yield was not affected in plants in soil raised to field capacity at the flowering or podding stages. Aphanomyces euteiches parasitised Medicago sativa, Trifolium repens, Stellaria media, Viola arvensis and Capsella bursa-pastoris in the glasshouse and field. Infected plants showed no symptoms, but the fungus could be isolated from their roots, and each of the isolates infected peas which showed typical symptoms. The effect of the fungicides, pyroxyfur, metalaxyl and <b>hymexazol</b> was assessed on Aphanomyces euteiches in vitro. Pyroxyfur at 1 ppm inhibited hyphal growth while significant reductions occurred at > 10 ppm with metalaxyl and <b>hymexazol.</b> Zoospore formation was inhibited by pyroxyfur at 10 ppm and by metalaxyl and <b>hymexazol</b> at > 100 ppm, whereas zoospore motility was inhibited by pyroxyfur and <b>hymexazol</b> at 1 ppm and metalaxyl at 5 ppm. Pyroxyfur and metalaxyl at 1 ppm significantly reduced oospore formation with <b>hymexazol</b> effective at 10 ppm. The same fungicides were tested as seed treatments in glasshouse trials. After 4 weeks of growth all treatments showed similar levels of control. After 12 weeks growth, with soil of DSI 50, the disease was significantly reduced by metalaxyl (- 26 %) and <b>hymexazol</b> (- 45 %), but with soil of DSI 100, no differences were observed. In the same trials, fungicide combinations did not improve the efficacy of seed treatments. In a separate trial, pyroxyfur treated seed grown in soil with DSI 100 reduced DSI significantly (- 18 %) after 6 weeks with root dry matter being increased by 39 % and total dry matter by 23 %. Significant increases in top dry matter occurred at 2 weeks 0 (+ 44 %) and 8 weeks (+ 78 %). There were no significant interactions between the fungicide treatments, moisture levels (- 200, - 28 and - 3 millibars) and temperatures (20 ° and 24 °). Growing Brassica napus in infested soils for 4 months reduced the DSI; from originally 58 to 27, from 72 to 53, and from 81 to 56. There was no change in DSI when Triticum aestivum, Trifolium repens or no plants were grown in the same soils. When dried leaves and stems of 5 brassica species were incorporated (0. 5 % of the soil dry weight) into infested soil, there were significant reductions in DSI and oospore numbers. The trend in reductions with length of time of incorporation was similar with greater effect from 6 weeks incorporation compared to 3 weeks. With soils of DSI 50, 75, and 100, the mean effect of Brassica napus, Raphano-brassica and Sinapis alba were equally effective, reducing DSI by 32 - 38 % and oospore numbers by 66 - 72 %. When the same brassica species were grown for 6 months in infested soils and subsequently the roots alone incorporated into the soils for 6 weeks, there was an average reduction of 41 % in DSI and 56 % in oospore numbers by Brassica oleraceae, Brassica napus and Raphano-brassica. This cultural method, by reducing inoculum, is of value in the control of aphanomyces root rot...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas putida 40 RNF {{applied to}} seed pellets reduced the {{occurrence}} of Pythium damping-off of sugar beet. A density of 6 × 107 40 RNF per pellet reduced Pythium damping-off from 70 to 26 % when seeds were sown in artificially infested soil (250 propagules Pythium ultimum per g dry soil). The efficacy of 40 RNF was dependent on its density in the seed pellet (in the range 2 × 104 - 6 × 108 per pellet) and {{on the number of}} propagules of Pythium in soil. 40 RNF declined to or stabilized at approximately 1 × 106 per pellet 3 days after planting, and this was independent of the inoculum density.

HIS Pythium species were isolated from 37 % of the soils surveyed, with mean population levels ranging from 4. 3 – 1422 CFU g− 1 dry weight. Eight HIS Pythium taxa were recovered on the VP 3 H 50 medium, the most abundant of which was P. vexans (found in 29 % of field soils surveyed). Seasonal variations in population levels of HIS Pythium species were studied in four fields over a period of 12 months.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{and environmental}} requirements for mycelial growth, oospore production and germination of Pythium oligandrum were examined. Optimum temperatures for growth of several isolates {{were in the}} range of 20 - 30 0, with little growth occurring below 100 or above 350 Oospore germination occurred over the range of 10 - 35 °. Both growth and oospore germination occurred over the range of pH 4. 5 - 9. 0 and were optimum between pH 6. 0 - 7. 5. Growth was reduced markedly below - 1. 0 to - 1. 5 MPa osmotic potential and ceased at approximately - 2. 5 to - 3. 5 MPa; similar results were obtained for oospore germination. Growth and oospore germination were affected more by low matric than by low osmotic potentials. Oospore production required an exogenous supply of sterols; it was also increased by the presence of calcium and affected by the C:N ratio. Semi-solid, static and aerated culture systems were developed for bulk production of P. oligandrum oospores. A liquid cane molasses medium was particularly convenient and efficient. A range of formulations were prepared using oospores produced mainly in this medium. Formulations were evaluated against pathogens causing damping-off in cress and the level of biocontrol in artificially infested sand was not as good as that obtained in naturally infested soil. Alginate pellets and a perlite preparation survived well in laboratory storage at 5 - 25 ° for at least 24 wk. Seeds of cress and sugar beet were coated with oospores using commercial seed-pelleting and film-coating procedures. Both types of seed treatment reduced damping-off of cress caused by P. ultimum in artificially infested sand and potting compost, and by Rhizoctonia solani in artificially infested sand. In general, pelleting of P. oligandrum on cress gave better control than film-coating treatments. P. oligandrum also reduced damping-off of sugar beet in soil naturally infested with Aphanomyces cochlioides and Pythium spp [...] Control was equivalent to that achieved with <b>hymexazol</b> fungicide seed-coating treatments and was related to the inoculum potential of A. cochlioides in the soil...|$|E
40|$|Soilborne fungal {{diseases}} {{threaten the}} viability of the Australian processing beetroot industry. Globally, Pythium spp., Aphanomyces cochlioides and Rhizoctonia solani are the predominant soilborne fungal pathogens responsible for a root rot complex in beet crops. In Australia, the disease problems have been exacerbated in recent years because crops are now grown virtually year round, and under environmental conditions favourable to infection. This has lead to increased inoculum levels in soils sown to beetroot. Moreover, nowhere in the world does there seem to be a single strategy that is completely efficacious in controlling these pathogens, so an effective management strategy will almost certainly involve a combination of tactics. The most likely combination seems to involve fungicide seed treatments, rotations of gramineous or biofumigant crops and the use of disease-resistant varieties of beet. The first of these, fungicidal seed dressings, are a cost-effective means of reducing pathogen inoculum and protecting young beets from infection. <b>Hymexazol</b> may be particularly useful in the Australian system, since it is active against both Pythium and Aphanomyces. To combat Rhizoctonia, it should be applied in combination with either pencycuron or toclophos methyl. Second, rotations of gramineous crops, such as maize or oats, or biofumigant brassica crops, such as white mustard, brussel sprouts or cabbage should also reduce the build-up of inoculum and offers a tactic to relieve the problem in the longer term. Third, alternative beetroot cultivars with resistance to Rhizoctonia have now been developed in USA breeding programs and should be considered by the Australian industry. Resistant varieties are potentially very useful since they offer a long-term approach to disease management that can be easily incorporated into existing production systems. Fourth, the alteration of sowing dates to avoid periods of high disease risk (e. g. confining sowing to the cooler, drier months) needs to be seriously considered by the Australian industry if it is committed to disease management. There is also evidence to suggest that seed priming may warrant consideration as a tool to use in combination with fungicide dressings to reduce disease in young plants. Biological seed treatments and soil fumigation appear to be tactics of limited value to the Australian beet industry...|$|E
