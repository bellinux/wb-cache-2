5000|$|The rosy wolfsnail {{lives for}} {{approximately}} 24 months. This species found naturally {{in the southern}} portion of the United States, usually in hardwood forests and urban gardens. This species is a fast and voracious predator, hunting and eating other snails and slugs. The smaller species of prey are ingested whole. This gave it the nickname [...] "the cannibal snail". The predatory snail uses slime trails to track its prey and potential mates, resulting in the rosy wolfsnail following these trails more than 80% {{of the time they}} are alive. The rosy wolf snail prefers to consume smaller snails because it is quicker and easier to eat the smaller snails. These prey snails include like the O'ahu tree snail and other small snails native to Hawaii and other Polynesian islands. When prey is found the rosy wolfsnail usually consumes the prey snail whole. The snail has also been seen to quickly suck the prey snail out of its shell which is slower than simply swallowing the prey snail whole. The snail is able to do this because it has no <b>jaw</b> <b>plate.</b> The snail is also specialized for carnivory, the mouth of the snail (buccal mass) being totally contained within a beak like structure (rostrum) that can be extended thus allowing the toothed tongue (radula) to be ejected past the mouth and into the snail’s prey. The radula is also adapted to be larger and have specialized the teeth into elongated cones.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving <b>jaw</b> <b>plate</b> at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw crusher. <b>Jaw</b> <b>plate</b> wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{stiffness}} of swing plates {{has not been}} varied with changes in rock strength. Rock strength has only been of interest {{because of the need}} to know the maximum force exerted by the toggle for energy considerations. Thus a swing plate, stiff enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (q_u) of up to 308 MPa, may be overdesigned (and, most importantly, overweight) for crushing a softer fragmental limestone, amphibolites. Design of lighter weight jaw crushers will require a more precise accounting of the stresses and deflections in the crushing plates than is available with traditional techniques. Efforts to decrease energy consumed in crushing have lead to consideration of decreasing the weight of the swing plate of jaw crushers for easily crushed material. In the present work the design of the swing <b>jaw</b> <b>plate</b> using point-load deformation failure (PDF) relationships along with interactive failure of rock particles as a model for such a weight reduction.

40|$|The {{teeth of}} sea urchins are {{connected}} to the calcareous <b>jaw</b> <b>plates,</b> known as pyramids, by a ligament consisting of collagen fibers and microfibrils synthesized by fibroblasts in the aboral growth zone of the tooth. This ligament needs to be sufficiently stiff to hold the teeth firmly when the animal scrapes hard surfaces, but also needs to be flexible enough to allow the teeth to move outwards during growth. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the growth and stiffness of sea urchin teeth, we have examined the ultrastructural organization of the supporting structures of Lytechinus variegatus teeth. Electron microscopy showed that collagen fibrils were mechanically attached to the column-like structures in the tooth, to produce a firm, irreversible connection. The ligament-attaching region in the jaws was formed by cavities that ramificated in the deep portions. The collagen fibrils were not mechanically linked to the jaws. These findings suggest that the stiffness of the ligament is mediated by chemical bonding between the collagen fibrils and the jaw surface. The cavities present in the pyramids greatly increased the surface area and strengthened the area for the bonding of collagen fibrils...|$|R

25|$|In general, the {{alimentary}} {{system of}} Bothriolepis –which includes the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– {{can be described}} as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>plates.</b> Posteriorly from the mouth, the alimentary system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso-ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. It must be noted that the flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the alimentary system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in elasmobranchs and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.|$|R

40|$|At {{the current}} state of the art, endoprostheses are {{predominantly}} manufactured by cutting, forming or casting technologies. Another, rather new way of implant manufacturing is the Additive Manufacturing process called Beam Melting, using a Laser or Electron beam. In particular the customized production with no need for any type of tooling, combined with the unique freedom of design spark interest in this technology for implant manufacturing. The use of Beam Melting enables the fabrication of endoprostheses with almost any design of inner and outer geometries. Previous developments and research activities were focussing either on customized, patient specific implant designs with a production batch size of only one piece, or on structured surfaces of specific design for better bone ingrowth and improved stability of the implant-bone bonding. Both approaches have not yet reached a significant breakthrough for Additive Manufacturing as an adopted technology to produce (metal) implants, besides some niche applications, e. g. for individual cranial or <b>jaw</b> <b>plates</b> or some Electron Beam Melting series production of hip cups. This paper focuses on the integration of completely new features and functions into endoprostheses which give various added value opportunities to implants that where unthinkable before. Strategies from tooling applications of Additive Manufacturing were adopted which have proved very successful in giving added value to tools and dies by implementing complex inner cooling channels. The paper describes two innovative strategies to integrate new features and functions into standard implants, e. g. hip stems, by the creation of: - inner design features like functional channels and cavities and - surface and inner structures to integrate additional active components (e. g. shape memory alloys) The inner channels and cavities (inner design features) can fulfil various functions within the implant, e. g. local supply of bio-resorbable filler, prevention and treatment of implant loosening even years after implantation, post-operative medical treatment through a medication depot and supply channels, post-operative drainage of blood and wound oozing through the implant, endoscopic examination of implant-bone interface and surrounding tissue and easier and quicker explantation with less damage to the bone structure through local application of soluble. In non-cemented hip implants, stem loosening is mainly caused by a change in force application and insufficient load transmission between implant and osseous anchor bedding. The target is to achieve a homogeneous force distribution at the implant-bone interface by using shape-memory-alloys. The active components were integrated in hip stems with a new designed surface and inner structures. The results proved that the frictional connection between a stem prosthesis anchored without cement and the femur can be achieved using shape memory alloy elements. So there is a potential to stabilize the prosthesis and increase is useful life...|$|R
