25|$|Laumer's books do not portray one {{consistent}} {{version of}} Oz. Because {{most of his}} books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's visions of Oz {{which may have been}} inconsistent with his own. For example, while he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in A Fairy Queen in Oz, he had her physically eight in Aunt <b>Em</b> <b>and</b> Uncle Henry in Oz; and while he portrayed Volkov's Oz as a parallel universe in Farewell to Oz he also showed Volkov's characters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as Aunt <b>Em</b> <b>and</b> Uncle Henry in Oz. Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are consistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in others.|$|E

25|$|Neurological {{problems}} following tick bites {{were recognized}} {{starting in the}} 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström {{was the first to}} propose <b>EM</b> <b>and</b> neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{computer}} software typically has support {{for many more}} characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit character encoding, and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to <b>em</b> <b>and</b> en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.|$|E

40|$|In the Lower Yellow River Delta, soil {{salinity}} {{is a problem}} due {{to the presence of}} a shallow, saline water table and marine sediments. Spatial information on {{soil salinity}} at the field level is increasingly needed, particularly for better soil management and crop allocation in this area. In this paper, a mobile electromagnetic induction (EMI) system including <b>EM</b> 38 <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 is employed to perform field electromagnetic (<b>EM)</b> survey, <b>and</b> fast determination and quantitative evaluation of the spatial pattern of soil salinity is discussed using the field EM survey data. Optimal operation modes of <b>EM</b> 38 <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 are determined to establish multiple linear regression models for estimating salinity from apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa). Spatial trend and semivariogram are illustrated and spatial distribution of field salinity status is further visualized and quantitatified. The results suggest that ECa (<b>EM</b> 38 <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31) data is highly correlated with salinity, and that the interpretation precision of soil salinity at various layers can be improved using <b>EM</b> 38 h <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 h (where h represents the horizontal mode of EM measurement). Both <b>EM</b> 38 h <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 h exhibit significant geographic trend. Nested spherical models fit the semivariance of <b>EM</b> 38 h <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 h better than single spherical models. Spatial autocorrelation of EM 31 h is stronger than that of <b>EM</b> 38 h, <b>and</b> short-range variation is the chief constitute of spatial heterogeneity for both <b>EM</b> 38 h <b>and</b> <b>EM</b> 31 h. Quantitative classification shows that soil salinity exhibits the trend of accumulation in the root zone. In 0 - 1. 0 Â m solum, heavy salinized and saline soils are the predominant soil types, accounting for 54 % and 41 % of total survey area, respectively. The area of light and moderate salinized soils is comparatively small, which accounts for only 0. 4 % and 4. 6 %, respectively.

25|$|Carl Lennhoff, {{who worked}} at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, {{believed}} many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he used a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, <b>EM</b> <b>and</b> Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Western Aukštaitian dialect, {{unlike other}} dialects of Lithuanian, {{preserves}} the mixed diphthongs an, am, en, <b>em</b> <b>and</b> the ogonek vowels ą and ę. The dialect is subdivided into Kaunas and Šiauliai sub-dialects. The Kaunas sub-dialect, {{in contrast to}} the Šiauliai sub-dialect, in most cases separates long and short vowels and stresses word endings {{in the same way as}} standard Lithuanian. Since they had close economic contacts with East Prussia, people from Suvalkija borrowed a number of German words. There are efforts to preserve, record, and promote the local dialects. Between 2003 and 2006 the Science and Encyclopaedia Publishing Institute published a three-volume dictionary of Zanavykai sub-dialect. Since 1973, Šakiai district municipality organizes an annual Language Day to encourage preservation of the sub-dialect.|$|E

25|$|The tonic key of {{the song}} is F major (although, since McCartney tuned his guitar down a whole step, he was playing the chords {{as if it were}} in G), where the song begins before veering off into the key of D minor. It is this {{frequent}} use of the minor, and the ii-V7 chord progression (<b>Em</b> <b>and</b> A7 chords in this case) leading into it, that gives the song its melancholy aura. The A7 chord {{is an example of a}} secondary dominant, specifically a V/vi chord. The G7 chord in the bridge is another secondary dominant, in this case a V/V chord, but rather than resolve it to the expected chord, as with the A7 to Dm in the verse, McCartney instead follows it with the IV chord, a B. This motion creates a descending chromatic line of C–B–B–A to accompany the title lyric.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 & 4 June 1870. With Grace {{and his brothers}} <b>E.M.</b> <b>and</b> Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly {{became one of the}} best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6–86 and 6–20. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire.|$|E
