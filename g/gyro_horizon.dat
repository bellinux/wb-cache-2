5000|$|An {{attitude}} indicator (AI), {{also known as}} <b>gyro</b> <b>horizon</b> or artificial horizon or attitude director indicator (ADI, when it has a Flight Director), is an instrument used in an aircraft to inform the pilot of {{the orientation of the}} aircraft relative to Earth's horizon. It indicates pitch (fore and aft tilt) and bank (side to side tilt) and is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Flight Magazine's {{issue of}} 3 April 1959 [...] {{reported}} [...] "Captain Waldo Lynch, the pilot-in-command, {{said that the}} aircraft went into a sharp manoeuvre downward and to the right. At 17,000ft the airspeed was over 400 kt, the electric trim button was inoperative, and his <b>gyro</b> <b>horizon</b> had tumbled. The co-pilot, recounted that [...] "At 2200Z the navigator posted a change in heading requiring left turn. Used autopilot turn knob.

5000|$|Neil Campbell, {{the lone}} survivor, was a Canadian citizen. At {{the time he}} said he had no memory of the actual crash, but [...] "woke up" [...] in the water. Many private vessels sortied from Papeete harbor that night with more joining at first light to aid in the search for survivors. The bodies of several of the flight attendants were the only ones recovered. Speculation at the time at Pan Am on the cause of the {{accident}} also considered a catastrophic windshield failure, as well as <b>gyro</b> <b>horizon</b> instrument failure. No conclusive cause was ever determined.|$|E
40|$|The Peripheral Vision Display (PVD) which {{presents}} the pilot with a <b>gyro</b> stabilized artificial <b>horizon</b> projected onto his instrument panel by a laser light source is outlined. During instrument flight conditions, such a display allows the pilot to gain attitude awareness by sensing the horizon line through his peripheral vision. The pilot can detect changes to aircraft attitude without continuously referring {{back to his}} flight instruments. A second generation PVD unit was installed in the USAF/Calspan NT- 33 A during late 1982. An NT- 33 A flight evaluation of the display provides {{a unique opportunity to}} utilize a Workload Assessment Device (WAD) to obtain quantitative data regarding the utility of the PVD in reducing pilot workload. The experimental design and procedures for a two phase NT- 33 PVD flight evaluation program is described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Remote sensing {{satellites}} {{are required}} to meet stringent pointing and drift rate requirements for imaging operations. For achieving these pointing and stability requirements, continuous and accurate three-axis attitude informa-tion is required. Inertial sensors like gyros provide continuous attitude information with better short-term stability and less random errors. However, gyro measure-ments are affected by drifts. Hence over time, attitudes based on the gyro refer-ence slowly diverge from the true attitudes. On the other hand, line-of-sight (LOS) sensors like horizon sensors provide attitude information with long-term stability. Their measurements however {{are affected by the}} presence of random instrumen-tal errors and other systematic errors. The limitations of inertial and line-of-sight sensors are mutually exclusive. Hence, by optimal fusion of attitude information from both these sensors, it is possible to retain the advantages and overcome the limitations of both, thereby providing the precise attitude information required for control. This paper describes an improved earth-pointing scheme by fusion of the three-axis attitude information from <b>gyros</b> and <b>horizon</b> sensor roll and pitch measure-ments along with yaw updates from the digital sun sensor. A Kalman Filter is used to estimate the three-axis attitude by online estimation and corrections of various errors from the sensor measurements. Variations in orbit rate components are also accounted for using spacecraft position and velocity measurements from the satel-lite positioning system. Thus precise earth-pointing is achieved...|$|R
5000|$|The Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express aircraft, {{owned by}} the USAAF and {{operated}} using a United Airlines crew, was transferring Japanese men, women and children of the Consular Corps, to exchange for Allied POWs. On 2 August 1943, it took off from Whenuapai Aerodrome runway 04 at 2:20 am, with rain and fog conditions at minimums for departure, and quickly passed through low stratus. Captain Herschel Laughlin’s <b>gyro</b> <b>horizon</b> had inadvertently been left caged [...] - [...] while the instrument displayed level flight, the aircraft entered a steepening bank to the left. The crew detected the problem in a few seconds, but as the aircraft was straightening up and levelling out, it hit the ground at about 322 km/h, bounced {{a few times and}} exploded. The third bounce threw its first officer, R. John Wisda, out through the canopy; he rolled end over end about 100 m through mud and reeds. A medic later found him trying to keep warm near a burning tyre. The major factors of the accident were the lack of a pre-flight checklist, and crew fatigue (126 flying hours in the last 26 days).|$|E
5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{may develop}} small [...] "precession" [...] errors, in pitch indication during {{extended periods of}} acceleration or deceleration and, in bank indication during extended periods in a turn, caused by the mechanism that normally keeps the gyro rotor properly erected. These errors develop very slowly (usually at not more than 2 or 3 degrees per minute) and are not significant in normal flying. Some attitude indicators can only tolerate a specific range of bank angles. If the aircraft rolls too steeply or achieves an extreme pitch attitude — while performing aerobatics, for example — the attitude indicator can [...] "tumble" [...] (or [...] "topple") and become temporarily unusable. For this reason, some attitude indicators are fitted with a [...] "caging mechanism" [...] (a device to restore the gyroscope to an erect position). Some attitude indicators can be manually erected once the airplane is in level flight using the caging mechanism. Most modern instruments are designed to tolerate 360 degrees of rotation in pitch and roll without tumbling, although periods of violent aerobatics may tumble any <b>gyro</b> <b>horizon.</b> [...] Once tumbled, an instrument without a caging mechanism {{may not be able}} to re-erect itself until power is removed and the aircraft is in a level pitch and roll attitude for a long enough period that the gyro rotor comes to a stop.|$|E
