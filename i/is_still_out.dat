5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, after further {{evidence}} {{was written in}} the record and the prosecution and defense made their closing statements, Ward formally sentenced Heirens to three life terms. As Heirens waited to be transferred to Stateville Prison from the Cook County Jail, Sheriff Michael Mulcahy asked Heirens if Suzanne Degnan suffered when she was killed. Heirens answered:I can't tell you if she suffered, Sheriff Mulcahy. I didn't kill her.

25|$|Amarthiel's captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon {{he leads}} an army out of Annúminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player {{attempts}} to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the Trollshaws. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has already found Narchuil. However, Elrond does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> there, and Laerdan knows where.|$|E

25|$|Leibniz {{also wrote}} a short paper, Primae veritates, first {{published}} by Louis Couturat in 1903 (pp.518–523) summarizing {{his views on}} metaphysics. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the mythical}} island of Okoto, the Mask Maker {{brothers}} - Ekimu and Makuta - forged masks of elemental {{power for the}} island's villagers. However, jealous of his brother's higher-rated craftsmanship, Makuta broke an ancient vow by forging a mask {{with more than one}} element; the Mask of Ultimate Power. Putting it on, the mask took control over him and began to destroy the island, forcing Ekimu to confront him. Knocking the mask off Makuta's face, a shock wave from the battle rolled across Okoto and sent both brothers into an endless sleep, while their masks - the Mask of Creation and the Mask of Control, as well as the Mask of Ultimate Power - were scattered across the island. After the leaders of the villages, the Protectors, buried Ekimu, Okoto was overran with Skull Spiders searching for the powerful masks. On the brink of giving up hope, the Protectors send a prayer they heard from whispers from Ekimu's lifeless body to the skies during a celestial alignment, resulting in six powerful heroes, the Toa, to crash-land on the island. Each masters of a sacred element, the Toa - Tahu, Kopaka, Pohatu, Gali, Onua and Lewa - are quickly enlisted by the Protectors in their battle against the Skull Spiders as well as embarking on a quest to find their golden Masks of Power that are the key to unlocking their full elemental abilities. Once claimed, the Toa meet for the first time outside the ancient city of the Mask Makers. Defeating the Lord of Skull Spiders upon arrival, they venture inside in search of the resting place of Ekimu. Battling an army of skeleton warriors under the control of Makuta's surviving spirit, the Toa overcome their ranks before finding Ekimu's tomb and awakening him. However, the leader of the skeleton warriors, the Skull Grinder, has obtained Ekimu's Mask of Creation. Donning it, he defeats the Toa with ease and damages their masks, but their efforts give Ekimu the time to recreate his Hammer of Power and defeat the Skull Grinder by knocking the mask off his face. Donning his sacred mask once again, Ekimu recreates the Toa's golden masks, while they all agree that Makuta <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> there; readying for his next attack.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E
2500|$|Sean Egan from BBC Music {{said that}} [...] "Many {{of the songs}} are amongst the strongest chart hits of the new millennium, {{especially}} Williams’ collaborations with Guy Chambers". Egan said that [...] "The sequencing is bizarre but has its own kind of logic, working backwards chronologically" [...] and as [...] "the familiar tunes go by, one is {{struck by the fact}} that Williams is both underrated [...] and overrated." [...] He also stated that had Williams [...] "not been sacked by Take That, he would never have been motivated to prove himself with edgy, knowing music light years beyond the boyband." [...] Egan concluded his review by saying that [...] "If this compilation is closing a chapter, the jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> on whether the next one is going to be a gripper." ...|$|E

He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{the striker}} steps {{in front of}} the crease to play the ball, leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat on the ground behind the crease, and the wicket-keeper is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball, then the striker is out. A stumping is most likely to be {{effected}} off slow bowling, or (less frequently) medium-paced bowling when the wicketkeeper is standing directly behind the stumps. A stumping is the only method of dismissal, from a wide delivery that the bowler gets credit for on the scoreboard. As wicket-keepers stand several yards back from the stumps to fast bowlers, stumpings are hardly ever effected off fast bowlers. [...] But a keeper may throw down the stumps and the batsman <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> stumped if he is out of his ground, but not attempting a run. [...] Similarly, the ball can bounce off a keeper (but not external non-usual wicketkeeping protective equipment, like a helmet) and break the stumps and still be considered a stumping.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} was the centrepiece at Spectrum London gallery in September 2006 in the Go West exhibition and priced at £30,000. The show at Spectrum London was the Stuckists' first {{show in a}} commercial gallery in the West End of London. The Spectrum London director, Royden Prior, said people shouldn't {{just look at the}} politics, but should look beyond them because [...] "These artists are good, and are part of art history," [...] Jane Morris wrote in The Guardian, [...] "If the stuckists go down in art history, and the jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> as to whether they will, Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision by stuckist co-founder Charles Thomson may well become their signature piece." [...] The Evening Standard said some people would see the display of the painting as revenge against Serota, after he had rejected the Stuckists' offer to donate work to the Tate; it also mentioned that the Stuckists had first drawn attention to the Tate's purchase of The Upper Room by Chris Ofili, a Tate trustee, which had led to the Tate being censured by the Charity Commission in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, [...] "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA {{production}} {{that seems to be}} the fate of most Idol winners. It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> there, you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E
