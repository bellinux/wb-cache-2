60|$|Now {{the earl}} understood, and the shadow on his <b>face</b> <b>shook</b> <b>and</b> lifted, and his teeth gleamed. His triumph might be short-lived, {{but he would}} enjoy it while he could.|$|R
6000|$|Out of the {{heaviness}} of {{that long}} sleep Nod opened his eyes, to find Thumb's great body stooping over him with anxious <b>face,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> pommelling him, and muttering harshly: [...] "Wake, wake, Nugget of clay! Wake, Mulla-slugga! The Valleys! The Valleys, little Ummanodda! Taste, taste! Ummuz, ummuz, UMMUZ!" ...|$|R
60|$|Charles, though {{filled with}} rising fury, was sober {{enough to know}} in what danger he stood, and forcing a smile to his <b>face,</b> <b>shook</b> hands <b>and</b> went out to his carriage--alone.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} Ida, who {{put her hand}} before her <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> her head.|$|R
60|$|Mr Meagles again {{stroked his}} <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> his head, {{with an air}} of {{profound}} regret.|$|R
60|$|Neuman was livid of <b>face</b> now <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> {{all over}} his huge frame.|$|R
60|$|To {{his great}} concern Mrs. Blossom put her {{handkerchief}} over her <b>face,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>shaking</b> with suppressed laughter, {{rose from the}} table and left the cabin.|$|R
6000|$|Young Harvey {{seemed much}} taken {{back as he}} <b>faced</b> Rose, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> hands in current angular fashion. His mind {{formulated}} these opinions: ...|$|R
60|$|In {{two minutes}} we were <b>faced,</b> had <b>shaken</b> hands, <b>and</b> had {{finished}} with {{such topics as}} rain, prosperity, health, residence, and destination. Politics might have followed next; but I was not so ill-fated.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly, with livid <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> hand, Cole pointed westward. [...] "There! Dene and his band! See, {{under the}} red wall; see the dust, not ten miles away. See them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Jim {{thrust his}} <b>face</b> forward <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> his open hand, bent like a claw, under Mr. Polly's nose. [...] "Not your {{blooming}} business," [...] he said. [...] "You got to shift." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{made him}} sit up, and then Oak began wiping his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> himself like a Samson. [...] "How can I thank 'ee?" [...] {{he said at}} last, gratefully, some of the natural rusty red having {{returned}} to his face.|$|R
60|$|Twice {{we walked}} up and down and all over the wharf. He flashed his lantern into all the dark corners, into empty barrels and boxes, and then he turned and flashed it right into my <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> his 'ead at me.|$|R
60|$|Mr Burton and Bluenose {{were already}} {{seated at the}} table. Bax stood near the {{fireplace}} bending down to Mrs Foster, who was looking up in his <b>face,</b> <b>shaking</b> his hand, <b>and</b> thanking him, with tears in her eyes, for having saved her son's life! Bax was much perplexed by {{this view of the}} matter, taken and obstinately held to by the widow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dreams, dreams, dreams, my simple Colonel," [...] said Bletson, though, {{his pale}} <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> limbs belied the assumed courage {{with which he}} spoke. [...] "Old Chaucer, sir, hath told us the real moral on't--He was an old frequenter of the forest of Woodstock, here"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were coming}} to see me, were you, sir?" [...] Bows said, and {{came in with a}} sad <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> hands with Arthur. [...] "Plague on that old man!" [...] {{somebody}} thought in the room: and so, perhaps, some one else besides her.|$|R
60|$|His fat {{face was}} wreathed and creased with merriment. But the others, how sick, how heart-sick, were they all! The women cried. The men turned away in that silence which is beyond tears. Monsieur Fardet fell upon his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> with dry sobbings.|$|R
60|$|Slowly Astok {{withdrew from}} the {{presence}} of his father. With white <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> limbs {{he made his way}} to his own palace. As he crossed the courtyard his glance chanced to wander to the great east tower looming high against the azure of the sky.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir, no,' {{returned}} the Master, showing his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> his head, <b>and</b> rubbing {{his hands in}} great agitation. 'No, sir. No. I have remembered myself, I--no, Mr. Creakle, I have not forgotten myself, I--I have remembered myself, sir. I--I--could wish you had remembered me a little sooner, Mr. Creakle. It--it--would have been more kind, sir, more just, sir. It would have saved me something, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor, evading his eye, {{pulled a}} long <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> his head. [...] "It {{may be the}} cooking," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I’m not a good cook, I admit. It might be {{something}} got into the food from the medicine-chest. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if the mates are taken bad too." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} pacify Dora, but {{she turned away}} her <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> her curls from side to side, and said, 'You cruel, cruel boy!' so many times, that I really did not exactly know what to do: so I took a few turns {{up and down the}} room in my uncertainty, and came back again.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas {{burst in}} upon {{them with a}} white <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> limbs. He gasped out his tale of the event in a voice of terror, and both {{brothers}} affected to be shocked, dismayed and incredulous. But {{the worst part of}} that old man's news, the true cause of his terrible agitation, was yet to be announced.|$|R
6000|$|He stopped these angry reproaches {{with a wave}} of his hand, {{and sobbed}} out, raising his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> his melancholy head at his younger daughter, 'Amy, I know that you are {{innocent}} in intention. But you have cut me to the soul.' 'Innocent in intention!' the implacable Fanny struck in. 'Stuff in intention! Low in intention! Lowering of the family in intention!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, it was so; but of late it {{has become}} so {{inundated}} with invalid Asiatics and valetudinarian Persians, that the simultaneous influx of the handsome heroes who swarm in from the islands to look after their daughters, scarcely compensates for the annoying presence of their yellow <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> limbs. No, I think, on the whole, Paphos is my favourite.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Benoit, the door. M. Andre-Louis Moreau to the door!" [...] The tone argued an {{irrevocable}} determination. Pale and self-contained, {{but with}} a queer pain at his heart, Andre-Louis heard that dismissal, saw Benoit's white, scared <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> hands half-raised {{as if he were}} about to expostulate with his master. And then another voice, a crisp, boyish voice, cut in.|$|R
60|$|Upon hearing this, Thompson {{assumed a}} very long <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> {{his head as he}} turned his eyes first towards the husband and then towards the wife, and shrugged his shoulders, and {{compressing}} his lips, blew out his breath, as though in this way he might blow off some of the mingled sorrow and indignation with which the gentleman's words afflicted him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Paul,' rejoins his sister, {{with her}} {{handkerchief}} to her <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> her head, 'I know your great spirit, and will {{say no more}} upon a theme so painful and revolting;' on the heads of which two adjectives, Mrs Chick visits scathing indignation; 'but pray let me ask you--though I dread to hear something that will shock and distress me--that unfortunate child Florence-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better {{close the}} front door," [...] cried Holmes, {{and we all}} rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible {{worrying}} sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> limbs came staggering out at a side door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do they? Your {{knowledge}} of women goes {{as far as}} that, does it? Tell me fairly;--do {{you think you know}} anything about women?" [...] Madalina as she asked the question, looked full into his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> her locks <b>and</b> smiled. When she <b>shook</b> her locks <b>and</b> smiled, there was a certain attraction about her of which John Eames was fully sensible. She could throw a special brightness into her eyes, which, though it probably betokened nothing truly beyond ill-natured mischief, seemed to convey a promise of wit and intellect.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} glance he started back so {{suddenly}} that he almost dropped the lamp, and a deadly pallor overspread his <b>face.</b> His knees <b>shook,</b> <b>and</b> heavy drops of sweat came on his forehead, and he trembled like an aspen. But {{he was young}} and plucky, and pulled himself together, and after the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the lamp, and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and now stood out clearly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so," [...] said Cora, {{drawing a}} long breath, as if {{reviving}} from a trance, raising her <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> back her shining veil, with a kindling eye, that contradicted the death-like paleness of her countenance; [...] "but why--it is not permitted us to inquire. There is yet one of thine own people {{who has not}} been brought before thee; before thou lettest the Huron depart in triumph, hear him speak." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no reply, {{and the old}} man's face {{stiffened}} into a wild surprise. He knocked heavily {{again and}} got no reply, and, with a white <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> hand, he flung {{the door open and}} gazed at the empty bed. His hand dropped to his side; his head turned slowly from the bed to the open window; he rushed forward and looked out on the ground, where he saw the tracks of a man.|$|R
60|$|Jerry, {{left alone}} in the mist and darkness, {{dismounted}} meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until {{the wheels of the}} mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.|$|R
60|$|The {{other night}} I lectured for a Vienna charity; {{and at the}} end of it Livy and I were {{introduced}} to a princess who is aunt to the heir apparent of the imperial throne--a beautiful lady, with a beautiful spirit, and very cordial in her praises of my books and thanks to me for writing them; and glad to meet me <b>face</b> to <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>shake</b> me by the hand--just the kind of princess that adorns a fairy tale and makes it the prettiest tale there is.|$|R
60|$|Of all {{the bitter}} day, {{it was the}} very bitterest moment. Happy Mr. Stuart lay upon the pebbles with his back against the ribs of his camel, and chuckled consumedly at some joke which those busy little cell-workers had come across in their repairs. His fat face was wreathed and creased with merriment. But the others, how sick, how heart-sick, were they all! The women cried. The men turned away in that silence which is beyond tears. Monsieur Fardet fell upon his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> with dry sobbings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't let him room in {{your part}} of the house; that is to say, not sleep there; but I thought, as you was comin' home, and I better be airin' it up some, anyway, I might as well let him set in the old Judge's room. If {{you think it was}} more than I had a right to do, I'm willin' to pay for it. Git up!" [...] Bolton turned fully round toward his horses, to hide the {{workings}} of emotion in his <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> the reins like a desperate man.|$|R
