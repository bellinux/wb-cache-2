40|$|Object of {{this work}} is the issue, of how the cartel law can grasp those cases that are {{suitable}} for an exemption of Art 101 (3) TFEU. The reason for this investigation is the reform of the EU cartel procedural law from may 2004. The reform puts up {{the question of whether}} the abolishment of the registration-system in favor of the system of a self-assessment leads to uncertainty in the application of the law. First, the work investigates if certain cases are never fit for an <b>individual</b> <b>exemption.</b> Second, the work tries to set up positive types of cases that are fit for an exemption from Art 101 (1) TFEU. To achieve those goals the work investigates the jurisdiction of the Commission, the ECJ and the Court to separate cases that are clearly fit for an <b>individual</b> <b>exemption</b> from those that are not. The work comes to the conclusion that through the jurisdiction of the Commission the room for the application of the <b>individual</b> <b>exemption</b> is clear in most cases.

Second, I shall elaborate on the structure of Article 101 TFEU. As a consequence of the "more economic approach" taken by the Commission and the repeal of the <b>individual</b> <b>exemption</b> system under Article 101 (3) TFEU, the distinction between the concept of object offences and the concept of effect offences is slowly disappearing while having detrimental implications for legal certainty. Moreover, the conceptual distinction between considerations of ancillary restraints under Article 101 (1) TFEU and consideration of pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects under Article 101 (3) TFEU is slowly disappearing as well.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three papers on land use economics and regulation. The first paper reviews numerous past literatures on how land-use regulation, agricultural subsidies, and use-value assessment method affect land values. The second paper uses a theoretical model to analyze how imposing minimum-lot-size zoning and different designs of minimum-lot-size zoning policies affects land value. The third papers use land data from Oregon to investigate the price effect of minimum-lot-size zoning and potential impact of Measure 37 and 49. The first essay reviews an extensive collection of literature from most major applied economics journals in recent years. These past studies attempted to investigate the impacts of various land use policies, including minimum-lot-size zoning, open space protection, wetland conservation, etc. These studies demonstrate how land use policies might affect residents' land consumption, social welfare, land markets, local government finance, and urban development patterns. Various econometric and mathematical models {{have been used to}} overcome problems related to modeling and data, such as spatial correlation. The objective of the second essay is to investigate the effect of the minimum-lot-size zoning on land values versus the value of individual exemptions from the regulations. The study first assumes all residents live in a monocentric city and have the same income constraints, and then assumes that there are two income groups living in the monocentric city. Minimum-lot-size zoning is applied to the periphery of the city. As stated in the study by Jaeger and Plantinga (special report, June 2007), distinguishing between two concepts - the change in property value due to regulation and the value to a landowner of an <b>individual</b> <b>exemption</b> to a regulation – is important to estimate the potential impact of Measure 37 and 49. Therefore, this study will explore both cases: 1) the removal of minimum-lot-size zoning from all parcels, and 2) having a single parcel exempted from zoning. Both open-city and closed-city scenarios will be considered. The comparative statics will show how the zoning policy influences urban land values. In addition, a simulation will help to demonstrate the impact of policy changes. The third essay uses the two-stage hedonic model to estimate the demand for lot size. The first stage estimation allows us to estimate the marginal impact of zoning policies, while the second stage estimation is used to investigate how land values are affected by the non-marginal change in zoning policies, such as the elimination of zoning or changes related to Measure 37. In the first stage estimation, the zoning policy is assumed to have two conflicting impacts on the land value; the regulation reduces development opportunities while it also may provide more environmental benefits. In the empirical model, four Oregon counties are considered as separate land markets, and the distribution of consumers' tastes are assumed to be the same across the counties. This provides a tool for solving the identification problem in the second stage estimation...|$|E

Because of the fact that under certain circumstances state aid can affect the economic competition among concurrents both within a member state and within the internal market of the EU and thus have a significant bad influence on it, art. 107 subsection 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states a general interdiction of providing state aid by the memeber states. It defines state aid as financial aid in any form (direct grant, soft loan, tax allowance, interest subsidy etc.), payed out of financial ressources belonging to the state ("state" defined in a large sense as both the central state sphere and local government sphere), which give preferential treatment to certain companies or certain production sectors and thereby affects or may affect competition, and lastly which have an influence on business between the member states (have an effect on the internal market). Of course there have to be exemptions from this general interdiction.

Consistent with previous work, the projections employed two key model runs from the 2009 bigeye tuna assessment (run 10 and run 14) combined with two assumptions regarding future bigeye tuna recruitment (SRR recruit and AV recruit). A total of 11 projection scenarios were devised and the key indicators (F/FMSY and SB/SBMSY in the terminal year of the projections) estimated for each scenario/assessment model/recruitment assumption combination. For the most part, the <b>individual</b> <b>exemptions</b> have a relatively modest impact on the indicators.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three papers on land use economics and regulation. The first paper focuses on {{the environmental impacts of}} land use and their implications for the design on water quality trading policies. The second and third papers address local land use regulations and their impact on land values and land use patterns. The first paper provides a national-scale, watershed-level assessment of land use impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystems in the United States. The results suggest that the level of conventional water pollution in a watershed is significantly affected by the amount of land allocated to intensive agriculture and urban development, while the level of toxic water pollution is significantly affected by the amount of land allocated to transportation and mining. Implications of the results for the design and implementation of water quality trading policies are discussed. The second paper develops an empirical framework to conduct an exploratory analysis of effects of land use regulations on land values and land use patterns in a GIS-based landscape near Eugene, Oregon. All the land use regulations considered in this study, including exclusive farm use zoning, forest zoning, urban growth boundary designation, residential density zoning, commercial zoning, and industrial zoning, are found to affect land value and use both inside and outside of the designated zones. While there are many issues this framework does not address, preliminary results indicate that regulations (except commercial zoning) tend to increase the value of land outside the designated zones, but reduce the value of land inside the designated zones. The framework is applied to measure the reduction in value due to regulations vs. the value of <b>individual</b> <b>exemptions</b> at the parcel level to illuminate the controversy surrounding Oregon's Measure 37. The reductions in value due to regulations are found to be considerably smaller than the values of <b>individual</b> <b>exemptions</b> for almost all regulations contested in the Measure 37 claims. The third paper evaluates the efficiency of the current system of land use regulation, analyzes the possible changes to the regulatory structure, and studies the role of spatial and temporal interaction among neighboring land uses...|$|R

For introduction into the matter, the opening part is dedicated to the explanation of the term copyright law, its position in the Czech legal system and the main principles it lies upon. This broad explanation is subsequently followed by definition of its fundamental terms - author's work and its use. The crucial part of the work lies in the fourth chapter, which bears the same title as the work itself. The structure of this chapter follows the organisation of the Czech Copyright Act. After description of the free work, the paper gets to {{the interpretation of}} <b>individual</b> <b>exemptions</b> and limitations to copyright, thus the institutes of free use and statutory licences.

The 1999 Commission Decision was valid till 2009 and from 2010 the Commission has reopened its third competition investigation to the Pooling Agreement and the IGA and it is still in process. It is of interest at this time to systematically review the pre- 1999 Commission’s competition measures to the IG and map out the prospects of the Pooling Agreement and the IGA under the Commission’s reopened probe. The dissertation seeks to offer a comparative analysis of the 1985 and 1999 Commission Decisions, in which approach divergences and deficiencies are addressed. Based on this retrospection, the post- 1999 variation of legal environments related to the ongoing Commission’s probe is illuminated and then a reappraisal of the Pooling Agreement associated with the IGA is made under the shifted analytic framework. The purpose of this dissertation is partly to look back at history, providing legal comments on the EU’s competition measures to the Pooling Agreement and the IGA, and partly to look to the future, offering prospects and suggestions in consideration of potential lobbying by the parties concerned...|$|R

This Article suggests a third perspective, namely, that Hobby Lobby harms, rather than helps, religious freedom. Both legally and politically, Hobby Lobby is likely to lead to a reduction in protection for religious individuals and entities that have traditionally been included under the Free Exercise Clause and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This is particularly troubling because the Hobby Lobby decision is legally flawed. The Article takes seriously the reality that many religious people do not experience religion as a divisible phenomenon that they can separate from the rest of their lives. Sometimes this requires exemptions to generally applicable laws if there is a legal mechanism for doing so, but cases involving large, for-profit entities like Hobby Lobby raise additional concerns. In these cases, religious <b>individuals</b> seek <b>exemptions</b> in the name of the company, which imposes the owners’ religious tenets on corporate employees. This creates a confrontation between “lived religion” and the legal or civil rights of others. Over time, as courts create precedent in cases involving for-profit entities, the rights of religious individuals and religious entities will likely be weakened. Moreover, the legislative, legal, and public response to Hobby Lobby does not bode well for religious accommodation claims in the long run, and, sadly, will have a negative impact on accommodation claims brought by religious individuals and entities...|$|R

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Establishes a new state tax, resulting in unknown additional tax revenues for the state, which would be offset by the costs of collection of the new tax by the Franchise Tax Board, {{and the development of}} a system of enforcement. The costs would probably be less than the revenues generated by the new tax; thus the measure would result in unknown net revenues to the state, possibly millions of dollars annually...|$|R
