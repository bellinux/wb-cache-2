5|$|By early 1862, {{a single}} general, Albert Sidney Johnston, {{commanded}} all the Confederate forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap, but his forces were spread too thinly {{over a wide}} defensive line. Johnston's left flank was Polk, in Columbus with 12,000 men; his right flank was Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 4,000 men; the center consisted of two forts, Forts Henry and Donelson, {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, also with 4,000 men. Forts Henry and Donelson were the sole positions defending the important Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively. If these rivers were opened to Union military traffic, two <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> paths would lead into Tennessee and beyond.|$|E

By taking control of these forts, Americans not only gained heavy artillery, but control of a vast water highway, as well: Lake Champlain provided a <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> route to British Canada.

In this case, the tumor in the small intestine was considered a hematogenous metastasis of the gastric cancer because (1) this tumor was histologically {{the same as the}} gastric cancer, (2) there was no peritoneal dissemination, and (3) hematogenous spread is more typical and often includes the adrenal gland, liver, and bone.|$|R
25|$|The Qin army led a <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> into Wei by besieging {{its capital}} Daliang but soon {{realized}} that the city walls were too tough to break into. They devised a new strategy in which they utilized {{the power of a}} local river that was linked to the Yellow River. The river was used to flood the city's walls, causing massive devastation to the city. Upon realizing the situation, King Jia of Wei hurriedly came out of the capital and surrendered it to the Qin army in order to avoid further bloodshed of his people.|$|E
25|$|The {{war began}} in December 1759 when 40,000 Burmese troops led by Alaungpaya {{and his son}} Hsinbyushin invaded down the Tenasserim coast from Martaban (Mottama). Their battle plan was {{to go around the}} heavily defended Siamese {{positions}} along shorter, more <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> routes. The invasion force overran relatively thin Siamese defenses in the coast, crossed the Tenasserim Hills to the shore of the Gulf of Siam, and turned north towards Ayutthaya. Taken by surprise, the Siamese scrambled to meet the Burmese in their south, and put up spirited defensive stands en route to Ayutthaya. But battle-hardened Burmese forces overcame numerically superior Siamese defenses and reached the outskirts of Siamese capital on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese command decided to withdraw. An effective rearguard operation by Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta allowed for an orderly withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|Rulers of {{subordinate}} {{towns like}} Iyin-Ekiti (Uyin Alelagba) and Are-Ekiti were brothers and {{relations of the}} Ewi who co-existed and led their respective townships as co-ordinate lesser cities of Ado-Ekiti. They ruled in those towns {{with a view to}} creating stability for the Ewi who was a ruler of higher importance in the main city, Ado-Ekiti, while his brothers are rulers over lesser Ado towns where they maintained required importance and role to preserve the Ewi’s realm and achieve an equation of substance and stability against Ewi’s potential regional neighbours. The existence of these chieftains help to preserve Ewi’s interest and to protect Ado-Ekiti from <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> by any ambitious adventurer since the chiefs represent Ewi’s interest in those subordinate and neighbouring towns, farm settlements, hamlets and subordinate towns. The headship of most of these towns was selected from the ruling lineage that was created by the senior chiefs, subject to the ratification of the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti.|$|E

500|$|The Árbenz {{government}} originally {{meant to}} repel the invasion by arming the military-age populace, workers' militias, and the Guatemalan Army. Resistance from the armed forces, {{as well as}} public knowledge of the secret arms purchase, compelled the President to supply arms only to the Army. From {{the beginning of the}} invasion, Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily and expressed this confidence in public. But he was worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> by the U.S. military. This also contributed to his decision not to arm civilians initially; lacking a military reason to do so, this could have cost him the support of the army. Carlos Enrique Díaz, the chief of the Guatemalan armed forces, told Árbenz that arming civilians would be unpopular with his soldiers, and that [...] "the army [...] do its duty".|$|E
2500|$|Plant virus {{transmission}} {{from generation}} to generation occurs in about 20% of plant viruses. When viruses are transmitted by seeds, the seed is infected in the generative cells and the virus is maintained in the germ cells and sometimes, but less often, in the seed coat. When the growth and development of plants is delayed because of situations like unfavourable weather, there is an increase in the amount of virus infections in seeds. [...] There {{does not seem to be}} a correlation between the location of the seed on the plant and its chances of being infected. [...] Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the transmission of plant viruses via seeds, although it is known that it is environmentally influenced and that seed transmission occurs because of a <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> of the embryo via the ovule or by an indirect route with an attack on the embryo mediated by infected gametes. [...] These processes can occur concurrently or separately depending on the host plant. It is unknown how the virus is able to directly invade and cross the embryo and [...] boundary between the parental and progeny generations in the ovule.|$|E

60|$|Buller, like White, had to {{take the}} {{situation}} as he found it. It is well known that his own belief was that the line of the Tugela was the true defence of Natal. When he reached Africa, Ladysmith was already beleaguered, and he, with his troops, had to abandon the scheme of <b>direct</b> <b>invasion</b> and to hurry to extricate White's division. Whether they might not have been more rapidly extricated by keeping to the original plan is a question which will long furnish an excellent subject for military debate. Had Buller in November known that Ladysmith was capable of holding out until March, is it conceivable that he, with his whole army corps and as many more troops as he cared to summon from England, would not have made such an advance in four months through the Free State as would necessitate the abandonment of the sieges both of Kimberley and of Ladysmith? If the Boers persisted in these sieges they could not possibly place more than 20,000 men on the Orange River to face 60, 000 whom Buller could have had there by the first week in December. Methuen's force, French's force, Gatacre's force, and the Natal force, with the exception of garrisons for Pietermaritzburg and Durban, would have assembled, with a reserve of another sixty thousand men in the colony or on the sea ready to fill the gaps in his advance. Moving over a flat country with plenty of flanking room, it is probable that he would have been in Bloemfontein by Christmas and at the Vaal River late in January. What could the Boers do then? They might remain before Ladysmith, and learn that their capital and their gold mines had been taken in their absence. Or they might abandon the siege and trek back to defend their own homes. This, as it appears to a civilian critic, would have been the least expensive means of fighting them; but after all the strain had to come somewhere, and the long struggle of Ladysmith may have meant a more certain and complete collapse in the future. At least, by the plan actually adopted we saved Natal from total devastation, and that must count against a great deal.|$|E

40|$|Central to the {{pathology}} of malaria disease are the repeated cycles of parasite invasion {{and destruction of}} human erythrocytes. In Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent species causing malaria, erythrocyte invasion involves several specific receptor-ligand interactions that direct the pathway used to invade the host cell, with parasites varying in their dependency on these different pathways. Gene disruption of a key invasion ligand in the 3 D 7 parasite strain, the P. falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homolog 2 b (PfRh 2 b), resulted in the parasite invading via a novel pathway. Here, we show results that suggest the molecular basis for this novel pathway is not due to a molecular switch but is instead mediated by the redeployment of machinery already present in the parent parasite but masked by the dominant role of PfRh 2 b. This would suggest that interactions <b>directing</b> <b>invasion</b> are organized hierarchically, where silencing of dominant invasion ligands reveal underlying alternative pathways. This provides wild parasites {{with the ability to}} adapt to immune-mediated selection or polymorphism in erythrocyte receptors and has implications for the use of invasion-related molecules in candidate vaccines...|$|R
