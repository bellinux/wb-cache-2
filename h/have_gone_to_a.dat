5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shootout, {{but under the}} first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, {{but the next day}} saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an upper body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E

5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. The first Test was played in Barbados and Headley was selected, making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930—to the disapproval of some Barbadians who thought his place should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local player. Batting at number three, he played aggressively in the first innings but the crowd barracked him and he was bowled for 21. However, in the second innings he scored 176, becoming the first West Indian to score a century on his Test debut and only their second centurion overall. He shared century partnerships with both Clifford Roach and Frank de Caires, but these were insufficient to force victory, and the match was drawn. Headley remained in the Test side {{for the rest of the}} series, the only home player other than Roach to appear in all four Tests. In Trinidad, during the second Test, Headley found the unfamiliar conditions difficult—Trinidad was the only Test match ground in the Caribbean which was played on a pitch made from matting instead of grass. Headley scored eight and 39 as West Indies lost the match. The home side levelled the series with their first ever Test victory in the third match of the series, played in British Guiana. In this match Headley became the first West Indian, and only the fifth cricketer of any nation, to score two separate hundreds in a Test match. His first innings of 114 was played mainly in support of Roach, who scored a double century. In the second innings, Headley scored 112 as West Indies batted with a big first innings lead, attacking defensive English bowling.|$|E

25|$|Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes {{plans to}} escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she {{is willing to}} go to prison so she can {{eventually}} reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises they <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him {{that there should be no}} more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered in cuts and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again.|$|E
500|$|Despite his team's defeat, Bolton manager Bruce Rioch {{praised the}} {{performance}} of Liverpool: [...] "I'm delighted for Roy, if you're going to lose in a cup final then the winner couldn't <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> better club." [...] Rioch also stated that the final [...] "was great for the town and great for the people." [...] Bolton would return to Wembley in May when they progressed to the First Division play-off final. A 4–3 win secured promotion to the Premier League for the following season. Liverpool's victory earned them qualification into European competition, the 1995–96 UEFA Cup. They would finish the 1994–95 season in fourth place in the Premier League, 15 points behind eventual winners Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
500|$|Producer Wayne Young {{said his}} passion for the {{environment}} was his motivation for making the film, saying the film was [...] "blatantly environmental, although we <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of trouble to avoid preaching. We also {{want it to be}} viewed as entertainment." [...] The inspiration for FernGully came from stories written by his former wife, Diana Young. Diana first wrote the story of FernGully 15 years before the film's release. Wayne said the couple planned a film adaptation for five years, then spent [...] "seven years of dreaming and hustling, followed by another three years of production". Wayne stated their dream was not possible until the success of Walt Disney Feature Animation's 1989 film The Little Mermaid, which brought popularity back to animation. Hand drawn scenes in the film were complimented by computer animation, which was used to create elements such as flocks of birds that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally. Kroyer states 40,000 frames of computer animation were used in the film, and that the use of such animation halved the production time. Most of the film's $24 million budget was spent on the animation and the soundtrack.|$|E
