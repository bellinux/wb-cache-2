50|$|In {{the large}} intestine, {{the passage of}} the digesting food in the colon is a lot slower, taking from 12 to 50 hours until it is removed by defecation. The colon mainly serves as a site for the {{fermentation}} of digestible matter by the gut flora. The time taken varies considerably between individuals. The remaining semi-solid waste is termed feces and is removed by the coordinated contractions of the intestinal walls, termed peristalsis, which propels the excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit via defecation from the anus. The wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles, the taeniae coli, and an inner layer of circular muscles. The circular muscle keeps the material moving forward and also prevents any back flow of waste. Also of help in the action of peristalsis is the basal electrical rhythm that determines the frequency of contractions. The taeniae coli can be seen and are responsible for the bulges (<b>haustra)</b> present in the colon. Most parts of the GI tract are covered with serous membranes and have a mesentery. Other more muscular parts are lined with adventitia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The study {{reported}} in this paper analyses, by computer simulation, factors affecting the features (amplitude, frequency and phase lag) of the slow waves of the extracellular myoelectrical activity of the human ascending colon. It takes into account both the anatomic and functional aspects of the colon <b>haustra,</b> the myoelectrical dynamics of the cells and the geometric modification of <b>haustra</b> ’ configuration. The variable sacculated geometry of the colon wall, segmented into typical <b>haustra,</b> has been represented by a sequence of truncated round ellipsoids. According to the propagation of the front of depolarization-repolarization of the cells, slow waves are simulated by the cyclic movement of an annular band polarized by electrical dipoles oriented perpendicularly {{with respect to the}} surface of the ellipsoids and activated by a pacemaker. The simulation highlighted that the amplitude of the slow waves physiologically depends on the dipole moment of cells, and the frequency depends on the velocity of the polarized annular band. In addition, the amplitude, the frequency and the phase lag also depend on the dynamic modification of the geometrical factors (colon length and haustrum radius). Furthermore, the simulation results showed that the shape of the slow wave and the amplitude of its peaks depend on the inter-electrode distance and on th...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{regulation}} of the motility between the <b>haustra</b> and taenia coli was studied in the isolated rabbit proximal colon. Four types of haustral and taenial preparations were used: the haustral strip without the taenia coli (type 1), the haustral strip including the taenia coli (type 2), the L-shaped (taenia-haustra) preparations for recording the haustral (circular) response to taenial stimulation (type 3) and the L-shaped (haustra-taenia) preparation for recording the taenial (longitudinal) response to haustral stimulation (type 4). Field electrical stimulation induced a contractile response in the <b>haustra</b> and taenia coli. Hexamethonium reduced the contraction in type 2, 3 and 4 preparations. The desensitization to serotonin reduced the response in type 2 and 3 preparations. After atropinization, the response in types 1 and 4 was reversed to relaxation, and the response in types 2 and 3 was reversed to relaxation followed by contraction which was reduced or abolished by indomethacin. The responses remaining after atropinization in all types of preparations were not affected by other blocking agents tested or desensitization to neuropeptides. Tetrodotoxin abolished all relaxation and contractile responses in all types of preparations. These {{results suggest that the}} indirect contractile response to field stimulation is induced mainly via cholinergic and serotonergic neurons, and that the relaxation is mainly mediated by nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurons. The late haustral contractions after atropine may be caused by endogenous prostaglandin. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} colonic ultrasonography (US) in assessing the extent and activity of disease in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and to compare US findings with clinical and endoscopic features. Study design: Consecutive pediatric patients (n =  60) with a diagnosis of UC and suspected disease flare-up were prospectively enrolled; of these, 50 patients were eligible for the study. All underwent clinical evaluation, bowel US with color Doppler examination and colonoscopy. Blind US was performed the day before endoscopy in all patients. The US assessed variables were bowel wall thickness > 3  mm, bowel wall stratification, vascularity, presence of <b>haustra</b> coli, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Results: The endoscopic extent of disease was independently confirmed in 47 patients by US that yielded a 90 % concordance with endoscopy (95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 96). Multiple regression analysis showed that US measurements with an independent predictive value of severity at endoscopy were increased bowel wall thickness (P < . 0008), increased vascularity (P < . 002), loss of <b>haustra</b> (P = . 031), and loss of stratification of the bowel wall (P = . 021). Each variable was assigned a value of 1 if present. The US score strongly correlated with clinical (r =  0. 94) and endoscopic activity (r =  0. 90) of disease (P < . 0001). Conclusions: Colonic US is a useful first line noninvasive tool to assess the extent and activity of disease in children with UC and to estimate the severity of a flare-up, prior to further invasive tests. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|No {{abstract}} available. Article truncated at 150 words. A 34 year-old male inmate presents with {{chest pain}} 10 {{years prior to}} admission. His prior chest x-ray shows only mild thickening of the right paraspinal stripe (Figure 1). Chest x-ray on admission 10 years later shows a large right mixed density paramediastinal mass silhouetting the right pulmonary artery and right paratracheal stripe (Figure 2). This was confirmed to be a massive esophagus on thoracic CT scan (Figure 3). The patient was eventually diagnosed with achalasia. A number of disorders can present with a massive esophagus including achalasia, esophagectomy with colonic interposition, scleroderma, esophageal carcinoma with stricture, and esophagitis with stricture (1). Diagnostic imaging findings using fluroscopy, CT and X-ray can help differentiate these disorders.

40|$|Twenty {{species of}} late Middle Ordovician conodonts {{including}} two new forms, Erraticodon bellevuensis sp. nov. and Ansella? <b>haustra</b> sp. nov., are described and illustrated from allochthonous limestone {{blocks in the}} Oakdale Formation of the Bell River Valley, N.

The co-occurrence of Paroistodus horridus, Histiodella kristinae and Appalachignathus delicatulus in the fauna suggests the limestone was originally deposited in late Darriwilian (most likely early-mid Da 3) time, providing a maximum age constraint on its inclusion in the Oakdale Formation. Some faunal similarities are apparent between this conodont fauna and that from (1) allochthonous limestone clasts within the Fairbridge Volcanics below the Wahringa Limestone Member and (2) contemporaneous deep-water cherts in basinal turbidite facies of the Adaminaby Group. The latter similarity suggests that prior to downslope displacement into the Oakdale Formation, the original depositional environment of the limestone was on an unstable outer shelf edge rather than in shallow water depths. 35 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Turner {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal disease frequently associated with autoimmune disorders including diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease and {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). Although the etiology of IBD has not been fully elucidated, genetic analysis has recently revealed several susceptibility genes. Recently, cases with Turner syndrome associated with IBD have been reported. We report here a 13 -yr-old girl with Turner syndrome associated with ulcerative colitis. The patient was undergoing growth hormone treatment and presented with abdominal discomfort and bloody diarrhea. Her karyotype pattern was 46,X,i(Xq). Barium enema revealed punctate collections of barium suggesting microulcerations in the descending and sigmoid colon with loss of <b>haustra.</b> Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed that the mucosa was erythematous and friable upon touch and that the wall had frank hemorrhage and inflammatory polyp formation from the anal verge through the splenic flexure. Histologically, mucosal and submucosal inflammation was prominent, suggesting cryptitis and crypt abscess formation. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, and 5 -aminosalicylic acid, prednisolone and dietary therapy were initiated. Our observations in this patient suggest that X chromosome abnormality may influence the development of IBD and that screening for gastrointestinal disease in patients with Turner syndrome may help lengthen life expectancy in these patients.

30|$|A 68 -year-old {{man with}} a history of laparoscopic intersphincteric {{resection}} of the rectum with diverting loop ileostomy for lower rectal cancer suffered from anastomotic stenosis requiring repeated endoscopic dilatation. His loop stoma was not reversed because these treatments were unsuccessful. He denied having a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Twelve years postoperatively, he developed a perineal abscess requiring drainage. Subsequently, he developed a high-grade fever, bloody discharge per anus, and skin ulcers in the right ankle and around the stoma. Because culture tests were negative for bacteria, it was deemed that his acute illness reflected an inflammatory response rather than an infectious disease. Colonoscopy revealed anastomotic stenosis, a colonic fistula, and mucosa that hemorrhaged easily, with lacerations. A pathological examination with biopsy revealed inflammatory infiltration without malignancy. After reviewing the patient’s clinical episodes and discussing the case with physicians in multiple specialties, we performed total colectomy with end ileostomy in accordance with the abdominoperineal resection. The postoperative course was uneventful. A resected specimen showed atrophic mucosa with the disappearance of <b>haustra</b> in the distal colon, as well as edematous and dilated mucosa in the proximal colon. The pathological diagnosis was suggestive of UC, including erosion and ulceration in edematous wall, crypt abscess, and inflammatory infiltration into the mucosa. The skin ulcers in the right ankle and around the stoma healed over time.|$|E
40|$|Rabbits produce {{hard and}} soft faeces in a {{circadian}} rhythm. This study was undertaken {{in order to}} examine the motor function of the colon in relation to the formation of these two types of faeces. Colonic motility was measured in unanaesthetized rabbits using strain-gauge transducers and simultaneous radiography. Three types of contractions were found in the rabbit proximal colon: haustral activity, segmental activity, and mass peristalsis. Distinctly different motor patterns were observed during the formation of hard and soft faeces. When hard faeces were produced, the motor activity of the proximal colon was enhanced. It consisted of segmental and haustral activity. The segmental contractions separated the digesta into faecal pellets and forced them slowly aborad, whereas the movements of the <b>haustra</b> carried the liquid contents back towards the caecum. When soft faeces were produced haustral and segmental activity was reduced and transfer of the digesta through the proximal colon was accelerated by mass movements. In contrast to the proximal colon, the motility of the distal colon was enhanced during the formation of soft faeces and decreased during the production of hard faeces. The results support the concept that hard faeces are chiefly produced by a separation of liquids and solids and by a retrograde transfer of liquid digesta rather than by an increased absorption of water...|$|E
40|$|A {{constitutive}} {{framework is}} {{provided for the}} characterization of the mechanical behavior of colonic tissues, as a fundamental tool {{for the development of}} numerical models of the colonic structures. The constitutive analysis is performed by a multi-disciplinary approach that requires the cooperation between experimental and computational competences. The preliminary investigation pertains to the review of the tissues histology. The complex structural configuration of the tissues and the specific distributions of fibrous elements entail the non-linear mechanical behavior and the anisotropic response. The identification of the mechanical properties requires to perform mechanical tests according to different loading situations, as different loading directions. Because of the typical functionality of colon structures, the tissues mechanics is investigated by tensile tests, which are performed on taenia coli and <b>haustra</b> specimens from fresh pig colons. Accounting for the histological investigation and the results from the mechanical tests, a specific hyperelastic framework is provided within the theory of fiber-reinforced composite materials. Preliminary analytical formulations are defined to identify the constitutive parameters by the inverse analysis of the experimental tests. Finite element models of the specimens are developed accounting for the actual configuration of the colon structures to verify the quality of the results. The good agreement between experimental and numerical model results suggests the reliability of the constitutive formulations and parameters. Finally, the developed constitutive analysis makes it possible to identify the mechanical behavior and properties of the different colonic tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} a chance to dissect an elephant. The {{following}} memoirs concerning this elephant were brought to us from the owner: Owner: AKABAYASHI Moju Circus Name: Miss MASUMI Age: 7 years old Sex: Female Species: Indian elephant (Elephas maximus L.) Weight: About 2000 kg. at healthy time Date of death: 4 o'clock p. m., 17, Jan., 1956 From 2 o'clock p. m. of the 21 st, the dissection was carried out. From the point of veterinary anatomy, several interesting records were obtained and are as follows; 1. The lung is connected firmly with the thoracic wall {{as well as with the}} diaphragm by connective tissue to large extent. Usually, these attachments of the lung to the surroundings are not observed in the common domestic animals under normal conditions. 2. The lung consists of only one left lobe and two right lobes, and one of the latter is a small intermediate lobe. 3. The left azygos vein enters the coronary sinus of the heart. 4. The arterial ramification from the aortic arch is similar to that of the swine and the dog. That is, the aortic arch sends out a brachiocephalic artery and then a left brachial artery (A subclavia sinistra). The brachiocephalic artery is short and divides into two common carotid arteries and a right brachial artery (A subclavia dextra) at the almost same point. 5. The lobation of the liver is simple at a glance. Only the fissure between the left lateral and the left medial lobe is clear, so that the liver seems to consist of two lobes. But anatomically it is divided into a large left lateral, a small left medial, a central, a right and a caudate lobe without process. 6. The liver has no typical gall-bladder, but a partially bladder-like hepatic duct. This duct opens into the duodenum at about 1 m. from the pylorus of the stomach. 7. The spleen manifests the shape like as a long tongue. 8. The small intestine is 17. 25 m., the large intestine 7. 60 m. and the caecum 0. 8 m. in length. The aspect of the intestines is similar to that of the horse. The taenia and the <b>haustra</b> of the large intestine are not so clearly defined as those of the horse. The caecum is found distinctly. 9. The kidney is divided into several distinct lobes. The fissures on the surface of the kidney are not so clear as those of the cattle. 10. The ovary has folds on its surface like as the brain. 11. The uterus consists of neck, body and two obvious horns. A clear ligament (Lig. intercornuale) is found as a septal wall in the cranial portion of the uterine body. 12. The urogenital tract extends from the ischial arch forward to the region between the thighs where it opens. Values and measurements of internal organs obtained are as follows.; Lung Weight: 17. 2 kg. Left lobe: 69 cm. in length and 32 cm. in width Right lobe: 71 cm. in length and 32 cm. in width Intermediate lobe: 20 cm. in length and 6 cm. in width Heart Weight: 8. 15 kg.
