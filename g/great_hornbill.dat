The <b>great</b> Indian <b>hornbill</b> {{is one of}} the largest hornbills and these are found from sea level up to 5000 ft. <b>Great</b> Indian <b>hornbills</b> like to eat various types of berries.

Large, tall and old trees, particularly emergents that rise above the canopy, seem to be preferred for nesting. They form monogamous pair bonds and live in small groups of 2-40 individuals. Group courtship displays involving up to 20 birds have been observed.|$|R
