5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

25|$|Timber {{has also}} {{long been a}} major industry, {{although}} in recent {{years there has been}} an uneasy balance between forestry for wood and forestry for conservation. Much of the region is public land administered by the Department of Conservation and the region has some of the best remaining stands of native forest, along with a wealth of rare wildlife. Ecotourism is now an important industry, and this goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|In mid-July, George Robinson, {{owner of}} the Wilmington Potomacs, {{announced}} that his team was folding; the league contracted to seven teams and the Potomacs players dispersed to other teams. Over {{the next few weeks}} Hilldale widened its lead, and by early September they appeared to have the championship <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Potomacs no longer playing and with many teams having missed games, teams in the league were unable to complete their 70-game schedules.

25|$|The Scramble for Africa (1881–1914), {{meaning the}} rapid occupation, {{colonisation}} and annexation of inland Africa by European powers, went hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spread of literacy amongst native Africans, as the Latin script was introduced {{where there were}} other writing systems or none. Until the early 19th century, the Berber peoples in North Africa had two systems: originally Tifinagh, and, following the spread of Islam, the Arabic script as well. French colonists, particularly missionaries and army linguists, developed a Berber Latin alphabet to make communication easier, especially for the Kabyle people in French Algeria. Since no great body of Berber literature existed, and the colonisers greatly helped improve literacy rates, the romanisation received much support, more so after Algerian independence (1962) when the French-educated Kabyle intelligentsia began to stimulate the transition and especially since {{the establishment of a}} standard transcription for Kabylie in 1970. Similar French attempts to latinise the Arabic language met much more resistance, were unsuccessful and eventually abandoned.|$|E
25|$|England {{inserted}} India on a green wicket {{and soon}} had them reeling at 145/7 {{in the second}} session of the match. However, a century by Ajinkya Rahane and a good knock by Bhuvneshwar Kumar led India to 295. England rode on Gary Ballance's second Test century to take a narrow lead. Fifties from Murali Vijay, Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in India's second innings meant England required 319 to win the Test. England captain Cook's poor form continued and England ended day 4 needing 209 runs with six wickets <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> last ball before lunch on the final day, Ishant Sharma got Moeen Ali out to a bouncer; India continued to pepper England with relentless short-pitched bowling, and {{within an hour of}} play restarting, England were all out. After the match, England wicket-keeper Matt Prior announced that he would step down {{for the rest of the}} summer due to injury. This was India's first overseas Test win for three years.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th {{century the}} best work is {{undoubtedly}} to {{be found on the}} Continent. France, Germany and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered American continent was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. Pilasters took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of design. House fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in Bishopsgate, but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, {{is a good example of}} decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, Bristol. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that Jacobean form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which is at once as decorative as it is simple.|$|E

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> song's composition.|$|E
500|$|Dmowski often communicated {{his belief}} in a [...] "international Jewish conspiracy" [...] aimed against Poland. In his essay [...] "Żydzi wobec wojny" [...] (Jews on the War) written about World War I, Dmowski claimed that Zionism was only a cloak to {{disguise}} the Jewish ambition to rule the world. Dmowski asserted that once a Jewish state was established in Palestine, this {{would serve as a}} nucleus for the Jewish take-over of the world. In the same essay, Dmowski accused the Jews of being Poland's most dangerous enemy and of working hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Germans to dismember Poland again. Dmowski believed that the 3,000,000 Polish Jews were far too numerous to be absorbed, and assimilated into the Polish Catholic culture.|$|E

500|$|A {{sense of}} foreboding and {{paranoia}} pervades {{the world of}} the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored—especially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to [...] "off-world" [...] (extraterrestrial) colonies. The dystopian themes explored in Blade Runner are an early example of the expansion of cyberpunk concepts into cinema. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.|$|E
500|$|In late 2006, both Upton and Brownback tabled {{bills to}} place {{governmental}} oversight on {{aspects of the}} ESRB rating process, and make it illegal for publishers to misrepresent the playable content of a video game to a ratings board; Upton proposed a bill known as the [...] Video Game Decency Act, explaining that developers had [...] "done an end-run around the process to deliver violent and pornographic material to our kids", and that the bill would [...] " [...] hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mission of the industry’s own ratings system." [...] Brownback proposed a bill known as the Truth in Video Game Rating Act, which would have also forced the ESRB to have full, hands-on access to games instead of just video footage, and have initiated a government study on the [...] "effectiveness" [...] of the organization {{and the possibility of}} forming a ratings organization independent from the video game industry.|$|E
500|$|In June 1940, with World War II already {{raging in}} Europe, Vannevar Bush, the {{director}} of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, recruited Conant to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), although he remained president of Harvard. Bush envisaged the NDRC as bringing scientists together to [...] ""conduct research for the creation and improvement of instrumentalities, methods and materials of warfare." [...] Although the United States had not yet entered the war, Conant was not alone in his conviction that Nazi Germany had to be stopped, and that the United States would inevitably become embroiled in the conflict. The immediate task, as Conant saw it, was therefore to organize American science for war. He became head of the NDRC's Division B, the division responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals. On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director. Conant succeeded Bush as Chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. Roger Adams, a contemporary of Conant's at Harvard in the 1910s, succeeded him as head of Division B. Conant became the driving force of the NDRC on personnel and policy matters. The NDRC would work hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Army and Navy's research efforts, supplementing rather than supplanting them. It was specifically charged with investigating nuclear fission.|$|E
