25|$|Historian Harvey Klehr {{indicates}} that {{membership of the}} WAA did exhibit growth after unification, however, in large measure {{as a result of}} growth of the WPA <b>jobs</b> <b>program</b> and the ability of now employed WPA workers to pay the relatively nominal dues of the WAA. Despite misgivings about painting itself into a corner as a de facto trade union for WPA employees, it seems that in practice the WAA became exactly that, with WPA employees constituting some 75 percent of the organization's dues paying membership by 1939. The survival of the WAA was thus intimately linked with the fate of the WPA program, with periodic layoffs of WPA workers due to budgetary constraints playing havoc with the WAA's membership rolls.|$|E

He quickly moved up the leadership ranks in the 1970s, becoming House Majority Whip in 1971, House Majority Leader in 1973, and Speaker of the House in 1977. With the election of President Jimmy Carter, O'Neill hoped to establish a universal health care system and a <b>jobs</b> <b>program.</b> However, relations between Carter and Congress collapsed and Democrats lost control of the presidency in the 1980 presidential election. O'Neill became a leading opponent of Republican President Ronald Reagan's conservative domestic policies. O'Neill and Reagan found more common ground in foreign policy, fostering the Anglo-Irish Agreement and implementing the Reagan Doctrine in the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E

By 1935, the [...] "Second New Deal" [...] added Social Security (which was later considerably extended through the Fair Deal), a <b>jobs</b> <b>program</b> for the unemployed (the Works Progress Administration, WPA) and, through the National Labor Relations Board, a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the GDP. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%.

2500|$|Epton's {{campaign}} referred to, {{among other}} things, Washington's conviction {{for failure to}} file income tax returns (he had paid the taxes, but had not filed a return). Washington, on the other hand, stressed reforming the Chicago patronage system {{and the need for}} a <b>jobs</b> <b>program</b> in a tight economy. In the April 12, 1983, mayoral general election, Washington defeated Epton by 3.7%, 51.7% to 48.0%, to become mayor of Chicago. Washington was sworn in as mayor on April 29, 1983, and resigned his Congressional seat the following day. During his tenure as mayor, Washington lived at the Hampton House apartments in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. He created the city's first environmental-affairs department under the management of longtime Great Lakes environmentalist Lee Botts. Washington's first term in office was characterized by conflict with the city council dubbed [...] "Council Wars", referring to the then-recent Star Wars films and caused Chicago to be nicknamed [...] "Beirut on the Lake". A 29-alderman City Council majority refused to enact Washington's legislation and prevented him from appointing nominees to boards and commissions.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} basic {{information}} for policy alternatives of senior <b>job</b> <b>programs</b> through {{the review of}} social insurance policy issues and application projects of similar policies for other countries. The main {{results of this study}} show that the working time of the elderly under the senior <b>job</b> <b>program</b> is less than 60 hours per month and 60. 4 % participate in the program for their livelihood. However, even though their demands for the cost of living are very high, these facts are not for all senior <b>job</b> <b>program</b> participants. Also, 200, 000 Korean Won per month cannot be regarded as an adequate wage for living expenses. At this point, we are uncertain if the participants are subject to social insurance tax. However, if the participants are still considered as workers in the labor market, it is desirable for senior <b>job</b> <b>programs</b> to be excluded from the application of the labor laws including the expansion of worker’s compensation’s coverage for public interest activists. 본 논문은 최근 논란이 되고 있는 노인일자리사업의 사회보험 적용과제를 검토하여 노인일자리사업의 현안 해결에 필요한 기초자료를 제공하고자 시도되었다. 연구결과 첫째, 노인일자리사업 참여노인은 대부분 월 60 시간 미만의 초단시간근로자이지만 생계비마련을 위해 참여하는 비율이 높아서 사회보험의 적용대상기준인지 논란이 되고 있다. 그러나 생계비 마련의 욕구가 높아도 60. 4 %이기 때문에 전체 노인으로 일반화하기 어렵고, 월 20 만원의 일자리를 생업으로 보기 어렵다. 사회보험 특히 고용보험의 생업에 대한 명확한 기준마련과 노인일자리사업에 대한 가치정립이 필요하다. 그럼에도 노인일자리사업의 참여노인을 근로자로 본다면, 노인일자리사업을 노동관계법에서 적용제외하는 것이 적절할 것으로 판단된다. 다만, 사회보장법 특히, 산재보험은 독립개념설을 적용하거나 사회법적 성격을 강화하여 근로자가 아닌 공익활동자(노인일자리사업 포함) 에게도 확대할 필요가 있다...|$|R
