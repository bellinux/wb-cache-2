5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
25|$|The {{boy with}} the squint was a patient of the doctor's, which is most likely how he became infected. He is brought to the {{quarantine}} without his mother and soon falls in with the group in the first ward.

25|$|Locke's {{ideology}} and leadership even had impact in Europe. In France, people {{were looking at}} <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> figure that brought the black population together in the racist era that America was facing at the time. They compared that movement to how the Jewish population in Europe was staying tight together, especially after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Kōsei's {{childhood}} friend and next-door neighbor, who treats <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little brother. She is athletic and {{is part of}} the softball club at school. Often dismayed at Kōsei's inability to move on from his mother's death, she attempts to get him to play the piano again {{in order to make a}} clear decision about his future. She first denies her feelings for him but after undergoing several stages of denial, she falls in love with him, which she confesses to him later on.|$|E
25|$|When chaos {{broke out}} {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Lai Min and his elder sister fled south to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to evade trouble. Lai Min's elder sister married Huang Wan (黃琬), a nephew of the {{grandmother}} of Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). When Liu Zhang heard that they were in Jing Province, he sent people to fetch them to Yi Province. Lai Min followed his sister and brother-in-law to Yi Province, where Liu Zhang treated <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> guest.|$|E

During his night with them he dreams that the wild king Lycurgus attacks <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lion attacks a deer. The next morning Staphylus gives Dionysus splendid presents and encourages him to fight. While Dionysus is busy filling Assyria with his vine, Staphylus suddenly dies and his palace is filled with mourning voices. Dionysus returns to the palace only to find his friend dead.|$|E
25|$|The case of Sanju Bhagat, {{also known}} as Sanjay Kumar, a man from Nagpur, India, {{attracted}} attention in 1999 {{for the length of}} time (36 years) he had carried his parasitic twin inside his body, {{and the size of the}} growth. Since Bhagat had no placenta, the growth had connected directly to his blood supply. In an extremely unusual case, a 2-year-old boy became pregnant with his parasitic twin inside his stomach feeding off <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal fetus would feed on its mother. The boy required a Caesarean section. It is virtually impossible that the fetus could survive this process due to being underdeveloped.|$|E
25|$|The SCG {{has been}} both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst {{incidents}} to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped {{on the bottom of}} a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.|$|E

Did you make Malcolm? Did you clean up Malcolm? Did you put Malcolm out before the world? Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation. And a nation gotta {{be able to deal with}} traitors and cutthroats and turncoats. The white man deals with his. The Jews deal with theirs.|$|E
25|$|The Man with Red Eyes is a being whom Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin {{encounter}} {{on their}} quest to rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's father on the planet Camazotz. He is the Prime Coordinator on Camazotz. Although he appears human, he explains that IT actually talks through <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> robot or demented puppet, {{that he is a}} part of IT. He entices Charles Wallace to look into his glowing red eyes in order to find his father. When Charles Wallace does so, he too becomes possessed by the mind of IT, after which the Man with Red Eyes drops out of the story. Then, the man with red eyes tries to capture Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace. IT talks through him. He has the ability to communicate telepathically.|$|E
25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece of paper on which the poet had sketched out a piece titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), pressed him to hand in his weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E

25|$|When Harry {{arrives at}} the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's {{experimentation}} with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that something might have happened to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, {{for the first time}} in his life, he has someone to be there for <b>him,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mother.|$|E
25|$|When {{the famous}} monk Kumārajīva was {{captured}} during the Chinese {{conquest of the}} Buddhist kingdom of Kucha, he was imprisoned for many years. When he was released in AD 401, he immediately took a high place in Chinese Buddhism and was appraised as a great master from the West. He was especially valued by Emperor Yao Xing {{of the state of}} Later Qin, who gave him an honorific title and treated <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> god. Kumārajīva revolutionized Chinese Buddhism with his high quality translations (from AD 402-413), which are still praised for their flowing smoothness, clarity of meaning, subtlety, and literary skill. Due to the efforts of Kumārajīva, Buddhism in China became not only recognized for its practice methods, but also as high philosophy and religion. The arrival of Kumārajīva also set a standard for Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, effectively doing away with previous concept-matching systems.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Craig {{started to}} date Alice Piper (Toni Potter) {{and tried to}} stop Sarah marrying TK, but ended up escorting Sarah to the {{ceremony}} himself. Craig suffered a huge heart attack at the wedding party and was infuriated by Alice treating <b>him</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> patient. In 2008, Craig was devastated when he nearly lost Alice to The Ferndale Strangler and helped her through her post-traumatic stress before he proposed. Alice became pregnant but Craig broke it off when he realised she had cheated on him. He was devastated to learn how badly bullied his daughter Scarlett (Nicole Thomson) was and left Shortland Street for a position at pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, where he hoped he could expose their illegal activities. However, shortly after discovering sufficient evidence, Craig was run off the road, beaten and set alight by hired thugs. A memorial service was held days later, where Sarah sang a song highlighting Craig's personality. With Craig's evidence, Scott Spear was shut down in 2009.|$|E
