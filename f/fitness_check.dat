This analysis, mostly of a quantitative nature, was accompanied where possible and relevant by a qualitative assessment in accordance with the Commission's general approach to fitness checks. In particular, the report analysed how coherently and consistently the EU legislation, identified as relevant for the sector, works together, whether it is effective and efficient, and whether it is associated with excessive regulatory burdens, overlaps, gaps, inconsistencies or obsolete measures. Since this <b>fitness</b> <b>check</b> addressed a specific industry sector rather than a policy area, it had a specific focus on the cumulative impact, effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the measures with respect to the oil refining sector.

Analysis {{of factors}} shaping the market {{environment}} the oil {{sector in the}} European Union leads {{to the conclusion that}} the main elements having an impact on the profitability of refinery operations include their complexity index, access to a particular slate of crude oil, supply infrastructure (land premium, supply side, etc.) as well as laws and regulations regarding this very industry (both EU and national legislation). It should be emphasized that on the one hand European refiners compete against each other on national markets (including the EU market), on the other hand, however, they are vulnerable to competitive activity of refineries from outside of the European Union. Recent years clearly outline the downturn in the oil refining sector of the EU, that is manifested by idling the refineries, changes in their base model activity (conversion into the fuel and crude oil storage sites), or at best sector acquisitions by foreign companies (mainly from the Russian Federation). The progressive loss of capacity of oil refining on the Old Continent will cause significant changes in the energy security of fuel supplies, which simply, will have to be imported from abroad in the foreseeable future. In order to counteract the negative developments in the market, refineries affiliated with professional organizations (such as EUROPIA, Concawe) have taken an action in co-operation with the European Commission and the International Energy Agency aimed to develop the so-called pilot - horizontal control of refining sector efficiency (<b>fitness</b> <b>check)</b> involving the review of existing EU law.

However, understanding ecosystem services (ESS) {{in terms of}} spatial distribution and trade-offs still remains a challenge for landscape planners and natural resource managers. In this paper, we analyzed the supply {{of a set of}} ESS – carbon storage, soil erosion protection, biodiversity, and recreation – within the landscape surrounding the city of Bari in Southern Italy. Through an analysis of this landscape, which includes natural protected areas, such as Natura 2000 Network sites, national and regional parks and nature reserves, and in view of the recent <b>Fitness</b> <b>Check</b> of the Nature Directives, we aimed to provide answers to the following questions: (i) Where are the areas of high and low supply of individual ecosystem services located?; (ii) Where do ecosystem service trade-offs (i. e., ‘hotspots’ and ‘coldspots’) occur?; and (iii) To what extent are ecosystem service hotspots and coldspots located within or outside of natural protected areas? Results show that most of the landscape in the study area supplied {{at least one of the}} selected ESS and that ESS hotspots were mostly located within forested and/or natural areas. Hotspots occupied 8. 0 % of the total landscape, with 23. 7 % located in natural protected areas. Coldspots were scarce and equal to 2. 4 %; they constituted only 0. 1 % of natural protected areas. Almost all of the landscape (89. 6 %) consists of intermediate areas (i. e., between hotspots and coldspots); 76. 2 % of natural protected areas consists of intermediate areas. This latter finding is relevant because the high intermediate classes are potentially high-performing areas, which lie mainly on the borders of protected spaces; they can positively influence ecological processes and thus enhance a wide-ranging provision of ESS.

Rewilding is a logical next step in an on-going process of EU nature policy development and the ‘Policy Brief’ identifies areas where rewilding principles can extend and reinvigorate European nature policy. Rewilding is a powerful new term in conservation. This may be because it combines a sense of passion and feeling for nature with advances in ecological science. The term resonates with diverse publics and {{seems to have a}} particular feel to a younger urban generation and among those who want a voice in shaping a new rural environment. It has attained a significant scientific, practical and media presence during the last few years. In late 2 o 15 and 2016, the authors of the ‘Policy Brief’ conducted interviews with experts in EU nature policy and legislation, in rewilding science and practice to explore opportunities to create a policy environment that would support fuller expression of emerging rewilding visions and examples. The result is a paper that describes rewilding and its key principles in the perspective of current and possible future relationships with EU politics, the Nature Directives, wilderness and ecosystem restoration. It also identifies existing and new policy frames and how rewilding can contribute to these, such as the Water Framework Directive, and a Trans-European Green Network (TEN-G). The Policy Brief presents the latest thinking on how rewilding is unfolding in a European context, and how it can contribute to the 15 % restoration target that the EU committed to in the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy.

40|$|Abstract—The growing {{complexity}} of processes in many organizations stimulates {{the adoption of}} business process analysis techniques. Typically, such techniques are based on process models and assume that the operational processes in reality conform to these models. However, experience shows that reality often deviates from hand-made models. Therefore, the problem of checking {{to what extent the}} operational process conforms to the process model is important for process management, process improvement, and compliance. In this paper, we present a robust replay analysis technique that is able to measure the conformance of an event log for a given process model. The approach quantifies conformance and provides intuitive diagnostics (skipped and inserted activities). Our technique has been implemented in the ProM 6 framework. Comparative evaluations show that the approach overcomes many of the limitations of existing conformance checking techniques.

The survey consisted of four parts; (i) general information about ergonomics problems with regard to working conditions and environments of female workers which were obtained through preliminary research studies; (ii) preliminary survey of ergonomics problems regarding health and safety of female workers in different industries in Thailand; (iii) selection of two different industries of Thailand to carry out more detailed studies of physical and psycho-social problems, particularly related to musculoskeletal disorders; and (iv) examination of the ergonomics intervention practices at work places by case-study in Japan and Thailand. Methods used in these studies were; (i) ergonomics checklist; (ii) working environmental measurements; (iii) questionnaire study for subjective feeling of fatigue; (iv) grip strength and back and leg strength tests; (v) hearing test; (vi) questionnaire study for the assessment of musculoskeletal disorders {{in various parts of the}} body; (vii) psycho-social questionnaire study for analysis of stress at work as well as in daily life situation; (viii) anthropometric measurements of the standing and sitting positions; (ix) work posture analysis, using OWAS method; (x) job analysis, using AET method; (xi) simple clinical and physical <b>fitness</b> tests for <b>checking</b> musculoskeletal disorders; and (xii) using three different questionnaires, i. e., interviewing management, employees and governmental officers for examining ergonomics intervention practices at work places. The results showed that the female workers in different industries of the two countries had experienced musculo-skeletal discomforts in various parts of their body and work stress. The reasons for the high prevalence of such problems seem to be multifactorial and complicated. For instance, the female workers have prolonged standing or sitting postures during work, operating machines which are not appropriately designed, and doing heavy manual material handling. They adopt awkward work postures which usually lead to musculoskeletal disorders. The association between work postures and symptoms problems is a factor of exposure time. It becomes obvious that ergonomics problems related to occupational health and safety of the female workers in this survey seem to have cause-effect responses which could be classified into three main categories; (i) poor working practices and workplace programmes without sufficient knowledge of ergonomics principles; (ii) lack of adjustment to local population of imported machinery and equipment and their use; and (iii) lack of appropriate work organization. The tri-partites (management, employees and governmental officers) of the two countries had the same opinion about the importance of the ergonomics intervention programme. They desired co-operation and more participation approach to achieve better success in their intervention programmes. However, they had some shortcomings in their intervention programmes; such as lack of co-operation among industrial staff, lack of budget and human resources, differences in attitudes or awareness between the management and the employees with regard to occupational health and safety, lack of managerial support, lack of technical knowledge and unclarity of government policy. Based on the results, a practical method of ergonomics intervention at work is developed for improvement of working conditions of female workers which combines the following two characteristics: (a) participatory ergonomics training in order to develop awareness and understanding of practical ergonomics principles, and (b) industry-level promotional activities to facilitate voluntary participation and co-operation between managers, workers and government officers. In addition, further research activity is continuously needed for ergonomics implementation, particularly in the industrially developing countries. Godkänd; 1992; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R
