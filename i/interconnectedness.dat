5|$|Most of the Daddies' studio albums {{are written}} to varying extents as concept albums, {{featuring}} either recurring lyrical themes or an abstract progressive narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical <b>interconnectedness</b> is intended as means of providing an album with threads of thematic stability against wildly varying musical styles.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} <b>interconnectedness</b> {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first {{movement}} and the minuet and trio. The movement is the most economical of all: the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude in exactly the same way.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the primary}} morals of Barbauld's lessons is that {{individuals}} {{are part of a}} community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that emphasised the <b>interconnectedness</b> of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.|$|E
25|$|Ecology had now gained general {{acceptance}} {{as a scientific}} discipline, and many concepts vital to sustainability were being explored. These included: the <b>interconnectedness</b> of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the biosphere; the importance of natural cycles (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through trophic levels of living systems.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>interconnectedness</b> between {{peoples and}} geo-cultural domains is {{becoming}} increasingly common, Al-Rodhan maintains that the fate of one geo-cultural domain will affect the fate of others. Justice is central to human dignity, individual geo-cultural triumph, and the overall well-being of human civilization. Thus, according to Al-Rodhan, meeting the minimum criteria of global justice is a prerequisite to the triumph of human civilization.|$|E
25|$|Joan Severn, {{together}} with Ruskin’s secretary, W. G. Collingwood, and his eminent American friend, Charles Eliot Norton, were executors to his Will. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume Library Edition of Ruskin's Works, the last volume of which, an index, attempts {{to articulate the}} complex <b>interconnectedness</b> of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.|$|E
25|$|The first life {{arose from}} abiotic {{chemical}} reactions. When this happened, how it happened, and even what planet {{it happened on}} are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless chemistry and physics. It is constrained by principles such as thermodynamics. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the <b>interconnectedness,</b> if not sameness, of life and Earth.|$|E
25|$|At that time, {{there was}} already strong social {{differentiation}} indicated by rich mound burials. There are parallels to the Early Kurgan culture. Cremation was practised. Painted pottery was introduced. Tin-based bronze became predominant. Geographical <b>interconnectedness</b> and links with {{other areas of the}} Near East are seen in many aspects of the culture. For example, a cauldron found in Trialeti is nearly identical to the one from Shaft Grave 4 of Mycenae in Greece.|$|E
25|$|UNCG {{established}} sustainability {{as one of}} {{its five}} Core Values through the 2009 Strategic Plan. In this document, the University defined sustainability as: Academics, operations, and outreach… conducted with careful attention to the enduring <b>interconnectedness</b> of social equity, the environment, the economy, and aesthetics. This action {{led to the creation of}} the Office of Sustainability with the hiring of the university’s first full-time Sustainability Coordinator in April 2010, as well as the formation of the UNCG Sustainability Council in September 2010.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have begun}} to analyze the agency of women in {{overseas}} missions. At first, missionary societies officially enrolled only men, but women increasingly insisted on playing a variety of roles. Single women typically worked as educators. Wives assisted their missionary husbands in most of his roles. Advocates stopped short of calling {{for the end of}} specified gender roles, but they stressed the <b>interconnectedness</b> of the public and private spheres and spoke out against perceptions of women as weak and house-bound.|$|E
25|$|Geobiology employs {{molecular}} biology, environmental microbiology, chemical analyses, and the geologic {{record to}} investigate the evolutionary <b>interconnectedness</b> of life and Earth. It attempts {{to understand how the}} Earth has changed since the origin of life and what it might have been like along the way. Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the origin of life and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the Anthropocene.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the <b>interconnectedness</b> and shrinking {{of time and space}} in the modern world of telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|While {{the onset}} of the Cold War helped spur <b>interconnectedness</b> between Canada and Latin America the erosion of Soviet power in the late 1980s gave way to an even more robust partnership. By 1985 the Soviet empire was {{becoming}} increasingly bankrupt and unable to promote socialist ideology abroad. For many leftist Latin American states this generated a significant void in support for their vast nationalist/leftist movements. Thus, from the altering world balance came the proliferation of peace talks, the emergence of new economic regimes, and increasingly intertwined relations between the Northern and the Southern Western hemisphere. Canada’s policies towards the region revolved around this new economic order that saw the distribution of power slipping from a bipolar system to multiple states, organizations, and corporations.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values {{around the world in}} such a way as to extend and intensify social relations. This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing <b>interconnectedness</b> among different populations and cultures.|$|E
25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and <b>interconnectedness,</b> where individuals are encouraged to develop a sense of self that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have memories that cast the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have memories that express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E
25|$|Learners {{develop their}} {{understanding}} of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the <b>interconnectedness</b> of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), media literacy and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue {{is the way in which}} language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the <b>interconnectedness</b> of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their <b>interconnectedness</b> with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|... "Timewave zero" [...] is a numerological {{formula that}} purports to {{calculate}} {{the ebb and flow}} of [...] "novelty", defined as increase over time in the universe's <b>interconnectedness,</b> or organized complexity. Terence McKenna claimed that the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases <b>interconnectedness.</b> He believed this which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience.|$|E

500|$|Although New Age {{activists have}} been {{motivated}} by New Age concepts like holism, <b>interconnectedness,</b> monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse, ranging from far-right and conservative through to liberal, socialist, and libertarian. Accordingly, Kyle stated that [...] "New Age politics {{is difficult to}} describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark." [...] MacKian suggested that the New Age operated {{as a form of}} [...] "world-realigning infrapolitics" [...] that undermines the disenchantment of modern Western society.|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophical}} {{premises of}} Yajnavalkya and Patanjali are different, according to Richard Rosen. Patanjali accepts the dualism premise, and defines yoga as cessation of mental activity associated with sensory interaction with nature, leading to Kaivalya (aloneness) {{of the self}} and a state of self-awareness. Yajnavalkya accepts the Advaita Vedanta premise of non-dualism, [...] "essential oneness of self and nature", and defines yoga as path to intense <b>interconnectedness</b> between Jiva and Paramatman, where the union of self and supreme self is realized.|$|E

He goes on to claim this nucleus of 60 families is supported by a larger group of 440 families of secondary prestige.

These include the Shiva Sutras, the Shiva Samhita, and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism {{such as the}} 10th-century scholar Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that [...] "people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand <b>interconnectedness,</b> and thus benefit both {{the individual and the}} world towards a more blissful state of existence.|$|E
500|$|The minuet is the {{shortest}} among those of the Opus 50, but the trio features an exceptionally long second section, which uses drifting melodies, a fermata {{and a pair of}} two-measure pauses {{to create a sense of}} timelessness. Neither the minuet nor the trio reaches a proper conclusion, and in this they continue a feature of the first two movements. [...] The minuet ends with a perfunctory reprise of its main theme and the trio draws out its final cadence with a chromatic passage marked [...] "diminuendo". [...] Again, Haydn reinforces the <b>interconnectedness</b> between the movements with an explicit direction to the performers for an immediate segue from the reprised minuet to the finale.|$|E
500|$|Arshagouni, on {{the other}} hand, {{describes}} the Devotions as Donne's most mature, perhaps most complex work: a remarkable, sustained prose-poem that not only expresses conflicting and powerful internal emotions but also consciously provides its readers with a touching model of the experiences of God's elect in confronting the inexorable course of human sinfulness that characterizes life on earth. Helen Wilcox writes that [...] "the mixture of elaborate rhetoric, painstaking argument, and the frank details of his melancholic 'ridling distemper' creates a particularly powerful impact" [...] and draws particular attention to Meditation XVII, noting that despite the apparent self-interest of the Devotions, that piece highlights Donne's recognition of the ultimate <b>interconnectedness</b> of humanity. Meditation XVII was also the focus of Robert Jungman, who, writing in American Notes and Queries, noted it as the most forceful statement of Donne's theme in what was ultimately a [...] "powerful psychological analysis".|$|E
500|$|Language and {{linguistic}} barriers {{are a major}} theme in The Word for World Is Forest, something exemplified by the title. In contrast to other Hainish universe novels such as The Left Hand of Darkness, The Word for World Is Forest portrays a communication gap that the protagonists are never able to bridge. Both the native Athsheans and the loggers have languages that reflect their perceptions of reality, but {{they are unable to}} find a common language. In the native Athshean language, the word [...] "Athshe" [...] means both [...] "forest" [...] and [...] "world", demonstrating the close link that the Athsheans have to the forest and their planet. It is noted by Lyubov that the Athsheans believe [...] "the substance of their world was not earth, but forest". The language used by the Athsheans during conversations similarly show their <b>interconnectedness</b> and dependence on their ecosystem through the use of forest related metaphors.|$|E
500|$|Volk {{points out}} that the poem borrows or alludes to a number of {{philosophical}} traditions, including Hermeticism, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism, but the prevailing belief of commentators is that Manilius espouses a Stoic worldview in the Astronomica. A comparison between Manilius's beliefs and those of other Stoics reveals parallels that, according to Volk, [...] "are immediately obvious". For instance, Stoics and Manilius agree on the divinity of the universe, the argument from design, the assumption that the supreme god is both the creator of as well as the active force within the universe, the <b>interconnectedness</b> of everything, the understanding that humans are intimately connected to the cosmos, the importance of considering the heavens, and the belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all. The agreement on this latter point is of special importance, as, according to Volk, belief in fate is [...] "one of the most notorious aspects of the Stoic system".|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Millgate, {{though it}} is not {{typically}} considered Faulkner's best novel, Light in August was recognized early on as being [...] "a major text, central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole." [...] He argues that many of the early American critics, most of whom were urban Northerners who viewed the South as backward and reactionary, focused on Faulkner's technical innovation in the field of narrative but missed or ignored the regional details and <b>interconnectedness</b> of the characters and setting to other works by the author. Some reviewers saw Faulkner's narrative techniques not as innovations but as errors, offering Faulkner recommendations on how to improve his style and admonishing him for his European modernist [...] "'tricks'". Critics were also displeased with the violence depicted in the novel, pejoratively labeling it [...] "gothic fantasy," [...] despite the fact that lynching was a reality in the South. In spite of these complaints, the novel came to be viewed positively because of its violence and dark themes, as this was a contrast to the sentimental, romantic Southern literature of the time.|$|E
500|$|Sages like Asvala, {{the priest}} in Janaka's court, Artabhaga, Bhujyu, Ushasta, and Uddalaka debated {{with him and}} asked {{questions}} philosophical subjects to which Yajnavalkya provided convincing replies and they lost the debate. It was then the turn of Gargi {{to take up the}} challenge. Gargi, as one of the disputants in the debate, questioned Yajnavalkya on his claim of superiority among the scholars. She held repeated arguments with him. Gargi and Yajnavalkya's exchange centered on the ultimate [...] "warp" [...] of reality ("warp" [...] means [...] "the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity). Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical, such as unending status of the soul, away from practical situations. She then changed her approach and asked him pointed questions related to the environment existing in the world, the question of the very origin of all existence. Her question was specific when she asked him [...] "since this whole world is woven back and forth on water, on what then is woven back and forth", a question that related to the commonly known cosmological metaphor that expressed the unity of the world, its essential <b>interconnectedness.</b> In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3.6), the sequence of her posing a bevy of questions to Yajnavalkya and his replies is narrated as: ...|$|E

[...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the <b>interconnectedness,</b> but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Advaita Vedanta {{has gained}} {{attention}} in western spirituality and New Age, where various traditions {{are seen as}} driven by the same non-dual experience.
