The pump is in unspared hydrodewaxer (HDW) feed service. The original seal design included nonpressurized dual seals {{to provide an}} additional level of reliability.

40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as impeller wearing rings, inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} balance drums in centrifugal pumps, or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating oils, and clearances are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by <b>internal</b> <b>clearances</b> of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the clearance space into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the clearance space itself become dominant. Both types of clearance space alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the <b>internal</b> <b>clearances</b> both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|R

Conventional techniques to clear these obstructions, including chest tube milking and stripping, have not been shown to be effective. They also significantly increase negative intrathoracic pressures that can harm internal structures and potentially impair post-operative recovery.

40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the crowned rollers.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of rolling}} element bearings is of major {{importance to the}} vast majority of rotating machines. Due to the varying assembly compliance and the <b>internal</b> <b>clearance</b> existing in the bearing in most cases, a highly non-linear behaviour of the rotor bearing system appears. Thus, a dynamic model of a horizontal rotor supported on ball bearings with radial <b>internal</b> <b>clearance</b> is considered, taking into account contact forces between the balls and the races, as well as the effect of varying compliance and of the internal radial clearance. However, since rotational speed fluctuations of various levels practically appear in all rotating equipment, their effect is now additionally considered. Their effect is examined in two characteristic rotor bearing cases. The analysis includes all the characteristic states of the dynamic behaviour of the rotor, such as periodic, unstable periodic and chaotic responses, using methods like frequency spectra, phase spaces, higher-order Poincare maps and Lyapunov exponents. All results presented show a dominant stabilization effect of the speed fluctuations with respect to the system behaviour. From the analysis performed, it is concluded that even a minimum fluctuation of the rotor speed may result in major changes of the system dynamics, indicating that speed fluctuations of the rotor are a governing parameter for the dynamic behaviour of the system.

40|$|The {{research}} concerns {{improvement of}} the power efficiency of lubricated components in automotive drivelines such as transmissions and axles. Meshed gear pairs, rolling bearings, seals and oil churning by rotating components immersed in the oil are studied. The purpose of the research is to explore {{the most effective way}} of improving the efficiency in drivelines, focusing on an axle comprising hypoid gears and a differential assembly. First, a study of the nature of losses affecting the efficiency of a simple spur gear box was carried out, and a model of friction and churning in a simple transmission was developed. Next, a detailed experimental study of oil churning losses in a hypoid axle from a four wheel drive road vehicle was carried out using the inertia run-down technique. To perform the above experiments, a new test rig for measuring oil churning losses was designed, manufactured and commissioned. The test rig allowed a wide range of speed and lubricant parameters to be explored and was designed by the author for tests available at different roll and pitch attitudes. In addition, an "extended" housing, consisting of a modified gear case that accepted the same internal components as the production axle but which had much greater <b>internal</b> <b>clearances,</b> was designed and manufactured. This enabled the effects of different casing geometry and of internal baffles to be studied. Additionally, the extension housing was modified to investigate the oil flow inside the housing through its one transparent side for the understanding of the effect of oil flow on churning losses. An investigation of design-related parameters influencing churning losses was carried out using the new test rig. Empirical equations for the churning losses, based on dimensional analysis, were developed to describe the test results. It was found that some combinations of baffles gave a significant reduction in losses. Supplementary tests were carried out using transparent windows to visualise the oil flow. These identified some of the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in churning loss and suggested a number of practical methods by which churning could be reduced without compromising the lubricant supply to remote components. It is argued that these innovations can contribute to improving fuel efficiency and limiting oil temperature rise in all-wheel-drive vehicles.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{cementing}} technique in hip resurfacing has been poorly studied to date. The hip resurfacing prosthesis is unique in the family of cemented prostheses because the cement mantle is blind (hidden underneath the implant) and is radiographically obscured. This presents an immediate challenge to the surgeon {{at the time of}} surgery, but also has a longer-term implication in terms of lack of post-operative clinical observation. This should be compared with total hip replacement or total knee replacement where the cement mantle can at least be partially observed both intra- and post-operatively. With this in mind, the objective of this review is, firstly, to understand the cement mantles typically achieved in current clinical practice and, secondly, to identify those factors affecting the cement mantle and to consolidate them into an improved and reproducible cementing technique. The outcome of this work shows that the low-viscosity technique can commonly lead to excessive cement penetration in the proximal femoral head and an incompletely seated component, whereas a more consistent controlled cement mantle can be achieved with a high-viscosity cementing technique. Consequently, it is recommended that a high-viscosity technique should be used to minimize the build-up of excessive cement, to reduce the temperature created by the exothermic polymerization, and to help to ensure correct seating of the prosthesis. A combination of these factors is potentially critical to the clinical success of some articular surface replacement (ASR) procedures. It {{is important to note that}} we specifically studied the DePuy ASR system; therefore only the general principles (and not the specifics) of the cementing technique may apply to other resurfacing prostheses, because of differences in <b>internal</b> geometry, <b>clearance,</b> and surgical technique...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the cause of}} unstable vibrations that sporadically occur in decanting centrifuges as being caused {{by a combination of}} <b>internal</b> bearing <b>clearance,</b> conveyor unbalance and low bearing loads. These centrifuges are different from other rotating equipment common in industry (pumps, fans, compressors, electric motors) in that they are dual rotor systems – one rotor inside the other. Unbalance in either rotor can produce severe vibration of the whole machine when the running speed is close to a mode of vibration – that is, running at or near a critical speed. The external rotor, called the bowl, is subjected to an internal pressure generated by the centrifugal force of the product being separated. The internal rotor is supported from the bowl and {{is in the form of}} an auger screw. The main supporting bearings are subjected to forces from both the bowl and the auger - the liquid end bearing also supports the gearbox. Being able to predict critical speeds through numerical or computational analysis is a necessary step in the design process or for troubleshooting vibration problems. As part of the study, the main rolling element bearings were replaced by oil-film journal bearings to assess the viability of their use. Journal bearings are simpler, of lower cost and generate less noise than their rolling element counterparts. However, instability in running above the first critical speed can result due to oil film forces and internal hysteresis of the rotor assembly. The auger is asymmetric so instability in running is possible at around half the first critical speed. This study was undertaken to understand the dynamics of decanting type centrifuges and develop a methodology for identifying their critical speeds and cause of unstable vibration. In the longer term this will assist in the generation of new designs that are quieter, use less energy and have better separation efficiencies...|$|R
