5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia,</b> jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Prehepatic: Increased {{bilirubin}} production can {{be due to}} {{a number}} of causes, including <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> and internal hemorrhage.|$|R
50|$|Anemias of {{increased}} {{red blood cell}} destruction are generally classified as <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias.</b> These are generally featuring jaundice and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels.|$|R
50|$|A {{deficiency}} of GPI {{is responsible for}} 4% of the <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> due to glycolytic enzyme deficiencies. Several cases of GPI deficiency have recently been identified.|$|R
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia,</b> psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b> Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
50|$|Normochromic {{is a form}} of anemia {{in which}} the {{concentration}} of hemoglobin in the red blood cells is within the standard range. However, there are insufficient numbers of red blood cells. This includes: aplastic, posthemorrhagic, and <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> and anemia of chronic disease.MCH or MCHC in these cells are normal.|$|R
50|$|Beutler’s seminal work on G6PD {{deficiency}} led him {{to further}} explore <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> caused by various enzyme deficiencies. The systematic methodology that he developed became the standard approach to study of patients with these disorders.|$|R
50|$|Since 1982 it {{had been}} known that {{thrombotic}} thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), one of the microangiopathic <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> (see below), was characterized in its familial form by the presence in plasma of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF).|$|R
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b> They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Stomatocytoses are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} autosomal dominant <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> and include overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, hereditary cryohydrocytosis and familial pseudohyperkalemia. This article describes a novel variant of hereditary stomatocytosis due to a de novo band 3 mutation associated with signs of dyserythropoiesis. See related perspective article on page 1039...|$|R
50|$|Treatment for {{hemosiderin}} {{focuses on}} limiting {{the effects of}} the underlying disease leading to continued deposition. In hemochromatosis, this entails frequent phlebotomy granulomatosis, immune suppression is required. Limiting blood transfusions and institution of iron chelation therapy when iron overload is detected are important when managing sickle-cell anemia and other chronic <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias.</b>|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{metabolism}} of purified third {{component of}} complement labeled with 125 -iodine (C′ 3 - 125 I) was studied in normal subjects and {{in patients with}} acquired <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias.</b> 27 such studies were performed; in addition, three studies were performed using C′ 3 i, the biologically inactive reaction product of C′ 3...|$|R

50|$|Red Blood Cell ConditionsThere {{is a broad}} {{group of}} genetic {{diseases}} that result in either producing or predisposing afflicted individuals {{to the development of}} <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias.</b> For example, these diseases include, abnormal hemoglobin, inability to manufacture {{one or the other of}} the peptide globin chains of the hemoglobin, and deficiencies of the Embden-Meyerhoff monophosphate.|$|R
50|$|The alkylating agents used in {{immunotherapy}} are nitrogen mustards (cyclophosphamide), nitrosoureas, platinum compounds, and others. Cyclophosphamide (Baxter's Cytoxan) {{is probably}} the most potent immunosuppressive compound. In small doses, it is very efficient in the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias,</b> granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and other immune diseases. High doses cause pancytopenia and hemorrhagic cystitis.|$|R
50|$|TTP, as {{with other}} microangiopathic <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> (MAHAs), is caused by {{spontaneous}} aggregation of platelets and activation of coagulation in the small blood vessels. Platelets are consumed in the aggregation process and bind vWF. These platelet-vWF complexes form small blood clots which circulate in the blood vessels and cause shearing of red blood cells, resulting in their rupture.|$|R
25|$|The direct Coombs test is used {{to confirm}} that the fetus or neonate has an immune {{mediated}} <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin C (α2βC2) – Another variant {{due to a}} {{variation}} in the β-chain gene. This variant causes a mild chronic <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hemolysis is {{the general}} term for {{excessive}} breakdown of red blood cells. It can have several causes and can result in <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia.</b>|$|E
40|$|The general {{characteristics}} of anemia and the distinguishing features of hemolytic, hemorrhagic, hypo-proliferative, maturation abnormality, and iron-deficiency <b>anemias</b> are described. <b>Hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> are differentiated initially from hemorrhagic anemias by excluding hemorrhage on clinical, necropsy, or histologic examination. Next, they are {{distinguished from the}} remaining types of anemia {{on the basis of}} higher retic-ulocyte counts or, in some instances, by the very rapid rate of decline of the PCV. <b>Hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> are distinguished from each other on the basis of incidence and {{the presence or absence of}} a dose-response (idiosyncratic vs toxic) and by the cause of hemolysis (oxidative, nonoxidative, or immune-mediated). Hemorrhagic anemias are subclassified on the basis of single- and multiple-site hemorrhage. The causes of multiple-site hemorrhage (hemostasis dysfunction) are established by first- and second-line tests, the type of bleeding, clinical data, and the information gained from an evaluation of the structure, activity, and metab-olism of the compound...|$|R
25|$|Pigment gallstones {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} developing world. Risk factors for pigment stones include <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias</b> (such as from sickle-cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis), cirrhosis, and biliary tract infections. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) {{are at increased risk}} to develop gallstones. Additionally, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function, potentially leading to gallstone formation.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{reticuloendothelial system}} will remove the {{haptoglobin}}-hemoglobin complex from the body, haptoglobin levels will be decreased in <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemias.</b> In {{the process of}} binding hemoglobin, haptoglobin sequesters the iron within hemoglobin, preventing iron-utilizing bacteria from benefiting from hemolysis. It is theorized that, because of this, haptoglobin has evolved into an acute-phase protein. HP has a protective influence on the hemolytic kidney.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} {{can also cause}} {{mechanical}} <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> with hemolysis of the red blood cells as they pass through the valve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> can be {{developed}} after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin C/thalassemia: {{common in}} Mediterranean and African populations, {{hemoglobin}} C/βo thalassemia causes a moderately severe <b>hemolytic</b> <b>anemia</b> with splenomegaly; hemoglobin C/β+ thalassemia produces a milder disease.|$|E
