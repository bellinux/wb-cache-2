5|$|Furry {{conventions}} sometimes {{start out}} as furmeets, where groups of local fans meet at a regular location, often on a scheduled basis. As the local community grows, these groups may put on events which attract dealer attention or significant fan activity and which become recognized as <b>fully-fledged</b> conventions. Other conventions spring up {{in the wake of}} discontinued events; for example, Califur was founded in 2004 following the final ConFurence in 2003, in order to keep a furry convention in the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|Sora {{will return}} in and {{eventually}} become a <b>fully-fledged</b> Keyblade Master in Kingdom Hearts III, {{and will have}} his final showdown with Master Xehanort and the thirteen seekers of darkness. A 2D cartoonish avatar version of Sora wearing his original outfit in Kingdom Hearts is also present in the online community-based social gaming networking service, Kingdom Hearts Mobile. Many medals of Sora appear in the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Union Cross. Sora also appears in the Shiro Amano's manga and Tomoko Kanemaki's novels in which he reprises {{his role in the}} video games.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a <b>fully-fledged</b> sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established {{with the passage of the}} Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Tronstad {{moved to}} Trondheim {{to study at}} the Norwegian Institute of Technology, graduating in 1927. His {{graduation}} paper was deemed exceptional and as such was reported to King Haakon of Norway. Regarded as a <b>fully-fledged</b> academic work, it was published scientifically in 1928. Tronstad had taken various stray jobs while studying, and also finished his military service, reaching the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Norwegian Army Corps of Weaponry in 1927. From 1927 to 1928 Tronstad worked briefly as an assistant at the Norwegian Institute of Technology {{as well as in}} a private company in Kristiansand. In 1928 he returned to the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a research fellow. In the same year, Tronstad married Edla Obel, who was nine years his junior, in Trondheim. The couple had two children.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} under Robert's son, John Manners, who {{inherited the}} property {{as a minor}} in 1354. In 1355, when Sir Edward de Letham acquired the wardship of the property, the site {{was described as a}} fortalice, a weakly defended location, but by 1368, when the wardship passed to Joan, his widow, it was considered to be a <b>fully-fledged</b> castle. De Letham was a powerful regional figure, and may have been granted the wardship by Edward III in order to retain his loyalty in the face of military advances by the Scots; he and his wife allegedly ran down the surrounding estate, resulting in a commission being established to investigate the abuses.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were <b>fully-fledged</b> graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects editor Marc Varisco, who had {{previously}} collaborated with director Scott on the 2005 film Domino, worked again with Scott to develop Déjà Vu into a <b>fully-fledged</b> work. In total, approximately 400 visual effects scenes were shot during the production of Déjà Vu. They had acquired a LIDAR device, which incorporated lasers to scatter light {{with the intent of}} mapping out a small region, during the production of Domino; Scott and Varisco decided to use the apparatus again during the production of Déjà Vu. Additionally, the two utilized the Panavision Genesis high definition camera to film the shots that would encompass the past that the Snow White team would peer at throughout the film, as well as the various night scenes. The LIDAR apparatus, which was operated by a hired Texan company devoted to the device, performed scans of Claire Kuchever's apartment, the ferry, the ATF office, and actress Paula Patton, among others. Effects editor Zachary Tucker combined the elements created by the Texan LIDAR company with computer-generated graphics to make possible the scenes of time-travel experienced in the film.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a <b>fully-fledged</b> Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Wollaston {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} Medicine in 1986. She embarked on a career in hospital paediatrics but, after five years as a junior doctor in London, she moved to Bristol to train as a general practitioner, becoming a <b>fully-fledged</b> family doctor in 1992.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, {{the railway}} entered another era as M-real closed Sittingbourne Paper Mill, however, as one door closes, another opens - Church Marshes Country Park {{now has a}} {{managing}} committee and will see the surrounding area between Milton Regis Halt and Kemsley Down being turned into a <b>fully-fledged</b> country park.|$|E
25|$|This was {{perceived}} by most observers as a rationalisation of an unsustainable services market, and allowed not only iiNet, but also other providers such as Westnet, EFTel (itself an agglomeration of several ISPs formed in 2000), ArachNet and Global Dial among others {{to grow in}} the local market and to expand into <b>fully-fledged</b> national providers.|$|E
25|$|V12 Fen Street: The 'city street' of Fen Street {{runs through}} the Eastern Expansion Area, {{although}} more recent planning documents have treated the southern section through Magna Park as a grid road. This road is planned to run south as a <b>fully-fledged</b> grid road through a housing development {{on the site of}} Wavendon 9-hole Golf Course.|$|E
25|$|The Tudor Walters Committee that {{recommended}} {{the building of}} housing estates after World War One incorporated the ideas of Howard's disciple Raymond Unwin, who demonstrated that homes could be built rapidly and economically whilst maintaining satisfactory standards for gardens, family privacy and internal spaces. Unwin diverged from Howard by proposing that the new developments should be peripheral 'satellites' rather than <b>fully-fledged</b> garden cities.|$|E
25|$|After {{the attempt}} at making the first {{difference}} engine fell through, Babbage worked {{to design a}} more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman. The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to <b>fully-fledged</b> general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.|$|E
25|$|Although Goldmark {{was never}} an ardent {{follower}} of Wagner, the orchestration of Die Königin von Saba {{is reminiscent of the}} effects and formal fluidity that characterized so much of Wagner's work. Although Goldmark never adopted a <b>fully-fledged</b> system of leitmotifs, certain passages are reminiscent of Tristan und Isolde. The work also shows some influence of the dramatic sensibilities of Meyerbeer.|$|E
25|$|Syllables in Teochew {{contain an}} onset consonant, a medial glide, a nucleus, {{usually in the}} form of a vowel, but can also be {{occupied}} by a syllabic consonant like , and a final consonant. All the elements of the syllable except for the nucleus are optional, which means a vowel or a syllabic consonant alone can stand as a <b>fully-fledged</b> syllable.|$|E
25|$|Passages {{like this}} are {{interpreted}} by Darlington {{in his first two}} points above; there is more on variety and its origin in Chapter IV, p67-8. It is clear that Lawrence's understanding of heredity was well ahead of his time, (ahead of Darwin, in fact) and that he only lacks the idea of selection to have a <b>fully-fledged</b> theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|Because of the Linn LM-1's versatility, it {{superseded}} {{its intended}} purpose as an accompaniment tool {{and became a}} <b>fully-fledged</b> rhythm section for many synthpop and progressive acts. Along with the Roland TR-808, which was released around the same time, it is widely credited with legitimizing drum machines which, with a few notable exceptions, had previously largely been considered toys by most professional, mainstream musicians.|$|E
25|$|However, this dual remit precluded any {{transformation}} of TVNZ into <b>fully-fledged</b> public service broadcaster, and TVNZ's efforts to balance its pursuit of commercial performance and Charter objectives were soon being criticised. Despite some investment in local content, including new documentaries and discussion programmes, the content on TV One and TV2 remained {{similar to the}} pre-charter schedules, with a continuing high proportion of light entertainment and reality-TV shows.|$|E

25|$|In South Africa, the madaris {{also play}} a social and {{cultural}} role in giving after-school religious instruction to children of Muslims who attend government or private non-religious schools. However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend <b>fully-fledged</b> private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common today {{than it used to}} be.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 {{he joined}} {{the staff of the}} {{independent}} production company TalkBack Productions as a producer. At the time the company, which was founded by comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, produced radio programming, television advertisements and corporate videos. Fincham became the company's Managing Director in 1986, and in 1989 oversaw the move of TalkBack into <b>fully-fledged</b> television production when it produced its founders' sketch show, Smith and Jones, for BBC One.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{was heavily}} criticised. Plaid Cymru, the Official Opposition in the National Assembly from 1999–2007, {{attacked}} it for not delivering a <b>fully-fledged</b> parliament. Many commentators have also criticised the Labour Party's allegedly partisan attempt {{to alter the}} electoral system. By preventing regional Assembly Members from standing in constituency seats the party {{has been accused of}} changing the rules to protect constituency representatives. Labour had 29 members in the Assembly at the time, all of whom held constituency seats.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the CNL {{was created}} {{as a part of}} the Luxembourg {{national}} archives. The idea was to assemble all documents relating to the literary life in Luxembourg, both contemporary and historical, in a single place and thus to create a focal point for literary researchers. In addition to encouraging and facilitating research, the CNL also promotes contemporary literary output, by organising exhibitions, conferences, reading sessions and various events relating to literature in Luxembourg. Since 2005, the CNL is a <b>fully-fledged</b> independent cultural institute.|$|E
25|$|WikiToLearn, {{abbreviated}} WTL, {{is one of}} KDE's {{newest and}} most unique endeavors. It is a wiki (based on MediaWiki, like Wikipedia) that provides a platform to create and share open source textbooks. The idea {{is to have a}} massive library of textbooks for anyone and everyone to use and create. Its roots lay in University of Milan, where a group of physics majors wanted to share notes—then decided that it was for everyone and not just their internal friend group. They now are a <b>fully-fledged</b> KDE project with many universities backing it.|$|E
25|$|Ganji's {{writings}} {{in prison}} were smuggled out and widely distributed, {{especially on the}} web. Most notably he wrote a Republican Manifesto in six chapters in March 2002, laying out {{the basis of his}} proposal for a <b>fully-fledged</b> democratic republic for Iran. In particular he argued that all elections in the Islamic Republic of Iran must be boycotted. He later wrote a second book of his Republican Manifesto in May 2005, ahead of the ninth Presidential elections in Iran, specifically arguing for a complete boycott of the presidential elections.|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 1927 Ignacy Wygard, the {{vicepresident}} of Aerolot, {{initiated the}} creation of Polish Air Union. The union was formed by Aerolot, its main competitor Aero airline and Silesian Air Society operating the newly constructed Katowice-Muchowiec Airport and intending to become a <b>fully-fledged</b> airline. Eventually on 28 December 1928 all three companies were nationalised by the Polish government and merged to form LOT Polish Airlines, the Polish flag carrier. Interestingly, soon before the merger, Aerolot's former German partners also had merged to form Deutsche Luft Hansa, the flag carrier of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} for Famagusta was 1192 {{with the onset of}} Lusignan rule. It was during this period that Famagusta {{developed}} as a <b>fully-fledged</b> town. It increased in importance to the Eastern Mediterranean due to its natural harbour and the walls that protected its inner town. Its population began to increase. This development accelerated in the 13th century as the town became a centre of commerce for both the East and West. An influx of Christian refugees fleeing the downfall of Acre (1291) in Palestine transformed it from a tiny village into one of the richest cities in Christendom.|$|E
25|$|Rajagopalachari {{tendered}} {{his official}} resignation from the Indian National Congress {{and along with}} a number of other dissidents organised the Congress Reform Committee (CRC) in January 1957. K. S. Venkatakrishna Reddiar was elected president and the party fielded candidates in 55 constituencies in the 1957 state assembly elections, to emerge as the second largest party in Madras state with 13 seats in the legislative assembly. The Congress Reform Committee also contested 12 Lok Sabha seats during the 1957 Indian elections. The committee became a <b>fully-fledged</b> political party and was renamed the Indian National Democratic Congress at a state conference held in Madurai on September28–29, 1957.|$|E
25|$|William {{was also}} aware of rumours (though he {{rejected}} them) that Æthelstan's {{mother was a}} concubine, as propagated by “a certain Ælfred” who headed a group opposed to the succession. By the early 12th century, such rumours had given rise to <b>fully-fledged</b> popular traditions which reduced her to a low-born mistress, if still one of noble appearance. William cites an anecdote about Æthelstan's conception which he overheard from popular song (cantilena) and to which he gave only little credence himself. One day, when out of old affection, Edward the Elder visited his former nurse (nutrix), a reeve's wife, he met a beautiful shepherd's daughter who had been raised like a noblewoman. Edward slept with the unnamed girl, who bore him the future king called Æthelstan.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Ucamco {{published}} {{a proposal to}} add three new commands to the Gerber format which allow to include image attributes conveying metadata attached to the image and its components. It invited feedback from the Gerber users before committing these ideas to a firm specification. This process resulted in revision J1 from February 2014, updated with further revisions until revision 2015.07. Including metadata adds intelligence to the format. It converts a mere image description format to a <b>fully-fledged</b> PCB data transfer format. This is called the second extension and results {{what is known as}} Gerber X2, Gerber X1 being the pure image format. Gerber X2 is fully backward compatible with X1 - the attributes do not affect the image. Gerber X2 was developed by Karel Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} after the Second World War that Manchester United became a <b>fully-fledged</b> footballing power, but they picked up three league titles during the 1950s. Matt Busby {{was the man who}} had coached Manchester United to glory and he {{remained}} at the club until 1969. Meanwhile, across to the east, Leeds United had signed up former player Don Revie as their player-manager and he soon took the manager's post full-time. Manchester United's side during this era featured the likes of Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best, while under Revie Leeds had gained a reputation as a tough, uncompromising side, with the likes of Bobby's brother Jack Charlton, Billy Bremner, and Norman Hunter. Another key member of Revie's side was the Irishman Johnny Giles, who joined Leeds from Manchester United for £33,000 in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The fourth state reform, {{which took}} place in 1993 under Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, {{consolidated}} the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a <b>fully-fledged</b> federal state. The first article of the Belgian Constitution was amended to read as follows, “Belgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions”. During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, and the reformation of the Federal Parliament's bicameral system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.|$|E
