5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. He noticed that the man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that <b>he</b> <b>breathed</b> through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the suspect was Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E

Chashakhand a place near Phulari just about 15km east of Balasore has a park in his memorium as it was here he fought the British forces after crossing the Budha Balanga river which flows nereby.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as <b>he</b> <b>breathed,</b> all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

500|$|The Commission {{headed by}} Jacques Delors {{was seen as}} giving the Community a sense of {{direction}} and dynamism. Delors and his team are also considered as the [...] "founding fathers of the euro". The International Herald Tribune noted the work of Delors {{at the end of}} his second term in 1992: [...] "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, <b>he</b> <b>breathed</b> life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union".|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{soon came}} to the {{attention}} of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London, the Medical and Physical Journal published an article about him. They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as [...] A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that <b>he</b> <b>breathed</b> freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs. Doctors found tumefaction of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of erysipelas, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.|$|E

In neither of the three places, meanwhile, has he his fair share of that mysterious chemical agent without which health is impossible, the want of which betrays itself at once in the dull eye, the sallow cheek--namely, light. Believe me, it is no mere poetic metaphor which connects in Scripture, Light with Life. It is {{the expression of a}} deep law, one which holds as true in the physical as in the spiritual world; a case in which (as perhaps in all cases) the laws of the visible world are the counterparts of those of the invisible world, and Earth is the symbol of Heaven.|$|R

2500|$|It was {{incredible}} really. In 1977, I flew over to England {{with the players}} {{and that was the}} flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could imagine. But the secret still didn't get out.

Alder could be heard making [...] "gurgling" [...] noises as <b>he</b> <b>breathed</b> in and out through the pool of blood around his face. PS Dunn later explained that although he was aware of the gurgling he ignored it, believing Alder was deliberately blowing through the blood to [...] "try and upset" [...] the officers. PC Barr stated later that he had believed the noises [...] "were intended for our attention, in other words he was putting it on, which fitted neatly into what we had been told by PC Dawson." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meyer and Duncan {{made their}} first three vintages at the Christian Brothers winery, and in 1975 bought the Franciscan Winery, selling it in 1978 {{to buy the}} Silver Oak winery near Oakville and buying up new land. The Silver Oak winery began {{production}} in 1981 and the 1982 harvest was considered by Meyer to be [...] "something special" [...] and was attempted to be replicated in later years. Growth of the company from 1977 onwards enabled Silver Oak to purchase further vineyards in the 1980s and early 1990s, {{becoming one of the}} most successful Cabernet Sauvignon brands. By the 1994 vintage, the concept changed and the Silver Oak Napa became a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, but still aged solely in American oak, a California take on the classic Bordeaux chateau-bottled red wine. Meyer was President of the American Vineyard Foundation in the 1990s, and also held several other important positions in the wine industry. <b>He</b> <b>breathed</b> new life into the flailing American Vineyard Foundation from the late 1980s; Wines and Vines stated that Meyer's most important contribution will be his influence in bringing growers and winemakers together to shape the very future of California wine." [...] He trained Daniel Baron extensively to replace himself as Silver Oak's chief winemaker. In the late 1990s, he was diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes and a degenerative brain disease. In January 2001 he sold his share of the company to Ray Duncan, citing health problems, [...] but continued as a consulting winemaker until his death in August 2002. Meyer once said [...] "Only one wine can be your best, and I felt that cabernet was what we did best in Napa and Sonoma".|$|E
