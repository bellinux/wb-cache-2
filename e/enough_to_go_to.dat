25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 October 1952. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery and weapon fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing only long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

500|$|To Chinese minds, the heqin {{policy was}} humiliating and ran {{contrary}} to the Sinocentric world order like [...] "a person hanging upside down", as the statesman Jia Yi (d. 169 BC) puts it. These sentiments manifested themselves in the Han court {{in the form of}} the pro-war faction, who advocated the reversal of Han's policy of appeasement. By the reign of Emperor Wu (r.141–87), the Han felt comfortable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with the Xiongnu. After a botched attempt at luring the Xiongnu army into an ambush at the Battle of Mayi in 133 BC, the era of heqin-style appeasement was broken and the Han–Xiongnu War went into full swing.|$|E

500|$|When Pound told Dorothy {{about the}} birth, she {{separated}} from him {{for much of}} that year and the next. In December 1925, she left on an extended trip to Egypt. She was pregnant by her return in March. In June she and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of Le Testament de Villon, without mentioning the pregnancy to his friends or parents. In September, Hemingway drove Dorothy to the American Hospital of Paris {{for the birth of}} a son, Omar Pound. In a letter to his parents in October, Pound wrote, [...] "next generation (male) arrived. Both D & it appear to be doing well". Dorothy gave the baby son to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had a single pair of shoes, and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised in Kensington as an English gentleman by his sophisticated grandmother.|$|E

She launched the government's Campaign to Stop Violence Against Women, and urged other victims and their neighbours to speak up.

2500|$|Frustrated by the {{limitations}} the search had thus far encountered, and increasingly coming {{to believe that}} Ben's body was {{in an area of}} the cave no one had yet reached, the McDaniels offered a reward of $10,000, raised from money contributed at a benefit held on what would have been their son's 31st birthday, {{at the end of the}} year to anyone [...] "brave" [...] <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> those places and find it.

2500|$|Although the Union Navy {{would provide}} {{most of the}} gunnery that {{would be needed to}} {{suppress}} the Rebel batteries, Burnside decided to have some gunboats under Army control. This immediately led to some interference between the two services. The Navy had no vessels sturdy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sea {{and at the same time}} draw little enough water to be able to pass through the shallow inlet, thought to be about [...] They therefore had to buy suitable merchant ships for conversion, at the very time that Burnside and his agents were also dickering for their ships. Because the sailors were more experienced, they were able to get most of the more suitable ships. The Army was left with a mixed bag of rickety ships that were barely seaworthy. By the time the expedition got under way, the Navy had 20 gunboats, and the Coast Division had nine. The armada was supplemented by several canal boats converted into floating batteries, mounting boat howitzers and protected by sandbags and bales of hay. All told, the expedition carried 108 pieces of ordnance.|$|E
2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved.

He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone when you hit it first of all. Not a lot of guys these days are talented <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive.
