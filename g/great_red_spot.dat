5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in the}} southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot),</b> and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> but twice as large.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot.</b> A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E
6000|$|... 31. April 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. All {{these days}} I have been {{extremely}} ill, though I twice crawled out a week ago; but am now recovering, though very weak. The violence of my pain abated the night before last: I will just tell you how I was, and then send away this letter, which ought to have gone Saturday last. The pain increased with mighty violence in my left shoulder and collar-bone, and that side my neck. On Thursday morning appeared <b>great</b> <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> in all those places where my pain was, and {{the violence of the}} pain was confined to my neck behind, a little on the left side; which was so violent that I had not a minute's ease, nor hardly a minute's sleep in three days and nights. The spots increased every day, and bred little pimples, which are now grown white, and full of corruption, though small. The red still continues too, and most prodigious hot and inflamed. The disease is the shingles. I eat nothing but water-gruel; am very weak; but out of all violent pain. The doctors say it would have ended in some violent disease if it had not come out thus. I shall now recover fast. I have been in no danger of life, but miserable torture. I must not write too much. So adieu, deelest MD MD MD FW FW, ME ME ME, Lele. I can say lele yet, oo see.

40|$|A {{spectral}} reflectance study of selected lunar 'red spots', highland areas {{characterized by an}} absorption in the ultraviolet relative to the visible was conducted. Some <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> were suggested to be the sites of ancient highland volcanism. High-resolution spectral data of eight <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> on the western portion of the moon over the wavelength region 0. 39 - 0. 82 micron were obtained. Much spectral variation among these <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> in the magnitude {{as well as the}} wavelength position of the ultraviolet absorption were found. Spectral structure at visible and near-infrared wavelength were also identified. These spectral differences indicate that <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> do not have a single mineralogical composition, which in turn suggests that <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> may have multiple origins. Additional imaging spectroscopic observations were taken of the Herigonius <b>red</b> <b>spot,</b> a morphologically complex region northeast of Mare Humorum. These data reveal significant spectral differences among the various morphological units within the Herigonius <b>red</b> <b>spot.</b> Although some of these are likely due to the effects of the maturation process, others appear to reflect differences in mineral abundances and composition...|$|R
5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> when it faces Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter (5.2AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 {{times the}} mass {{of all the other}} planets put together. It is {{composed}} largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot.</b> Jupiter has 69 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Tinbergen and Perdeck {{tested the}} effects of visual stimuli on begging {{behavior}} by gull chicks, elucidating which characteristics of their parent's bills the chicks were reacting to. Using models varying in different characteristics, they tested multiple stimuli and found that gull chicks pecked most at a long, red bill with contrasting white bars at the end. Chicks also pecked at other models; in decreasing order of begging intensity were a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out {{of the head of}} a gull with a <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> on its bill, simply a bill with a <b>red</b> <b>spot,</b> and a cut-out of a gull's head with no <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> on the bill. These studies showed the chicks were responding to the <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> stimulus on their parents' bills, an example of imprinting.|$|R

5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{our understanding of}} the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past {{the planet in}} December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E

25|$|Jupiter {{is covered}} with a cloud layer about 50km deep. The clouds are {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. The best-known feature of the cloud layer is the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot,</b> but smaller in size. The feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of 2004, the <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> had {{approximately}} half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres.

25|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Spot</b> {{may have}} existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied {{only after a}} {{prominent}} apparition in 1879.
