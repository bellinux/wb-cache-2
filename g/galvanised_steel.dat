500|$|Between the two work-ins, {{the rear}} dormer was {{completed}} and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start {{to be made}} on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are ½ inch (13mm) thick and [...] wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the <b>galvanised</b> <b>steel</b> reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position.

40|$|<b>Galvanised</b> and {{galvannealed}} <b>steels</b> {{are widely}} used due to their good corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions. However, when additional protection is required, organic coatings, corrosion inhibitors or conversion coatings are used to improve their corrosion protection. In this work, sol-gel coating was used to improve the corrosion behaviour of these two materials. This paper analyses the final protective properties of a sol-gel coating prepared by basic catalysis and its dependence on the sintering temperature and time of treatment. The influence of the sintering conditions on the galvanised and galvannealed substrates is a decisive factor for the coating quality and for the barrier affect against the aggressive media. While heat treatment time is the controlling factor for the galvannealed steels, the temperature is determining {{in the case of}} the galvanised. Corrosion mechanisms for sol-gel <b>galvanised</b> <b>steels</b> did not changed with respect to the uncoated steel. However for galvannealed steel, after coating the mechanism is not purely cathodic. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{becomes one}} of the main concerns of our modern society. A huge amount of energy is wasted in industrial plants as low grade heat. Thermoelectricity is a promising way to partly harvest this heat. However, three main challenges prevent its implementation in large-scale applications: (i) available thermoelectric (TE) materials are expensive and cannot be mass-produced; (ii) the classical thermoelectric generator (TEG) structure is not adapted to large-scale applications; (iii) design methods adapted to large-scale TE systems do not exist. The objectives of this thesis were to face these challenges. Firstly, several prototypes of TEG have been developed using a low-cost TE material processable at large-scale, the Fe 2 VAl compound. Their characterisation showed the importance of the joining technique on the contact resistances and its inﬂuence on the performances of a TEG. Secondly, a new planar TEG has been proposed. The experimental proof-of-concept of this TEG has been carried out and models have been developed for the understanding and the design of this TEG. Finally, a global design procedure for large-scale TE systems based on multi-objectives optimisation has been proposed and applied to design a TE heat harvesting system adapted to a <b>galvanising</b> <b>steel</b> line. The power density of Fe 2 VAl-based TEG has been improved by several orders of magnitude when using techniques involving Cu-Fe 2 VAl reaction. The planar TEG developed during this thesis shows performances similar to classical TEG but could be processed more easily and at a lower cost. The global design procedure overcomes existing procedures. Finally, the TE system designed with this method for a <b>galvanising</b> <b>steel</b> line could recover more than 150 kW of electrical power through the use of Fe 2 VAl.

The objective of this work is to predict the hardness-load variation {{in relation to the}} bath immersion time using both a multilayer coating hardness model and a layers growth modelling. The kinetic growth of each layer relates the thickness to the immersion time by a simple power law. The hardness of the intermetallic compounds is determined by applying a multilayer hardness model on classical Vickers microindentation data obtained at different indentation loads. Afterwards by combining the kinetic growth laws and the compounds hardness, it is possible to predict the surface hardness-load variation {{as a function of the}} immersion bath time...|$|R

40|$|The {{simulation}} of the deep-drawing of square cups of coated <b>galvanised</b> <b>steels</b> using the explicit non-linear finite-element (FE) code DYNA- 3 D is reported. Based on the extensive verification procedure of the FE model regarding {{the selection of}} the suitable material and processing characteristics, described in detail in a companion paper for deep-drawing of axisymmetric cylindrical cups of the same materials, upper and lower limits of the simulated parameters are defined, bracketing, therefore, any optimal parametric prediction. The evaluation of the CPU time cost and comparisons between simulated values and experimentally predicted values, regarding strain distributions, punch load/punch travel curves and macroscopic deformation modes, which are in good agreement, indicate that the proposed model, under the assumptions and limitations made, well predicts the forming behaviour of deep-drawn components of various geometries.

40|$|Rapid {{electrode}} wear is {{the major}} concern in resistance spot welding Of <b>galvanised</b> <b>steels.</b> The electrode lift irt such instances is tremendously influenced by the continuous alloying reactions that occur between the molten free zinc and the copper electrodes. It {{is shown in the}} present work that the use of compound electrodes can considerably enhance the effective electrode life. The compound electrodes are fabricated by introducing a tungsten insert at the tip of conventional circular face electrodes. The performance of these new electrodes has been investigated under laboratory conditions during multispot welding. It is observed that the compound tip electrodes can offer superior electrode life only for a small insert size. A finite element method based numerical simulation has simultaneously been carried out. The results of the numerical calculation also indicate that the optimum design of the compound tip electrode depends on the insert size. (C) 2000 IoM Communications Ltd...|$|R
