40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to better understand the}} concept <b>of</b> celebratory <b>support.</b> This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is different from comforting messages and most other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> social <b>support,</b> which typically focus on trying to help people who are feeling bad to feel better; celebratory support aims to enhance the already positive feelings of someone who has received some kind of good news. In order to enhance understanding <b>of</b> this unique <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> this dissertation (a) reviewed the literature relevant to this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> (b) presented detailed conceptualization <b>of</b> celebratory <b>support,</b> and (c) described four different types of 2 ̆ 2 good news 2 ̆ 2 that often merit a celebratory response. Two studies were presented in this dissertation. Study 1 identified effective features <b>of</b> general celebratory <b>support</b> messages as well as some important contextual variations in better and worse <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> these message features. Study 2 identified effective features <b>of</b> context-specific celebratory <b>support</b> messages. Additionally, both studies also were able to hypothesis and test various mechanisms by which each set of features “work”. ...|$|R

In December, a VFT Concept Report was released, identifying the key issues for a high-speed rail system, to be built and operated by private enterprise, with trains operating between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne at speeds up to 350km per hour.

25|$|However, landlords {{routinely}} {{used the}} personal cultivation clause to evict tenants. There was another major barrier. A tenant {{would have to}} formally register his status (as a tenant) with the government. But few tenants registered, faced as they were with potential intimidation from their landlords, the removal of other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> such as consumption credit, {{and the prospect of}} a long and arduous legal battle if they truly wanted to dispute an eviction. Given this imbalance, landlords regularly exploited their tenants, either evicting them just before the harvest season, or giving them a lower share of the produce then they were entitled to, or refusing to give loans or charging extremely high rates of interest on loans taken for agricultural investments by the bargadar.|$|E
25|$|Part of the eco-socialist transition, in Kovel’s eyes, is the {{reforming}} {{money to}} retain its use in “enabling exchanges” while reducing its functions as “a commodity in its own right” and “repository of value”. He argues for directing money to “enhancement of use-values” through a “subsidization of use-values” that “preserves the functioning core of the economy while gaining time and space for rebuilding it”. Internationally, he believes in the immediate cessation of speculation in currencies (“breaking down the function of money as commodity, and redirecting funds on use-values”), the cancellation of the debt of the Global South (“breaking {{the back of the}} value function” of money) and the redirecting the “vast reservoir of mainly phony value” to reparations and “ecologically sound development”. He suggests the end of military aid and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to “comprador elites in the South” will eventually “lead to their collapse”.|$|E

25|$|The {{restructuring}} of the three armies into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents part of a wider process of 'thickening' the central state institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to mitigate some of the potential controversy around restructuring, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) made use of evidence of malpractice in Republika Srpska military institutions. Firstly, from 2002 onwards, OHR utilised a scandal around the provision of parts and assistance to Iraq in breach of a UN embargo (the so-called Orao affair) to support the cause for bringing governance of the armies under the level of central institutions. Following this, in 2004, the process was accelerated, drawing its justification from new evidence of material and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> flowing from Republika Srpska armed forces to ICTY indictee Ratko Mladić. OHR condemned the ‘systematic connivance of high-ranking members of the RS military’ and noted that measures to tackle such systematic deficiencies were under consideration. This was quickly followed by {{the expansion of the}} mandate for a Defence Reform Commission, which ultimately resulted in the consolidation of three armed forces into one, governed {{at the level of the}} central state.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{scholars}} {{also point}} out that a wide range of German soldiers, officials, and civilians were in some way involved in the Holocaust, from clerks and officials in the government to units of the army, police, and the SS. Many ministries, including those of armaments, interior, justice, railroads, and foreign affairs, had substantial roles in orchestrating the Holocaust; similarly, German physicians participated in medical experiments and the T-4 euthanasia program as did civil servants; German physicians also made the selections as to who was fit to work and who would die at the concentration camps.. Though there was no single department in charge of the Holocaust, the SS and Waffen-SS under Himmler had a leading role and operated with military efficiency in killing enemies of the Nazi state. From the SS came the SS-Totenkopfverbände concentration camp guard units, the Einsatzgruppen killing squads, and the main administrative offices behind the Holocaust, including the RSHA and WVHA. The regular army participated in the atrocities along with the SS on some occasions by taking part in the massacre of Jews in the Soviet Union, Serbia, Poland, and Greece. The German Army also logistically supported the Einsatzgruppen, helped form the ghettos, ran prison camps, occasionally provided concentration camp guards, transported prisoners to camps, had medical experiments performed on prisoners, and substantially used slave labor. Significant numbers of Wehrmacht soldiers accompanied the SS in their macabre tasks or provided other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for killing operations. The killings by the Einsatzgruppen required cooperation between the Einsatzgruppen chief and Wehrmacht unit commander so they could coordinate and control access to and from the execution grounds.|$|E
500|$|The {{funding of}} {{political}} parties, independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated {{in comparison with}} developed western democracies. Applicable legislation encompasses cash receipts, provision of free services (except the labour of volunteers), and products and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> (including membership fees). The legislation also stipulates that the government budget provides funding for political parties and non-partisan political representatives {{in the amount of}} 0.05 percent of the previous year's budget expenditures. Additional funds are appropriated in local government budgets. The funds are distributed to elected members of parliament and councils, and the political parties with which they are affiliated receive 10 percent of the funds. Each election candidate (or slate) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election-campaign donations, other related funding, and all campaign-related expenditures. The maximum donation to a single party, candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated. In cases of individuals it is set at 30,000kuna ( [...] 4,050euro), regardless of purpose. Companies and other legal persons are limited to the same amount in local elections; 100,000kuna ( [...] 13,500euro) for parliamentary or European Parliament elections and 200,000kuna ( [...] 27,000euro) for presidential elections to any one candidate, party or slate (whichever is applicable). Total campaign expenditures are also limited to 8million kuna ( [...] 1.08million euro) per candidate in presidential elections, 1.5million kuna ( [...] 202,000euro) per candidate (or slate) in European Parliament or parliamentary elections, 500,000kuna ( [...] 67,600euro) per candidate in Zagreb mayoral elections and 400,000kuna ( [...] 54,000euro) per candidate in county-prefect or mayoral elections in cities of 35,000 residents or larger and in county seats. Mayoral election-campaign expenditures in other cities and towns is also limited, depending on the local government's population: 250,000kuna ( [...] 33,800euro) if the population exceeds 10,000 residents, 100,000 kuna ( [...] 13,500euro) in population units of 3,000–10,000 and up to 50,000kuna ( [...] 6,750euro) in smaller self-governing units. All candidates and parties (or slates) are legally required to publish financial reports detailing their funding, which are audited by the State Electoral Commission and the State Audit Office. They are also legally required to turn over all receipts exceeding the legal limits in favour of the central government budget within eight days.|$|E

40|$|Stability {{and change}} {{in the use of}} formal and {{informal}} social support was assessed over a three year period among a representative sample of 1855 elderly urban participants in a longitudinal study of aging and health. Whether people received informal, formal, both types <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or no support was determined in baseline, 12 and 24 month personal interviews. Most respondents retained the same <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> across all three interviews. The extent of stability or change varied according to the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> reported at baseline. Two-thirds of those with no social support continued without support and 40 % of those using both informal and formal support continued to do so at subsequent assessments. The substitution of formal for informal support was infrequent and not statistically significant. Pair wise discriminant function analyses of groups of respondents with the most frequent longitudinal support patterns were performed to identify baseline health and social characteristics associated with stable use, the addition <b>of</b> another <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or change to nonuse, over time. Changes in the use <b>of</b> <b>support</b> were influenced more by initial levels of health and functional status than by social and economic circumstances.
