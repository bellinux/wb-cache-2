40|$|Although {{electric}} resistivity tomography (ERT) is now {{regarded as}} a standard tool in permafrost monitoring, high <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> continue to limit the acquisition of time series over complete freeze-thaw cycles. In an attempt to alleviate the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> problem, we have tested three electrode designs featuring increasing sizes and surface area, in the laboratory and at three different field sites in Greenland. <b>Grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements showed that changing the electrode shape (using plates instead of rods) reduced the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> at all sites by 28 %– 69 % during unfrozen and frozen ground conditions. Using meshes instead of plates (the same rectangular shape and a larger effective surface area) further improved the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> by 29 %– 37 % in winter. Replacement of rod electrodes of one entire permanent permafrost monitoring array by meshes resulted in an immediate reduction of the average <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> by 73 % from 1. 5 to 0. 4 kΩ (unfrozen conditions); in addition, {{the length of the}} acquisition period during the winter season was markedly prolonged. <b>Grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> time series from the three ERT monitoring stations in Greenland showed that the electrodes were rarely perfectly grounded and that <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> exceeding 1 MΩ may occur in severe cases.

Still, little information is available on <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> in the geophysical literature, mainly because it is difficult to measure. The focus-one protocol is a new method for estimating single electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> by measuring the resistance between a single electrode in an ERT array and all the remaining electrodes connected in parallel. For large arrays, the measured resistance is dominated by the <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> of the electrode under test, the focus electrode. We have developed an equivalent circuit model formulation for the resistance measured when applying the focus-one protocol. Our model depends on the individual <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> of the electrodes of the array, the mutual resistances between electrodes, and the instrument input impedance. Using analytical formulations for the potentials around prolate and oblate spheroidal electrode models (as approximations for rod and plate electrodes), we have investigated the performance and accuracy of the focus-one protocol in estimating single-electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances.</b> We also found that the focus-one protocol provided accurate estimations of electrode <b>grounding</b> <b>resistances</b> to within 7 % for arrays of 30 electrodes or more when the ratio of instrument input impedance to the half-space resistivity was 1000 m− 1 or more. The focus-one protocol was of high practical value in field operations because it helped to optimize array installation, electrode design, and placement.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{transmitting}} antenna, the quarter wave monopole, is physically large at these frequencies (25 to 250 m requiring a tall radio mast. Usually the metal mast itself {{is used as}} the antenna, and is mounted on a large porcelain insulator to isolate it from the ground; {{this is called a}} mast radiator. The monopole antenna, particularly if electrically short requires a good, low resistance Earth ground connection for efficiency, since the <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> is in series with the antenna and consumes transmitter power. Commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many heavy copper cables, buried a few feet in the earth, radiating {{from the base of the}} antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength.

5000|$|The largest use of counterpoises is in {{transmitters}} on the {{low frequency}} (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) bands, as they {{are very sensitive to}} <b>ground</b> <b>resistance.</b> Because of the large wavelength of the radio waves, feasible antennas used at these frequencies are electrically short, their length is {{a small fraction of the}} wavelength. The radiation resistance of antennas (the resistance that represents power radiated as radio waves) drops as their length becomes small compared to a wavelength, so the radiation resistance of antennas on the LF and VLF bands is very low, often as low as one ohm or less. The other, larger resistances in the antenna-ground circuit can consume significant portions of the transmitter’s power. The largest resistance in the antenna-ground circuit is often the ground system, and the transmitter power is divided proportionally between it and the radiation resistance, so the resistance of the ground system has to be kept very low to minimize the [...] "wasted" [...] transmitter power.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a loading coil. The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel loading coils and grounds rather than one, the equivalent loading coil and <b>ground</b> <b>resistance,</b> and therefore the power dissipated in the loading coil and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna.
