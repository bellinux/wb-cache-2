40|$|<b>Imazapyr</b> is a broad-spectrum {{herbicide}} in the imidazolinone family. Its primary uses in the U.

Imazapyr-containing herbicides are irritating to both eyes and skin. Adverse effects found in laboratory animals after chronic exposure to <b>imazapyr</b> include the following: fluid accumulation in the lungs of female mice, kidney cysts in male mice, abnormal blood formation in the spleen of female rats, {{an increase in the}} number of brain and thyroid cancers in male rats, and {{an increase in the number}} of tumors and cancers of the adrenal gland in female rats. <b>Imazapyr</b> can persist in soil for over a year.

40|$|<b>Imazapyr</b> is a non-selective {{herbicide}} {{used for the}} control of {{a broad range of}} weeds including terrestrial annual and perennial grasses and broadleaved herbs, woody species, and riparian and emergent aquatic species. It controls plant growth by preventing the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Because <b>imazapyr</b> is a weak acid herbicide, environmental pH will determine its chemical structure, which in turn determines its environmental persistence and mobility. Below pH 5 the adsorption capacity of <b>imazapyr</b> increases and limits its movement in soil. Above pH 5, greater concentrations of <b>imazapyr</b> become negatively charged, fail to bind tightly with soils, and remain available (for plant uptake and/or microbial breakdown). In soils <b>imazapyr</b> is degraded primarily by microbial metabolism. It is not, however, degraded significantly by photolysis or other chemical reactions. The half-life of <b>imazapyr</b> in soil ranges from one to five months. In aqueous solutions, <b>imazapyr</b> may undergo photodegradation with a half-life of two days. <b>Imazapyr</b> is not highly toxic to birds and mammals, but some formulations (for instance, the inert ingredients in Chopper ® and Stalker®) can cause severe, irreversible eye damage. Studies indicate <b>imazapyr</b> is excreted by mammalian systems rapidly with no bioaccumulation. It has a low toxicity to fish, and algae and submersed vegetation are not affected. Because <b>imazapyr</b> can affect a wide range of plants and can remain available, care must be taken during application to prevent accidental contact with non-target species. Further, a few studies have reported that <b>imazapyr</b> may be actively exuded from the roots of legumes (such as mesquite), likely as a defense mechanism by those plants. This exudate and the ability of <b>imazapyr</b> to move via intertwined root grafts may therefore adversely affect the surrounding desirable vegetation with little to no control of the target species...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of herbicide residues {{applied to the}} soil is commonly conducted by using chromatographic techniques which use organic solvents, are costly and time consuming. Having a simple and inexpensive discriminant method to determine samples with and without herbicide residues would be highly beneficial to lower costs of analysis and save time. The general objective of the present work was to develop such methodology. In particular, the presence of <b>imazapyr</b> was quantified using a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a chemometrics approach. The experimental soil for a qualitative experiment of discrimination was Phaeozem with different agricultural managements and the following treatments: dry soil doped with <b>imazapyr,</b> rehydrated soil also doped with the herbicide, and control soil without the chemical. A discriminant algorithm was developed to allow the identification of soils containing <b>imazapyr</b> and those which did not contain the herbicide. The qualitative approach {{was based on a}} discriminant partial least squares (DPLS). An accurate identification of 100 percent of the soils containing <b>imazapyr</b> and 98 percent of those which did not contain the pesticide was achieved. Quantification of <b>imazapyr</b> was performed in five soil types (Andosol, Vertisol, Acrisol, Cambisol and Phaeozem) with different concentrations of the herbicide with an equation generated by modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression. As a reference for the above analytical method, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed. The resulting equation had a RSQ of 0. 81 and a prediction capacity (RPD) of 2. 4. The results showed that with NIR spectroscopy it was possible to discriminate soils that contained <b>imazapyr</b> from those that did not contain the herbicide. This finding allows for a {{reduction in the number of}} samples to be evaluated to determine their concentration. Moreover, with this technique it is also possible to estimate the amount of herbicide in the soil with similar results to those accomplished using the reference method (HPLC), but faster and at lower cos...|$|E
40|$|Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) {{techniques}} {{on power}} line rights-of-way (ROWs) have successfully reduced {{environmental and economic}} costs of vegetation management by selecting techniques that facilitate the establishment of stable, low-growing plant communities. To test whether IVM principles {{can be applied to}} ROWs in northern Canada, I investigated the impacts of eight management strategies on plant communities in Yukon, Canada. Because forestry herbicide applications are not common in Yukon, I also examined the acute toxicity of <b>imazapyr</b> and triclopyr to non-target plants in standardized greenhouse tests with common boreal herbs. For treatments, triclopyr and <b>imazapyr</b> were each applied by three methods: broadcast spray, cut stump and point injection. Additional treatments were mechanical mowing or cutting target species and seeding native grasses. Vegetation cover surveys were completed before treatments and repeated after one year along with visual herbicide damage assessments. ROW plant communities were significantly altered by management methods one year after treatment, but clear directional changes were not yet evident. Herbicide treatments were more effective at target species control than mechanical methods. All treatments caused a minor reduction in non-target species cover. <b>Imazapyr</b> applications caused more damage to non-target species than triclopyr. Other treatment impacts were life form (e. g. shrub, forb, etc.) or species-specific. Vegetative vigour tests and seedling emergence and seedling growth tests in five ROW soils were used to assess toxicity of both herbicides to Achillea millefolium and Chamerion angustifolium. Test results supported field findings: <b>imazapyr</b> was more toxic than triclopyr. Foliar Inhibition Concentration (IC) 50 estimates were 0. 7 and 1. 2 % of the maximum <b>imazapyr</b> application rate vs. 31 % for A. millefolium and triclopyr (C. angustifolium’s could not be calculated). Soil applied triclopyr caused IC 50 estimates of 2 - 20 µg g- 1 and <b>imazapyr</b> IC 50 estimates were 50 % of residues remained after 30 days and indicates further research into triclopyr dissipation and risks to wildlife in northern ecosystems is needed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Imazapyr</b> has {{presented}} excellent results in controlling coppices in stand reforms of eucalypt forests, despite {{differences in the}} efficacy levels. To find out whether these different responses are caused by the genetic variability of the cultivated materials, two experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions with different <b>imazapyr</b> doses in a hydroponic system in plastic vases containing 2, 500 mL solution. The clones IEF- 1 (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus sp. hybrid), GE 463 (E. urophylla x E. grandis), and MN 445 (E. grandis x Eucalyptus sp. hybrid) {{were used in the}} first assay, and IEF- 1, IEF 2 (E. grandis x E. urophylla) x Eucalyptus sp. hybrid) and the clones 129 and 7182 (E. grandis x Eucalyptus sp. hybrids) in the second assay. Thirty days after transplanting the seedlings to a nutritive solution, <b>imazapyr</b> was applied to the solution at doses of 0. 00, 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 40, 0. 80, 1. 60 and 3. 20 muL L- 1. Clone GE 463 proved to be more tolerant to <b>imazapyr</b> than clones IEF- 1 and MN 445 in the first assay; however, in the second, clone 7182 was the most tolerant.

Phytoremediation is shown as a promising technique to decontaminate soils polluted by herbicides. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential of some winter grown species in removing residuals from soils contaminated with imazethapyr + imazapic and imazapic + <b>imazapyr,</b> using pre-emergence to control weeds in summer grown rice fields. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with four replications. All species were subjected to herbicide application at different doses. Imazethapyr + imazapic and <b>imazapyr</b> + imazapic were applied at doses of 0. 0, 1. 0 and 2. 0 L ha- 1, and 0. 0, 140 and 280 g ha- 1, respectively, in pre-emergence of the species. Brassica napus and Festuca arundinaceae are not tolerant to herbicides, with 100 &# 37; of phytotoxicity (plant death) for all doses assessed. The herbicide <b>imazapyr</b> + imazapic proved to be less selective, causing the highest phytotoxicity in the species tested. The most tolerant species to the herbicides was Vicia sativa, which may be the most suitable one for phytoremediation programs in areas contaminated with imazethapyr + imazapic and <b>imazapyr</b> + imazapic...|$|E
40|$|A mobilidade dos herbicidas no perfil do solo é influenciada por vários processos, tais como, retenção, transformação e transporte. O conhecimento destes fenômenos é {{fundamental}} para a perfeita compreensão do destino de tais produtos no ambiente. Dentre as várias técnicas utilizadas nesses estudos, o método do bioensaio apresenta-se como de ótima representatividade e reprodutibilidade. Em razão dessas características, associadas a poucas informações sobre a mobilidade de herbicidas nos solos sob condições tropicais, foi conduzido um bioensaio objetivando verificar o movimento vertical do glyphosate e do <b>imazapyr,</b> em colunas de solos de diferentes texturas e composição química, utilizando-se o tomateiro (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill var. Santa Clara) como planta-teste. Os resultados desse estudo permitiram concluir que: a) o limite de detecção do bioensaio para o glyphosate e para o <b>imazapyr</b> corresponde ao menor valor de I 50, obtido na curva padrão, 331, 52 e 5, 4 µg L- 1, respectivamente; b) as concentrações do glyphosate biologicamente ativo nos lixiviados dos solos de Viçosa e de Sabará encontram-se abaixo do limite de detecção do bioensaio; c) o glyphosate apresentou, na coluna de 1 cm, mobilidade muito baixa nos solos estudados; d) a mobilidade do <b>imazapyr,</b> na coluna de 30 cm, é maior no solo de textura francoarenosa de Viçosa; e) o alto teor de argila e de matéria orgânica do solo de Sabará apresentam-se como os principais fatores de retenção do <b>imazapyr</b> nesse solo. The herbicide mobility in {{the soil}} profile is influenced by several processes: retention, transformation and transport.
