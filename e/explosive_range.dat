5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system {{is used to}} prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the <b>explosive</b> <b>range.</b> IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more hydrocarbon vapour {{is likely to be}} present in the tank atmosphere.

This knowledge involves the properties of the gas itself, an awareness of where these accumulations are likely to occur, and facts on how methane mixes safely into the mine air. The other chapters in this handbook address the handling of methane under a variety of specific circumstances, such as at continuous miner faces or coal storage silos. This chapter addresses some broad concepts that serve as a foundation for the suggestions provided in other chapters. THE EXPLOSIBILITY OF METHANE GAS MIXTURES Methane entering a mine or tunnel often enters as a localized source at high concentration. Figure 1 - 1 depicts a cloud of methane being diluted into a moving air stream. In this illustration, methane enters the mine from a crack in the roof. As the methane emerges from the crack, it progressively mixes with the ventilation air and is diluted. In the event that this progressive dilution reduces the concentration from 100 % to 1 %, 2 as shown in Figure 1 - 1, the methane passes through a concentration range of 15 % to 5 %, known as the <b>explosive</b> <b>range.</b> In the <b>explosive</b> <b>range,</b> the mixture may be ignited.

When the shearer is cutting from MG towards TG, the maximum gas concentration close to the coal face can reach as high as 2. 00 %, a situation which may not be detected timely by gas sensors currently mounted on the shearer.

In various freshwater systems in Europe, populations of native amphipods and fish are progressively displaced by highly adaptive non-indigenous species that can perform <b>explosive</b> <b>range</b> extensions. A total of 40 Ponto-Caspian round gobies Neogobius melanostomus from the Rhine River near Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, were examined for metazoan parasites and feeding ecology. Three metazoan parasite species were found: two Nematoda and one Acanthocephala. The two Nematoda, Raphidascaris acus and Paracuaria adunca, had a low prevalence of 2. 5 %. The Acanthocephala, Pomphorhynchus tereticollis, was the predominant parasite species, reaching a level of 90. 0 % prevalence in the larval stage, correlated with fish size. In addition, four invasive amphipod species, Corophium curvispinum (435 specimens), Dikerogammarus villosus (5, 454), Echinogammarus trichiatus (2, 695) and Orchestia cavimana (1, 448) were trapped at the sampling site. Only D. villosus was infected with P. tereticollis at a prevalence of 0. 04 %. The invasive goby N. melanostomus mainly preys on these non-indigenous amphipods, and may have replaced native amphipods in the transmission of P. tereticollis into the vertebrate paratenic host.

40|$|Ethylene oxide (EtO) {{is widely}} used by health care {{institutions}} as a sterilant because of its potency in destroying pathogens.

40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{developing}} low emission combustors operating on natural gas or LPG, to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx. The possibility of burning very lean fuel mixtures is studied. To initiate the ignition and combustion stabilization the discharge generated by the quasi-optical microwave is used. Main Results. Initiating ignition by streamer microwave discharge increases the rate of combustion and combustion efficiency about four times as compared with the conventional spark ignition. Streamer discharge ignition by very lean fuel-air mixture is demonstrated with the factor of oxiding agent excess greater than the limit of <b>explosive</b> <b>range</b> under normal conditions. According to indirect indicators, ignition by microwave discharge created by quasi-optical radiation is of non-thermal nature. Microwave discharge excites oxygen atoms, and intense ultra-violet radiation is generated as a result that causes formation of cold nonequilibrium plasma with avalanche growth of free electrons. Streamer discharge propagates at a speed of 5 km /s, so the initiation of the ignition occurs immediately throughout. The temperature of the fuel mixture at the point of ignition initiation does not exceed 400 К. There is no area with a temperature sufficient to initiate thermal Zeldovich mechanism of emission of nitrogen oxides. Combustion rate is high. As a result the Fenimore mechanism of "fast nitrogen oxides" has no chance to be progressing, and NOx emissions in appreciable quantities are excluded. Energy costs are comparable with spark ignition. Practical Relevance. The studied technology is designed for low emission internal combustion engines, power gas turbines, gas compressor units, fueled by natural gas...|$|E
40|$|Explosions in U. S. {{coal mines}} have caused death and injury to miners and {{destruction}} of workings since the first reported explosion in 1810. These explosions are caused when buildups of explosive gas and/or dust in the mine are ignited {{by the presence of}} a flame or spark. Methane gas is inherently generated and held by adsorption in coal and is normally liberated during mining. Because this gas is explosive in the range of 5 %- 15 % by volume, fresh air is constantly supplied to the working face to prevent the methane/air mixture from reaching this <b>explosive</b> <b>range.</b> The required amount of ventilation air is based on estimates of gas release under normal conditions. Occasionally, unanticipated and unusually high emissions are encountered, which, despite normal ventilation controls, result in an explosive mixture that a spark from a cutting bit or electrical equipment can easily ignite. Investigations have shown that such emissions are often associated with anomalous geologic features or conditions. Although most operators are aware that certain geologic features may adversely affect productivity, few are aware of their potential as a gas emission hazard. This report presents a historical framework detailing the impact of geologic features on excess gas emissions and resultant mine explosions. It also provides operators with specific information on recognizing and alleviating potential hazards from methane emissions related to these geologic features.
