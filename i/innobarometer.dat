40|$|The paper quantifies {{the impact}} of {{agglomeration}} economies on the clustering of German firms. Therefore, I use the 2006 <b>Innobarometer</b> survey, which focuses on cluster characteristics and activities of German firms, to empirically identify agglomeration economies derived from the New Economic Geography and Marshall externalities. At the industry specific level, I find that within-industry spillovers are important for German low-tech firms but not for high-tech firms or knowledge intensive firms. At the department level, Marshall externalities such as hiring skilled labor and technological spillover effects are empirically confirmed for some departments like Human Resources or R&D but rarely for others like Production.

40|$|We {{begin with}} an {{overview}} of innovation in services using two existing data-sets. In Chapter 2 we compare the extent and orientation of innovation in services and manufacturers across Europe using the <b>Innobarometer</b> survey. In Chapter 3 we draw on the second European Community Innovation Survey (CIS- 2) and look primarily at patterns of innovation within services, highlighting in particular how these patterns vary within and between various service ‘sectors’. In Chapters 4, 5 and 6 we report {{the results of the}} original research undertaken for this study. Chapter 4 introduces the four ‘sectors’ that were analysed for this study. These ‘sectors’ were: road transportation and logistics; information processing; care for the elderly; and design. In Chapter 4, we provide an overview of these activities and outline, using case studies some of the innovations that have been introduced within them. Chapter 5 then presents the findings of the questionnaire survey which was undertaken for this study. The results pertaining to each of the sectors are outlined in turn. Chapter 6 then attempts to draw the evidence together, through the use of multivariate statistical methods, to examine the ‘drivers of innovation’ in services. Chapter 7 looks at the empirical evidence concerning the factors hampering innovation in services. This chapter draws on evidence from the <b>Innobarometer,</b> the second European Community Innovation Survey, and the ‘Four Sector Survey’ which was undertaken for this project. Chapter 8 concludes the report with a summary of the findings and an outline of policy related suggestions...|$|E
40|$|This study confronts two {{perspectives}} {{on the role of}} universities in regional innovation systems. The first one is the political and administrative perspective, under which „higher education institutions, like airports, have become magic bullets in many regional development strategies” (OECD, 2007) or pillars to the EU innovation policy. The second perspective results from industry innovation studies (<b>Innobarometers)</b> and reveals a weak demand from the business community to interact and make use of the knowledge base of universities. Using secondary data analysis, this study brings evidence from empirical studies, official statistics and regional planning documents. The results have implications for regional decision-makers, as well as for regional innovation actors. regional innovation systems, universities/ higher education institutions (HEIs), innovation policies, secondary data analysis, <b>Innobarometers.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Present paper {{present an}} {{approach}} of the Research-Development and Innovation System (RDI) in Europe during the last decade. After a short introduction is presented the European Union formation. Research, development and innovation (RDI) has been studied and analyzed since 2001 by the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS). Will be presented in the present paper a summary of all the materials from EIS 2001 till IUS 2011. Study concerning RDI system in Europe was done from <b>innobarometers</b> from 2001 till 2010. EIS 2007 presents {{for the first time}} the European innovation leaders. EIS presents innovative performance of Member States based on annual statistical data collected from national statistical sources of each member country of the European Union through the Community Innovation Survey by using Document Analysis on Innovation Community. Were taken into account, after this short presentation, the relevant composite indicators for European Union for the last decade to analyze the Research-Development and Innovation System in Europe. IUS 2011 distinguish between three main types of innovation indicators. The main input factors in the analysis of external innovation performance of firms covers 3 dimensions of innovation. These indicators, based on the IUS 2011, contain as follows: Human Resources with the evolution of new doctorate graduates, population completed tertiary education, youth with upper secondary level education, Research Systems, Finance and Support. All of these indicators belongs to the category of Enablers. Another indicators studied in the present paper are Firm activities, Linkages & entrepreneurship Intellectual Assets. From the category of Outputs there are Innovators and Economic effects. The composite indicators for EU Research Development and Innovation System were study for the period 2006 - 2011. Samples data were took from Pro Inno Europe database for simulations in August 2012.

40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceRecent work {{on national}} systems of innovation {{has argued that}} there are systemic relations between national labour market and education and training systems, and the dynamics of knowledge creation and innovation at the enterprise-level. Building on the insights of this research, this paper used aggregate data available on Eurostat's electronic data base and enterprise-level data from the 2007 <b>Innobarometer</b> Survey to estimate a multi-level logistic model examining simultaneously the impact of enterprise-level and national-level variables on the likelihood of an enterprise innovating. The results show that innovative performance is supported by national systems of 'flexicurity' which combine flexibility on the labour market with the generous provision of unemployment protection {{including the use of}} active labour market policies and well-developed systems of life-long learnin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{advanced}} {{economies are}} increasingly dominated by services, relatively {{little is known}} about whether and how services innovate. Instead, our understanding of innovation and innovation processes has been very largely derived from studies of manufacturing, and the production of technologically advanced artefacts. As services do not generally produce technologically advanced artefacts, they are often considered to be non-innovative, or “supplier-dominated” recipients of technologies rather than “true innovators”. An alternative perspective is that services tend to innovate differently from manufacturers, or at least that innovation in services brings to the fore “softer” aspects of innovation based in skills and inter-organisational cooperation practices which are pervasive across the economy but which do not tend to be prominent amongst manufacturers, and are therefore neglected. We examine these issues through an empirical analysis of a survey of European firms which was carried out in 2002.

40|$|The slow {{progress}} of innovation in transition economies {{is not related}} just to firms’ decision to invest in innovation activities. Rather, it is worth distinguishing between their decision to increase investment, reduce it, keep their investments {{at the same level}} or not invest in innovation activities at all. To understand these decisions we develop and estimate models for post-transition and developed European countries employing multinomial probit. The analysis relies on responses of 2580 firms from 11 post-transition countries and 4058 firms from 18 European countries collected by the Flash Eurobarometer 433 - <b>Innobarometer</b> 2016 survey. We have established that the firms’ decision making process in general is mostly related to previous innovation investment experience. In transition countries, the higher the percent of turnover invested in innovation, the lower the probability of an increase in the future. In the firms operating in developed economies, lower turnover from new products is related to the decision to decrease innovation investment in the future...|$|E
40|$|Users play an {{important}} part in innovation processes and outputs. Both firms and consumers have needs that must be understood for a product to stand any chance of success. They also possess expertise that is potentially valuable for product development. Users may even modify existing products or develop new ones in response to their own needs, possibly anticipating future market demand in the process. However, despite a large body of literature exploring these and other aspects of user involvement in innovation, we still know relatively little about the scale and importance of these activities. This study is the first to explore user innovation amongst a large sample of European firms engaged in innovative activities. It provides new insights into the ways in which European firms innovate and how they engage with their user populations. The report draws on the results of the 2007 and the 2009 <b>Innobarometer</b> surveys to systematically address two inter-related sets of questions: • How prevalent is user innovation amongst a large sample of innovating firms in the EU? • How are firms engaged in user innovation different from the whole population of innovating firms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{currency}} union of past era in Central Eastern Europe {{was a result}} of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Austria- Hungary kept a multinational realm but only joint foreign affairs, defense, finance managed by common ministries. Their autonomies had been brought in development of the short period on science, technology and industrialization. i. e. a lot of patents or inventions. Although such technological changes had accelerated industrialization, due to socio-economical inequality conditions until the world war I,II and former Soviet, CEE had not achieved a sustainable economic growth. Todays, however reviewing {{as a part of the}} EU, this article says the difference amid the changes in CEE innovation under the small open economy through Eurobarometer since 2004. The industrial R&D investment has decreased gradually, even the survey also shows that the trends in innovation investment have been shrinking. Despite the open innovation policy of EU is keeping abreast with that of CEE for employment and R&D collaborate. By the <b>innobarometer,</b> there were expection gaps of conception for innovation to use the new method or introduction of it in CEE. Among cases of Czech and Poland, Hungary they each were belong to the higher level or lowest by expectation or willpower of the innovation. The R&D abilities are absolutely not leading to the economic growth and technology development, but being stimulated for growth and being needed to act as competitive edge by co-effort of local public and corporate strategy compared with Korea briefly...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of public services {{is one of}} the priorities on the agendas of all policies, both national and European. One of the most recent concerns of the European Commission, as shown in the 2010 <b>Innobarometer,</b> is to find ways and develop strategies to support the innovation in the public administration sector, {{in the context of the}} continuously changing economic background. In this paper, we‘ll investigate the relationship between e-Government, and the overall innovation performance at national level, for some European Union countries. e-Government is already a known concept, widespread in the world, promoting the implementation of information and communication technologies in the public administration, in order to provide better public services to citizens and businesses. A main component of the e-Government concept is the “counter reform”, aimed to streamlining administrative act quickly in order to respond to the demands of citizens, businesses and government structures. Innovation in e-Government will be measured with two Eurostat indicators – “e-Government on-line availability ” and “e-Government usage by individuals ” – while for the overall innovation performance we’ll use a composite indicator – the Summary Innovation Index (SII) – from the Innovation Union Scoreboard (IUS). In Romania, even if the values of these indicators are not at the level of other EU countries, we can say that the situation has improved and electronic public services are being used increasingly often. The study also includes a comparison between two „modest innovators”: Romania and Bulgaria. Regarding the overall innovation performance, according to the 2010 Innovation Union Scoreboard ranking, Romania is the leader of the “modest innovators ” countries, overcomin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceptions}} of young students, who are training {{in the field of}} economics, to the very new products and outlines the role that marketing plays in bringing to market products based on innovative technologies. The study is conducted in Romania and tries to highlight Romanian specific features about the relationship between marketing and innovation. The goal is to outline in a clear and actual image of young people thoughts about new technologies insertion on the market. The pursued objectives are: motivation investigation of option for new products; determining predisposition to the radical or incremental innovations, assessing perceptions of the link between marketing and innovation. Research have been made in this field on various areas of activity. At the level of the European Community there are several organizations which activate in the field of innovation research. Eurobarometer through its subdivision <b>Innobarometer</b> brings in the attention of the public on a regular basis, through a series of publications, the results of researches undertaken from the business perspective, and are concerning all areas of action. Research aims to identify the impact that new technologies have on the consumers most open to innovation. This exploratory research is based on a direct gathering of information, using an online questionnaire. Data are processed using SPSS software package, and the results show the type and nature of links between variables to be examined by applying bivariate and multivariate correlation tests. Analysis report provides descriptive, easy to follow, for all the situations covered and investigated in the questionnaire. The results show a clear output of the relationship between compromises that those open to using new technologies are making to obtain superior advantages from the newest products on the market. Research carried out by the author being the first one in this area, only manages to outline the general framework of marketing in the process of bringing new innovations to market. Other research focused on several areas of participants in the process of bringing innovations to market, like inventors, distributors, intermediaries and final consumers, will be undertaken in the future. The study bring into the attention of all participants in economic exchanges that marketing tools can be used to accelerate or to stop different directions of development. Marketing strategies and techniques can be implemented centrally in the economic environment of a country or communities, with immediate impact in the development (subject to certain priorities) of the society as a whole. Marketing can facilitate all socio-economic activities, starting from helping people interested in obtaining patents, attract their results into the economic cycle (production), going through transfer of the products to consumers (distribution), continuing to explain and inform all parties involved (promotion) and ending with the recording and collection of profits (price) of any kind (tangible or intangible). Although the literature treats {{for a long time and}} in various ways the relationship between marketing and innovation, research on this direction in Romania are relatively few undertaken. Identification and assessment of consumer perceptions is an important step in any development process, especially in processes with a high innovative component, and this study tries to highlight Romanian characteristics of the relationship between marketing and innovation...|$|E
