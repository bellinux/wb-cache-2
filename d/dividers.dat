5|$|As {{with all}} but the first scene of the Matsudaira scroll, this scene is set {{on the evening of}} Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwai of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō. The {{painting}} shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kichō room <b>dividers</b> featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Shōshi, with the baby in her arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the <b>dividers</b> between each gill).|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} <b>dividers</b> between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} repeating patterns. They {{are characteristic}} of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room <b>dividers,</b> providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden <b>dividers</b> to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
25|$|Long rectangular-dash <b>dividers</b> usually {{separate}} normal lanes. Short rectangular-dash <b>dividers</b> usually {{indicates a}} lane that {{is ready to}} turn into an exit, a merging lane, or a lane reserved for vehicles that have difficulty climbing high grade regions of the freeway.|$|E
25|$|Creed uses a {{large number}} of effects on his voice and his guitar, {{including}} echoes, phase shifters, flangers, guitar synthesizers, fuzz, and octave <b>dividers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cherub {{with the}} <b>dividers</b> {{suggests}} how a navigator {{is supposed to}} use the grid to calculate alargar and avanzar by visual measurement rather than manipulating numbers.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 film To Live and Die in L.A. {{featured}} a stunt in a terminal at LAX of Petersen {{running along the}} top of the <b>dividers</b> between the terminal's moving sidewalk.|$|E
25|$|For {{major roads}} risk {{can be reduced}} by {{providing}} limited access from properties and local roads, grade separated junctions and median <b>dividers</b> between opposite-direction traffic to reduce likelihood of head-on collisions.|$|E
25|$|Suppose the {{reference}} signal is 100kHz, and the divider can be preset to any value between 1 and 100. The error signal {{produced by the}} comparator will only be zero when {{the output of the}} divider is also 100kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100kHz for a count of 1, 200kHz for a count of 2, 1MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of {{the reference}} frequency can be obtained with the simplest integer N <b>dividers.</b> Fractional N <b>dividers</b> are readily available.|$|E
25|$|The Hammond Novachord {{released}} in 1939, was an electronic keyboard that used twelve sets of top-octave oscillators with octave <b>dividers</b> to generate sound, with vibrato, a resonator filter bank and a dynamic envelope controller. During {{the three years}} that Hammond manufactured this model, 1,069 units were shipped, but production was discontinued {{at the start of}} World War II. Both instruments were the forerunners of the later electronic organs and polyphonic synthesizers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{architectural}} {{details are}} still {{present on the}} building: above the gate, <b>dividers,</b> symbol of architecture, are set above a small barrel, recalling the profession of the first landlord. Two slight avant-corps balanced {{each side of the}} edifice. On the first floor, the middle part is enhanced by flanking pilasters with rosettes topped by a balustrade. Corbel tables crowns the facade, the ensemble is overlooked by a series of gable wall dormer.|$|E
25|$|Four {{fragments}} of stone steles: documents a, g, h, and j, with 116, 37, 7, and 13 characters respectively. The characters are carefully carved, with conspicuous interlinear baselines ("monumental style"). Dunand suggests that fragments h and j originally {{belonged to the}} same monument; the chemical composition of the limestone of both seems identical. The text on fragment g is written vertically, in five columns. Block j has vertical strokes, apparently as word <b>dividers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the stone}} steps is the {{building}} complex, which was {{centered on a}} yard. The buildings had characteristic French clay tile roofing, the better to provide insulation and ventilation, and bitumen flooring. Continuous site improvements to accommodate {{the high number of}} migrants were carried out, including the installation of planked walls as room <b>dividers</b> by the late 1850s. By 1865, transportation needs led to the construction of a railway, cutting the Immigration Depot into two. Walls were constructed along the track.|$|E
25|$|The shot of Petersen {{running along}} the top of the <b>dividers</b> between the terminal's moving {{sidewalk}} at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.|$|E
25|$|The shunt {{connection}} results in smoother transfer characteristics and lower signal distortions, {{but also in}} a lower modulation range (−60dB). This limitation is lifted by connecting two shunt <b>dividers</b> in series, which keeps the transfer characteristic smooth. The best combination of a smooth transfer characteristic, low distortion, wide range of adjustment, and nearly equal rates of increase and decrease of the transmission coefficient is achieved in a series-parallel circuit composed of two ROs and a series resistor. The frequency response of such circuit {{is similar to that}} of the series connection.|$|E
25|$|James H. Rand Jr. {{was born}} on November 18, 1886, to James and Mary (Jameson Scribner) Rand in North Tonawanda, New York. He was a descendent of John Rand, {{one of the founders}} of Charlestown, Massachusetts. His father, James Rand, worked in the banking {{industry}} for many years. Realizing that bank clerks had to thumb through large numbers of index cards for information, James Rand Sr. invented the first commercial system of <b>dividers,</b> file tabs and index cards and founded the Rand Ledger Company to manufacture the index system.|$|E
25|$|The grid {{throughout}} most of Miami-Dade County, {{with the exception of}} a few cities such as Coral Gables, is a simple axis-oriented numbered street pattern. Flagler Street forms the north–south divider and Miami Avenue forms the east–west divider between roads. Hence, all streets travel east–west and all avenues travel north–south, with the numbers increasing uniformly away from the <b>dividers.</b> Nearly all streets are referred to and indicated by number and all have a prefix (NW, NE, SW, SE) to determine their quadrant. Many of the busier, arterial roads, are also known by their common name, such as West 42nd Avenue, which is often referred to as LeJeune Road.|$|E
25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room <b>dividers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Integration {{with the}} setting extends even to small details. For example, where glass meets stone walls no metal frame is used; rather, {{the glass and}} its {{horizontal}} <b>dividers</b> were run into a caulked recess in the stonework so that the stone walls appear uninterrupted by glazing. From the cantilevered living room, a stairway leads directly down to the stream below, and in a connecting space which connects the main house with the guest and servant level, a natural spring drips water inside, which is then channeled back out. Bedrooms are small, some with low ceilings to encourage people outward toward the open social areas, decks, and outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Smart's unsentimental {{paintings}} encompass lonely urban vistas {{that seem}} both disturbing and threatening. Isolated individuals seem lost in industrial wastelands, full of high rise construction, concrete street-scapes and an eerie feeling of harmony and equilibrium – where silence and stillness create a deathly ambience. 'The express rape of the landscape' is one title hanging over Smart's paintings, {{referring to the}} freeways, street signs, trucks, oil drums, containers, buildings and concrete <b>dividers</b> that are the ever-present subjects of his work. At the same time his paintings – full of bold colours and perfect symmetry – are beautiful. The repetition of road signs in his works, for example, suggest an inconclusive direction and a world outside the frame is tantalising suggested.|$|E
25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but the vents of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the anteroom by <b>dividers</b> (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to the space around it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|The main venue, Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre, {{received}} a facelift with an upgraded lobby, entrance and a facade which was lighted at night. 100,000 flowers and shrubs {{were used to}} beautify the landscape around the area {{as well as other}} parts of the island, including Orchard Road, Suntec's vicinity as well as the East Coast Parkway. These plants included frangipani trees, fox palms and heliconias, as well as other types of plants, coming in different colours, shapes and sizes, planted along pavements and road <b>dividers.</b> This showcased the tropical plants of the island to the world as well. Flyovers and the City Hall undergone repainting and works to repave the areas near Suntec City were pushed forward to prepare for the annual meetings. Also, walkways have been resurfaced by the Land Transport Authority. At Singapore Changi Airport, posters were put around the terminals of the airport to welcome the delegates from different countries.|$|E
25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass <b>dividers.</b> The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the married}} couple Eggenberg-Herberstein, the 24 {{rooms of the}} piano nobile were {{refurbished}} according to the tastes of the Rococo starting in the mid-18th century. In addition to new pieces of furniture, chandeliers and sconces, and high-quality faïence stoves, nearly all the rooms also received brand-new, monochrome silk damask wall coverings. Five rooms in the north tract of the piano nobile were equipped with large painted canvasses. Styrian artist Johann Anton Baptist Raunacher dedicated each room to a different subject; shepherd's games, theatrical scenes and gambling scenes are found alongside society scenes and hunting scenes in Schloss Eggenberg. It was during this phase that the Eggenberg palace theater was converted into a palace church in the Baroque style. In addition, three exquisite East Asian cabinets were integrated into the sequence of rooms. The first two are adorned with valuable Imari porcelain plates and bowls as well as Chinese silk paintings. In the wall coverings of the third cabinet, eight panels of a precious Japanese folding screen have been used. These traditional <b>dividers</b> portray the palace and the fortified town of Osaka before 1615, whereby it can be determined that these panels were executed shortly thereafter. From the early modern era {{there are very few}} of these screens depicting the city before its destruction, so these works are especially noteworthy. On account of the viewpoint on Osaka the Eggenberg panels represent a unique exhibit.|$|E
500|$|A {{symbol for}} power <b>dividers</b> {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Power <b>dividers</b> and {{directional}} couplers are in all essentials the same class of device. [...] Directional coupler tends to be used for 4-port devices that are only loosely coupled – that is, {{only a small fraction of}} the input power appears at the coupled port. [...] Power divider is used for devices with tight coupling (commonly, a power divider will provide half the input power at each of its output ports – a [...] divider) and is usually considered a 3-port device.|$|E
500|$|One may {{visualize}} an oligonucleotide microarray as {{a miniature}} multi-well plate where physical <b>dividers</b> between the wells (plastic walls) are intentionally removed. With {{respect to the}} chemistry, synthesis of oligonucleotide microarrays {{is different from the}} conventional oligonucleotide synthesis in two respects: ...|$|E
500|$|Directional {{couplers}} {{and power}} <b>dividers</b> have many applications. [...] These include providing a signal sample for measurement or monitoring, feedback, combining feeds {{to and from}} antennae, antenna beam forming, providing taps for cable distributed systems such as cable TV, and separating transmitted and received signals on telephone lines.|$|E
500|$|Applications of {{the hybrid}} include {{monopulse}} comparators, mixers, power combiners, <b>dividers,</b> modulators, and phased array radar antenna systems. [...] Both in-phase devices (such as the Wilkinson divider) and quadrature (90°) hybrid couplers {{may be used}} for coherent power divider applications. [...] An example of quadrature hybrids being used in a coherent power combiner application is given in the next section.|$|E
500|$|Power <b>dividers</b> (also power {{splitters}} and, {{when used}} in reverse, power combiners) and directional couplers are passive devices used mostly {{in the field of}} radio technology. They couple a defined amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit. [...] An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction. [...] Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port but not to the coupled port. [...] A directional coupler designed to split power equally between two ports is called a hybrid coupler.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of filters whose design objectives are {{something other than}} rejection or passing of certain frequencies. [...] Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. [...] However, a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes {{on the nature of}} a filter. [...] Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks, directional couplers, power <b>dividers,</b> power combiners, and diplexers. [...] Other possible applications include multiplexers, demultiplexers, negative-resistance amplifiers, and time-delay networks.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{transmission line}} power <b>dividers</b> were simple T-junctions. [...] These suffer from very poor isolation between the output ports – {{a large part}} of the power reflected back from port 2 finds its way into port 3. [...] It can be shown that it is not theoretically possible to simultaneously match all three ports of a passive, lossless three-port and poor isolation is unavoidable. [...] It is, however, possible with four-ports and this is the fundamental reason why four-port devices are used to implement three-port power dividers: four-port devices can be designed so that power arriving at port 2 is split between port 1 and port 4 (which is terminated with a matching load) and none (in the ideal case) goes to port 3.|$|E
500|$|At high power, arcing {{can occur}} {{at the corners of}} the filter teeth due to strong {{electric}} fields being present at sharp corners. [...] This limits the power-handling capability of the filter. [...] The effect can be mitigated by rounding the edges of the teeth. [...] Completely circular teeth are best of all for power handling. [...] Circular teeth will handle about 1.4 times the power capability of square teeth without arcing. [...] For instance Matthaei describes a [...] passband filter with rounded teeth and a wide stopband with a power-handling capability of [...] [...] A similar filter with circular teeth, on the other hand, can handle [...] [...] Using power <b>dividers</b> to connect filters in parallel and then combining their outputs can provide even greater power handling.|$|E
500|$|The {{corridors}} {{were reduced}} in width and included angled bulkhead <b>dividers,</b> with exposed conduits {{added to the}} ceiling to convey a claustrophobic feel reminiscent of the submarine film The Hunt for Red October. Narita changed the bright, smooth look of the Enterprise bridge that had been created by Zimmerman for The Final Frontier by lighting the set as spottily as possible. [...] "I didn't want to use too much smoke on the Enterprise, because I didn't want it to end up looking too much like the Klingon starship. For that reason I decided to keep {{the look of the}} Enterprise pretty clean, but with a little more contrasty lighting," [...] Narita said. Meyer acknowledged that had he been the creator of the franchise, [...] "I would have probably designed a much more claustrophobic world because it's much more dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] <b>Dividers</b> are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer, the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent. [...] Lossless multiplexing can only be done with filter networks.Naval Air Warfare Center, pp.6.4.4, 6.4.5 ...|$|E
