Characterization includes ultra noise and chemical degradation, " 1 H and " 1 " 3 C nmr spectroscopy, molecular weight determination, viscosimetric and rheological studies and application tests for textile printing. The superiority of CMSEC in textile printing is explained {{in the frame of}} structure-property-relations.
