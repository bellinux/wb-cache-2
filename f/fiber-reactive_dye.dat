50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dye</b> (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} of wool fabric produced {{a significantly higher}} level of adsorbed <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dye</b> when applied at 50 °C (pH 3. 0 – 6. 0) {{in the absence of}} any organic leveling agent. In addition, color yields indicated that dye was more uniformly adsorbed by the plasma-treated fabric compared with the untreated material. When untreated fabric was dyed in the presence of a leveling agent (Albegal B), the extent and levelness of dye sorption were enhanced. These enhancements were, however, relatively small on the plasma-treated wool compared with those on untreated wool. A ‘surface’ mechanism, similar to that proposed when plasma-treated wool is dyed in the absence of leveling agent, can explain the leveling ability of Albegal B under adsorption conditions. Increasing the dyebath temperature to 90 °C resulted in dye penetration of the fibers. Under these conditions, any enhancements of dye uptake produced by the {{plasma treatment}}, as well as the use of Albegal B, were relatively small, in contrast to the behavior at 50 °C. Improvements in the uniformity of dye sorption observed at 50 °C were, however, maintained at the higher temperature. It is concluded that the inability of reactive dyes to migrate (and so promote leveling and uniformity) once they have reacted with the fiber, means that differences in the uniformity of dye sorbed at 50 °C are still apparent at equilibrium. <br /...|$|E
30|$|Fiber {{reactive}} dyes {{will form}} a covalent bond while they react with the cellulosic fiber. As a result {{they are very}} difficult to remove, once attached with the fiber. Initially, these dyes were designed for cellulose fibers but now some <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> for protein and polyamide fibers are also commercially available.|$|R
25|$|In <b>dyeing</b> with <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dyes,</b> sodium {{carbonate}} (often under a name such as soda ash fixative or soda ash activator) {{is used to}} ensure proper chemical bonding of the dye with cellulose (plant) fibers, typically before dyeing (for tie dyes), mixed with the dye (for dye painting), or after dyeing (for immersion dyeing).|$|R
5000|$|Vat dyes are a {{class of}} dyes that are {{classified}} as such because of the method by which they are applied. Vat dyeing {{is a process that}} refers to dyeing that takes place in a bucket or vat. Almost any <b>dye,</b> including <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dyes,</b> direct dyes, and acid dyes, {{can be used in a}} vat dye. Cotton, wool, and other fibers can be all dyed with vat dyes. The original vat dye is indigo, once obtained from plants but now produced synthetically.|$|R
5000|$|Vat dyes {{characteristically}} {{require a}} reducing agent to solubilize them. The most common reducing agent is sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), which converts the dye to its [...] "leuco" [...] form that is soluble. Once {{attached to the}} fabric, the leuco dye is then oxidized to the insoluble state which is intensely colored. Chemical reactions such as oxidation, reduction, pH control are often necessary; even the dissolution process necessitates measuring out appropriate quantities of caustic soda and sodium hydrosulphite {{in order to achieve}} reduction. The dye is soluble only in its reduced (oxygen-free) form. The fiber is immersed repeatedly in this oxygen-free dyebath, then exposed to the air, whereupon the water-soluble reduced form changes color as oxygen turns it to the water-insoluble form. For these reasons, vat dyes are less suitable than <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dyes</b> for amateur use.|$|R
50|$|While {{exhibited}} at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Uklanski's abstract sculpture Untitled (Story of the Eye) almost stole the viewers' attention from his photography works that were hung on the walls around it. Made of multiple layers of <b>fiber-reactive</b> <b>dyed</b> oxidized jute and hemp textile, cotton and nylon rope, polyester batting, resin, aluminum, and steel. The piece peers over its viewers at 12 feet in height. The work doesn't look like a rendition of an eye immediately, until the viewer notices the overlapping bright orange and white weaved centerpiece, hanging by rope of the same colors. Wrapped and sculpted around the dangling pupil are larger pieces of material fashioned together with a thicker rope. Instead of continuing the use of bright colors, a deep burgundy, dark violet, grey, and silver tinged blue material are threaded through one another, creating an enormous eye muscle. Towards {{the bottom of the}} piece, each different colored fabric, except the burgundy, transform into braided tassels with fringe at the end- a couple of which are orange from the pupil's tassels- which hang heavy, dragged down by gravity. Uklanski's artistic choices with this piece demonstrate his Modernism style and his appreciation for visual pleasure, ensuring that looking upon the sculpture is easy, following the lines of the work create a soft and light looking structure, even though the color and materials themselves are quite the opposite. In fact, due to the expressive use of color and dramatic draping of material one might be reminded of stage designs by Polish artists in the 50's and 60's.|$|R
40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{this work}} to {{increase}} the efficiency of the conventional dyeing process using ultrasonics or to replace the conventional dyeing medium water with supercritical carbon dioxide, saving water and energy costs to realize an ecological and also an economical profit. Using ultrasonics (approx. 10 W/cm 2) in a conventional dyeing process leads to a faster dyestuff consumption of the wool fibre, a deeper depht of shade and higfher levelness. The influence of the ultrasonic waves lead to a fester penetration of the wool fibre surface but no faster diffusion inside the fibre. No kind of ultrasonic-induced fibre damage could be detected. It could also be shown {{that it is possible to}} dye wool in deep shades and with high levelness and fastness properties in a water-free dyeing process using supercritical carbon dioxide instead of water. To match the fastness standards of today it is necessary to use <b>fiber-reactive</b> disperse <b>dyes</b> or mordant dyes on a pre-mordanted wool fabric. Small amounts of modifier are inevitable for deep shades and high levelness. It is possible to recycle the modifier with the carbon dioxide. The water-free dyeing conditions allow higher dyeings temperatures up to 120 °C. Without any detectable wool fibre damage, this reduces the dyeing process for more than 30 %...|$|R
