5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E

Clearing the dam site began immediately afterwards, in addition to the construction of access roads and a camp for construction workers. Construction of the dam's service spillway began a week later on August 29. On September 22, 1967, work began on the <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> that would allow the river to bypass the construction site. The [...] tunnel was fully excavated by March 13 of the following year and lined with reinforced concrete by August.

500|$|After the {{clearing}} of over [...] {{of the future}} reservoir site and the relocation of several roads that ran through it, the <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> was closed and water began to rise behind New Don Pedro. The rising lake submerged Old Don Pedro Dam on April 12, 1970 and inundated the Gold Rush town of Jacksonville by June. The powerhouse and penstocks were completed by August 1970, after lengthy delays and setbacks due to the sheer scale of the generators, pipes and gates used in their construction. Some of the individual components were so heavy that a truck delivering one of the penstock sections sank up to its trailer bed in the road, and another was crushed when the driver braked, inadvertently snapping the chains that held the load in place.|$|E
500|$|Although new {{proposals}} surfaced {{from time}} to time after the 1980s, the dam was never built for a number of reasons, including limited water storage capacity, geologic hazards, and potential harm to recreation and the local environment. Much of the original groundwork at the Auburn Dam site still exists, and up to 2007, the North Fork American River still flowed through the <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> that had been constructed in preparation for the dam. Reclamation and Placer County Water Agency completed a pump station project that year which blocked the tunnel, returned the river to its original channel, and diverted water through another tunnel under Auburn to meet local needs. [...] However, some groups continue to support construction of the dam, which they state would provide important water regulation and flood protection.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, the U.S. Geological Survey sent Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence {{into the}} canyon {{to look for a}} site to build a [...] <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{bringing}} water to the Uncompahgre Valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. Torrence, a Montrose native and an expert mountaineer, had taken part in a failed expedition the previous year, and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion. He opted to bring a single rubber air mattress instead of the heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey {{into the canyon}}. They entered the canyon on August 12 equipped with [...] "only hunting knives, two silk lifeline ropes, and rubber bags to encase their instruments." [...] After a harrowing 10 days braving rock falls, waterfalls, and 76 river crossings, they emerged from the canyon with a suitable tunnel site.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, {{construction}} on the New Waddell Dam began with the excavation of its foundation. A <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> was constructed along with another to divert water releases from the Old Waddell Dam to the Beardsley Canal. Construction on the dam's intakes continued through 1991, {{and by the end}} of 1992, a controlled breach was performed on two arches of the Old Waddell Dam, allowing its reservoir to fill freely behind the New Waddell Dam, which was already mostly inundated. By 1994, the reservoir was filled and had nearly tripled the size of the Old Waddell Dam reservoir. In that same year, the dam's pump-generating plant (New Waddell Pump-Generating Plant) began operation. The dam's cost was in excess of $625 million. Large sediment releases from the New Waddell Dam deteriorated the Camp Dyer Diversion Dam [...] downstream. This masonry dam had to be rehabilitated by the Bureau in 1992.|$|E
500|$|A {{pumping station}} to supply {{water to the}} Placer County Water Agency was built in 2006 on the Middle Fork American River, {{supplying}} [...] to a northwest-running pipeline, {{eliminating the need for}} Auburn Dam for this supply. The capacity of the station is eventually expected to be upgraded to [...] By 2006, the Bureau of Reclamation itself began to restore the dam site, which then had been untouched for more than a decade. The river <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> was sealed but not filled in, and the remnants of the construction site in the riverbed as well as the remains of the cofferdam excavated out of the canyon. After the riverbed was leveled and graded, an artificial riverbed with manmade Class III rapids was constructed to channel the river through the site. The restoration project also included the construction of other recreational amenities in the Auburn site. This act was seen as the final step of decommissioning the Auburn project and shelving it forever.|$|E
500|$|Actual {{construction}} {{began in}} July 1966 with clearing {{of the dam}} and reservoir site, construction of access roads, foundation preparations and excavations for the future outlet works. A <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> to allow the river to bypass the dam site was excavated between 1966 and December 1973. The Corps opened bids for construction of the main dam on October 10, 1972. Melones Contractors (a consortium formed by Guy F. Atckinson Company, Gordon H. Ball, and Arundel Corp.) won the primary construction contract for $109.7 million, while Allis-Chalmers and General Electric took an $11.5 million contract to provide turbines and hydroelectric generating equipment. During reservoir clearing operations, the USACE spent about $28 million relocating roads and bridges in the future reservoir space. Foundation work for the dam itself began on March 6, 1974 with the first embankment material placed in January 1976. Much of the embankment fill came from an excavation shortly northwest of the dam, which would later serve as the dam's spillway. During the height of construction in the summer, the total workforce reached about 800, while averaging between 500–600 in the winter months.|$|E

500|$|The flood rapidly {{filled the}} pool behind the Auburn {{cofferdam}} to capacity, as the <b>diversion</b> <b>tunnel</b> could not handle {{all the water}} pouring into the reservoir. At about 9:00 A.M. on February 18, the rising water overtopped the cofferdam near the right abutment, creating a waterfall that quickly eroded into the structure. Although the cofferdam was designed with a soft earthen plug to fail {{in a controlled manner}} if any such event were to occur, the structure eroded quicker than expected. The outflow reached [...] by noon; several hours later the maximum discharge was reached at , completely inundating the construction site and destroying almost half of the cofferdam. When the [...] high cofferdam collapsed, its backed-up water surged downstream into already-spilling Folsom Lake less than a mile downstream, deposited the dam debris and raised the lake level suddenly. Folsom Dam outflow reached , which exceeded the design capacity of levees through Sacramento, but the levees were not overtopped and severe flooding in the city was averted by a close margin. The flood events {{made it clear that the}} American River flood control system was inadequate for the flood potential of the watershed. This spurred renewed interest in the Auburn Dam, since a permanent dam would have helped store extra floodwater and also prevented the failure of the cofferdam.|$|E
