40|$|Ozone is well {{documented}} as the air pollutant most damaging to agricultural crops and other plants. It is reported that tropospheric O 3 concentration increases rapidly in recent 20 years. Evaluating and predicting <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone concentration changes on crops are drawing great attention in the scientic community. In China, main study method about this led is controlled experiments, for example, Open Top Chambers. But numerical simulation study about <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone on crops with crop model was developed slowly, what is more, the study about combined <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone and carbon dioxide has not been reported. The improved agroecosystem model is presented to evaluate simultaneously <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> tropospheric O 3 and CO 2 concentration changes on crops in the paper by integrating algorithms about <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone on photosynthesis with an existing agroecosystem biogeochemical model (named as DNDC). The main physiological processes of crop growth (phenology, leaf area index, photosynthesis, respiration, assimilated allocation and so on) in the former DNDC are kept. The algorithms about <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone on photosynthesis and winter wheat leaf are added in the modied DNDC model in order to reveal <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> ozone and carbon dioxide on growth, development, and yield formation of winter wheat by coupling the simulation about <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide on photosynthesis of winter wheat which exists in the former DNDC.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{integrated}} model that explains performance <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> IS {{at the individual}} level. We include nature of IS use, task-technology-fit and IS use as determinants <b>of</b> performance <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> IS at the individual level. Based on data from 434 respondents from different functional areas in six different organizations, we empirically validate the integrated model for an individual IS productivity application. Our results indicate that integrated model explains nearly 60 % {{of the variance in}} performance <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> IS at the individual level. Overall, the results provide support to our position that the integrated model provides a fuller understanding <b>of</b> performance <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> IS at the individual level by including both task-technology-fit and nature of IS use, an aspect not addressed in the extant IS literature. The theoretical contribution of this research lies {{in the development of a}} model for performance <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> IS that has significantly higher explanatory power than the existing models.

40|$|Identifying the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> various design {{strategies}} on {{satisfying the}} requirements of the target system is one of the important tasks in requirement engineering. In this paper, we proposed a systematic approach to analyze and reason the positive/negative <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on imprecise requirements. In our approach, we use fuzzy logic to capture the elasticity of requirements, to represent requirements, and to identify relationships between requirements. In order to analyze the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements, we explicitly represent design strategies in terms of requirements. We also developed a systematic reasoning scheme for reasoning the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements using the identified requirement-requirement and requirement-design relationships. The goal <b>of</b> identifying the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements is to reduce the conflicts between requirements and design strategies, to guide design engineers in evaluating design alterna [...] ...|$|R
