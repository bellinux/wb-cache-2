25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} have historically {{focused on the}} textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern {{scholars have}} increasingly begun deconstructing. This biblical polemics, states Naomi Janowitz, a professor of Religious Studies, has distorted the reality of Israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in Judaism. The <b>direct</b> <b>material</b> evidence is more reliable, such as that from the archaeological sites, and {{this suggests that the}} Jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest. Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter.|$|E

The French, I think, never quite accepted this point of view; but it was certainly the British attitude; and in this atmosphere the pre-Armistice conditions were framed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTOC's basic {{vocabulary}} emphasizes its philosophy and its three performance measures. Throughput equals sales revenue minus <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> cost [...] it measures {{the speed at}} which the company makes money. Inventory is the raw materials value tied up in work in process and finished goods. Large amounts of inventory are undesirable because it means that the company has spent money for production that hasn’t generated revenue yet. Operating expenses are all of the costs of operations other than <b>direct</b> <b>materials</b> costs. Under the Theory of Constraints, operating expenses are fixed and therefore irrelevant to any TOC decision. Of the three terms, throughput is the most important. It tells the company that it is achieving its goal of making money. Moreover, increases in throughput mean that {{the rate at which the}} company is making money is increasing. So far, we’ve discussed increasing speed and output and improving quality, but we haven’t mentioned any of the conventional management accounting performance measures (i. e., productivity, cost per unit, etc.). TOC won’t suggest using any of them, either. Moreover, according to TOC, not only are conventional management accounting performance measures unnecessary, but focusing on them can make things worse...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to review the changes in {{translucency}} of <b>direct</b> esthetic restorative <b>materials</b> after curing, aging and treatment. As a criterion for the evaluation of clinical translucency changes, visual perceptibility threshold in translucency parameter difference (ΔTP) of 2 was used. Translucency changes after curing were perceivable depending on experimental methods and products (largest ΔTP in resin composites = 15. 9). Translucency changes after aging were reported as either relatively stable or showed perceivable changes by aging protocols (largest ΔTP in resin composites = - 3. 8). Translucency changes after curing, aging and treatment were perceivable in several products and experimental methods. Therefore, shade matching of <b>direct</b> esthetic <b>materials</b> should be performed considering these instabilities of translucency in <b>direct</b> esthetic <b>materials...</b>|$|R
