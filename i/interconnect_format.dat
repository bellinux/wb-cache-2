5000|$|MADI was {{developed}} by AMS Neve, Solid State Logic, Sony and Mitsubishi and is widely used in the audio industry, especially in the professional sector. It provides advantages over other audio digital interface protocols and standards such as AES/EBU (AES3), ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape), TDIF (Tascam Digital Interface), and S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Format).</b> These advantages include: ...|$|E
50|$|The Tascam Digital <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Format</b> (TDIF) is a {{proprietary}} format connector defined by TASCAM that is unbalanced {{and uses a}} 25-pin D-sub cable to transmit and/or receive up to eight channels of digital audio between compatible devices. Unlike the ADAT lightpipe connection, TDIF uses a bidirectional connection, meaning that only one cable is required to connect the eight {{ins and outs of}} one device or another.|$|E
50|$|S/PDIF is a {{data link}} layer {{protocol}} {{as well as a}} set of physical layer specifications for carrying digital audio signals between devices and components over either optical or electrical cable. The name stands for Sony/Philips Digital <b>Interconnect</b> <b>Format</b> but is also known as Sony/Philips Digital Interface. Sony and Philips were the primary designers of S/PDIF. S/PDIF is standardized in IEC 60958 as IEC 60958 type II (IEC 958 before 1998).|$|E
40|$|While face {{animation}} {{is still}} {{considered one of the}} toughest tasks in computer animation, its potential application range is rapidly moving from the classical field of film production into games, communications, news delivery and commerce. To support such novel applications, it is important to enable production and delivery of face animation {{on a wide range of}} platforms, from high-end animation systems to the web, game consoles and mobile phones. Our goal is to offer a framework of tools <b>interconnected</b> by standard <b>formats</b> and protocols and capable of supporting any imaginable application involving face animation with the desired level of animation quality, automatic production wherever it is possible, and delivery on a wide range of platforms. While this is clearly an ongoing task, we present the current state of development along with several case studies showing that a wide range of applications is already enabled...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a mechanism for}} automatic design and synthesis of very long instruction word (VLIW), and its generalization, explicitly parallel instruction computing specification of their desired functionality. The process of architecture design makes concrete decisions regarding the number and types of functional units, number of read/write ports on register files, the datapath <b>interconnect,</b> the in-struction <b>format,</b> its decoding hardware, and the instruction unit datapath. The processor design is then automatically synthesized into a detailed RTL-level structural model in VHDL along with an estimate of its area. The system also generates the corresponding detailed machine description and instruction format description {{that can be used}} to re-target a compiler and an assembler respectively. All this is part of an overall design system, called Program-In-Chip-Out (PICO), which has the ability to perform automatic ex-ploration of the architectural design space while customiz-ing the architecture to a given application and making in-telligent, quantitative, cost-performance tradeoffs. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosive}} {{growth of the}} traffic between data centers {{has led to an}} urgent demand for high-performance short-reach optical interconnects with data rate beyond 100 G per wavelength and transmission distance over hundreds of kilometers. Since direct detection (DD) provides a cost-efficient solution for short-reach interconnects, various advanced modulation formats have been intensively studied to improve the performance of DD for high-performance short-reach optical interconnects. In this paper, we report the recent progress on the advanced DD modulation formats that provide superior electrical spectral efficiency (SE) and transmission reach beyond that of simple direct modulation (DM) based direct detection (DM/DD). We first provide a review of the current advanced modulation formats for high-performance short-reach optical <b>interconnects.</b> Among these <b>formats,</b> Stokes vector direct detection (SV-DD) achieves the highest electrical spectrum efficiency, presenting itself as a promising candidate for future short-reach networks. We then expound some novel algorithms to achieve high-performance SV-DD systems under severe impairments of either polarization mode dispersion (PMD) or polarization dependent loss (PDL).

40|$|Commercially {{successful}} {{ideas in}} the creative world are often imitated or adapted. Television formats, in particular, are routinely copied. From early radio formats to game shows and reality programme formats of today, producers have accused others of “stealing”. Although formats constitute {{one of the most}} important exports for British TV producers, there is still no certainty about the legal protection of TV formats from copycat versions. Since TV formats fail to fall neatly within the definitions of protected material under international copyright and trade mark regimes, producers have been trying to devise innovative means to protect their formats from copycatting and plagiarism. Though the globalization of cultural and entertainment markets may itself have contributed to the rise of TV <b>formats,</b> <b>interconnecting</b> programming industries in a world of multiplying channels, this paper theorizes that global broadcasting and programme marketing strategies can also be used by TV format producers to protect their intellectual property rights. Specifically, eight different strategies may be used: (a) trade show infrastructure and dynamics; (b) visual brand identity and channel fit; (c) brand extension and merchandising; (d) corporate branding; (e) national branding; (f) genre branding; (g) constant brand innovation; (h) fan communities. The paper prepares the ground for evaluating the use and effectiveness of these eight strategies in preventing the copying of formats...|$|R
40|$|For {{concrete}} structures {{exposed to}} frost attack, cracks, or microcracks induced by freeze-thaw cycling can <b>format</b> <b>interconnecting</b> flow paths and allow more water or chloride ions to penetrate into the bulk concrete. It will subsequently facilitate further deterioration of concrete structures and accelerate the corrosion of embedded reinforced steel bars. Moreover, in reality most concrete structures are rarely fully saturated, so that chloride transportation in unsaturated concrete must be studied {{with respect to}} the water moving process in order to cover the real existing service conditions. In the current work, a numerical simulation method based on the mesoscale composite structure of concrete, named the lattice network model, is established to analyze the penetration property of concrete; especially the effects of microcracking induced by freeze-thaw damage on the unsaturated flow behavior are investigated. In the mesoscale model, concrete is treated as a three-phase composite material consisting of coarse aggregates, mortar matrix, and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the aggregate and the mortar matrix. The diffusivities of each phase, (i. e.,water and chloride diffusion coefficients) is separately characterized and quantified in terms of the published test results. The unsaturated flow theory for capillary water absorption and chloride transport is employed to simulate the ingress of water and chloride ions into concrete. It is found that the water absorption and chloride penetration are substantially influenced by the frost action, and the cumulative absorbed water and chloride penetration depth are increased with the increase of freezing-thawing cycles (FTCs). Furthermore, the numerical predictions about water absorption and chloride profiles are compared with the experimental measurements. The comparisons indicate that numerical predictions agree very well with the test data...|$|R
