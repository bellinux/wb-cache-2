50|$|Traditional smoke {{detectors}} are technically ionisation {{smoke detectors}} which create an electric current between two metal plates, which sound an alarm when disrupted by smoke entering the chamber. Ionisation smoke alarms can quickly detect the {{small amounts of}} smoke produced by fast-flaming fires, such as cooking fires or those fueled by paper or flammable liquids. A newer, and perhaps safer, type is a photoelectric smoke detector. It contains a light source in a light-sensitive <b>electric</b> <b>sensor,</b> which is positioned at a 90-degree angles to the sensor. Normally, light from the light source shoots straight across and misses the sensor. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the sensor and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors typically respond faster to a fire in its early, smoldering stage - before {{the source of the}} fire bursts into flames.|$|E

Serving in this capacity, these structures {{are subjected to}} impacts such as tool drops, hail, bird strikes, and runway debris. Unlike for their solid metallic counterparts, predictions {{of the effects of}} low-velocity impact damage are difficult and are still relatively immature. Sandwich panels in particular are sensitive to localized impact. For making a systematic study of impact on composite sandwich panels under these conditions, suitable equipment was designed and fabricated. This article describes the salient features of indigenously developed test equipment for testing localized, penetrating impact on sandwich panels. The size of the sandwich panels in question are 150 X 150 mm 2 with a typical thickness of 16 - 25 mm. The impact velocities are in the region 2 - 6 m/s, with an impactor mass between 2. 5 and 12. 5 kg, and two types of impactors were used: hemispherical impactor with diameter of 12. 5 mm and flat impactor of 25 x 25 mm. Using this equipment laminated composites, sandwich panels and polymer sheets can be tested to assess the resistance to falling weight in the low velocity region.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes several simple, robust, and non-intrusive {{condition monitoring}} methods for induction motors fed by closed-loop inverters and claw-pole generators with built-in rectifiers. While the flexible energy forms synthesized by power electronic converters greatly enhance {{the performance and}} expand the operating region of induction motors and claw-pole generators, they also significantly alter the fault behavior of these electric machines and complicate the fault detection and protection. In this dissertation, special characteristics of the connected closed-loop inverter and rectifier have been thoroughly analyzed, with particular interest in their impact on fault behaviors of the induction motor and the claw-pole generator. Based on the findings obtained from the theoretical and experimental analysis, several sensorless thermal, mechanical, and insulation monitoring methods are proposed by smartly utilizing special features and capabilities of the connected power electronic converter. A simple and sensitive stator turn-fault detector is proposed for induction motors fed by closed-loop inverter. In addition, a stator thermal monitoring method based on active DC current injection and direct voltage estimation is also proposed to prevent the closed-loop controlled induction motors from thermally overloading. The performance of both methods is demonstrated by extensive experimental results. Methods to detect serpentine belt slip, serpentine belt defect, rotor eccentricity have been proposed for claw-pole generators using only the available <b>electric</b> <b>sensor</b> information. Methods to detect and protect stator turn faults in claw-pole generators are also presented in this dissertation. Lastly, a novel method to detect the generalized bearing roughness fault is proposed.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the problem of impact on to {{composite}} materials this work has examined experimentally the characteristics of stress waves propagating through a multi layered plate due to a surface impact. Theoretical and numerical techniques {{have been developed for}} an impulsive line load acting on the upper surface of a four layer cross ply plate. These resolve the surface and inter lamina disturbances caused by the passing stress waves due to a normal line impulse onto a plate. The objective of this work was to examine the wave propagation in a cross ply plate with experimental techniques and compare the wave characteristics with the analytical predictions. To detect the passing of the stress waves on the surfaces and at the ply interfaces a piezo <b>electric</b> <b>sensor</b> was developed using polarized homopolymer of vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film. The responses collected from surfaces and mid plane of the impacted plate were dominated by the low frequency contribution of the impact, so the high frequency shear wave responses were extracted with digital filters. The experimental results presented show that when the limiting wave velocity in the plate was that of a Rayleigh type surface wave the largest disturbance in the plate occurred on the upper surface of the plate, and that when the limiting wave velocity in the plate was that in an internal shear wave and the largest disturbance occurred at the mid plane of the plate. These results demonstrated that {{the presence or absence of}} shear waves could be resolved experimentally at the surfaces and ply interfaces of a multi layered material.

40|$|The global {{electric}} power infrastructure {{is undergoing a}} dramatic transformation from a centralized, demand-following network to one that is more dynamic and consumer-interactive. This process requires {{a very large number}} of advanced sensors be deployed throughout the entire system. This manuscript documents the development of two enabling technologies for the realization of such large-scale monitoring networks. The first technology pertains to the idea of harvesting ambient energy to power wireless sensor nodes on overhead power lines such that these wireless sensors can be operated continuously without interruptions. A new type of piezoelectromagnetic (PEM) energy harvester is developed. The harvester is comprised of a bimorph piezoelectric cantilever with permanent magnets mounted on its tip. When placed near to an AC current source, the magnets couple to the AC magnetic field and excite the piezoelectric cantilever, which in turn generates a large electrical voltage output. The energy converted by the harvester is then rectified, stored and conditioned by a power conditioning circuit. The power is delivered to a wireless sensor platform at a regulated DC voltage. In this design, an enhanced magnetic coupling method is proposed and verified. A new closed-form lumped parameter model for the bimorph piezoelectric cantilever is devel- oped. The harvester is able to generate a raw power output of 500 &# 956;W when the device is placed 1 cm from the center of a 0. 75 inch conductor that carries a current of 20 A. At that level of power output, the device is able to allow a low-power wireless sensor node to collect and transmit measurement data to a remote device once every 10 seconds. The second research topic documented in this thesis is about non-intrusive electricity metering using remote energy sensing techniques. A stick-on energy metering system that can be easily installed on the surface of circuit breaker panels is developed. The system uses magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>sensor</b> to measure the electromagnetic field produced by the energized conductor in each individual circuit. A signal processing algorithm is invented to accurately reconstruct the current and voltage waveforms from the measurement data. The installation of such stick-on devices does not require the use of electricians.
