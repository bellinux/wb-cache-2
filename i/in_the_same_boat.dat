500|$|The {{location}} of {{the start of the}} race was moved to approximately [...] upstream of Putney Bridge in order to reduce interruptions to the race from steamers.

The effect may be very grand, but to make an otherwise logical reader accept the process must depend on giving him obscure reasons for wishing it so.
