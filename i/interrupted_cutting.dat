In some cases, fields of research are stagnating for its difficulty in material processing. In this study, we are particularly concerned about the cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp through modeling and simulations on wear rate of the tools. These simulations of tool wear rate and cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp are proved by cutting tests on Al/SiCp with nanocemented carbide tool WC- 7 Co and common cemented carbide tool YG 8. A detailed investigation suggests that the cutting instinct of Al/SiCp is of <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> process. And the grain loss, less tipping and blade fracture during tool wear results from high frequency intermittent shock by SiC grain. The wear behavior on the tool flank is mainly of grain loss. However, the wear behavior of the rake face is not only of grain loss, but also abrasive wear of WC grain by SiC grain. It is conclusively demonstrated that the model of tool wear rate is sufficient for revolution characterization of tool wear rate on grain size, volume fraction of reinforcement, and also significantly important to prove the <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> process mechanism of Al/SiCp...|$|E

This depression is {{mediated by the}} adrenal medullae, a propriospinal pathway between the afferent nociceptive input and preganglionic neurones projecting to the adrenal medullae, and a spino-bulbo-spinal pathway. Here we investigated the role of spinal ascending and descending pathways in the interaction between noxious and vagal afferent inputs, leading to inhibition of BK-induced PE mediated by the adrenal medullae. Nociceptors in the paw were activated by capsaicin and depression of BK-induced PE was measured in rats with intact or cut subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves. After cutting the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) contralateral to the stimulated hindpaw (segmental level C 5 /C 6 and T 8 /T 9), depression of BK-induced PE was weak or absent both in rats with intact vagus nerves and in vagotomised rats, suggesting that an ascending excitatory pathway was <b>interrupted.</b> After <b>cutting</b> the DLF ipsilateral to the stimulated hindpaw, depression of BK-induced PE was already markedly enhanced, {{even in the absence}} of vagotomy. Ipsilateral DLF lesion (L 2 /L 3) below the level of the spinal output to the adrenal medullae produced the same effect, suggesting interruption of a descending inhibitory pathway that relays the effect of vagal activity to the level of the capsaicin-induced nociceptive input. Contralateral and ipsilateral hemisection of the spinal cord (C 5 /C 6) produced the same changes as the corresponding DLF lesions. Ipsi- or contralateral lesion of the dorsal funiculus at the spinal level T 8 /T 9 had no effect on depression of BK-induced PE generated by cutaneous noxious stimulation of the forepaw. We suggest that noxious stimulation activates an ascending pathway of the spino-bulbo-spinal excitatory circuit which projects through the DLF contralateral to the nociceptive input, and that the inhibitory pathway which is activated by vagal afferent activity projects through the DLF ipsilateral to the nociceptive input...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{machining}} of hardened steel surfaces, turning instead of grinding has been employed increasingly due to several advantages it offers, such as flexibility {{and the possibility}} of dry cutting. The main tool materials used for this purpose are CBN and ceramic due to their high hardness and, in the case of some grades of these materials, high chemical stability with iron. However, when interrupted surfaces are turned, the tool requires not only these properties but also sufficient toughness to resist impacts against workpiece interruptions. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to compare CBN and ceramic tools in continuous and <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting.</b> To this end, several turning experiments were carried out on continuous surfaces (in this case, CBN with an added ceramic phase and a mixed ceramic were compared, due to their high chemical stability and hardness) and on interrupted surfaces (here, a high CBN content and a SiC-reinforced ceramic were compared due to their good ability to withstand impacts), applying different cutting speeds. The main conclusions of this work were that in both continuous and <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting,</b> the CBN tools exhibited a much better performance with respect to both tool life and workpiece surface roughness than the ceramic tools...|$|E

A {{detailed analysis of the}} real cutting process is performed with special respect to the geometrical defects of the part in order to highlight the source of machine tool vibrations. The analysis is completed by simple models to estimate the forced vibrations in interrupted turning, the gyroscopic effect, and the mode cou-pling using a new simplified formulation. Then, a new dy-namical model with <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> and geometrical inac-curacies—runout and orientation of eccentricity—is present-ed. Stability analysis of this model is performed by the semi-discretization method, an improved technique for analyzing delay-differential equations. The use of all these models on a given machining configuration allows comparing several vi-bration mechanisms. Thus, behavior’s specificities are highlighted, especially the influence of eccentricity runout on stability. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of the value and the orientation of the geometrical defects for low speed conditions.
