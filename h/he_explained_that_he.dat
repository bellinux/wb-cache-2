5|$|In an {{interview}} with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, Chambers revealed he would depart the serial {{at the conclusion of}} his contract in late 2017 due to a prior commitment. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be touring with a musical, which disappointed show bosses, but would return to the show {{at the conclusion of the}} tour.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen {{said in an interview that}} she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, when the Hayden Planetarium was {{undergoing}} a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused {{to refer to}} Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children. In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion of Pluto.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{declined}} {{offers to}} perform in the 1970s; <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not like to}} travel, and that the requirement for a career-minded musician to play concerts was not something that he wanted to follow. He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, Descent into the Maelstrom, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Lindsay Buroker [...] <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> started his publishing as a self-published author at podiobooks in 2007, but after quite some pressure he signed up with Ridan Publishing to get his books published.|$|R

5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
50|$|Outside, Sean shows Mickey {{a sizable}} wad of money. Seeing his brother's confusion, <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> bet {{everything}} on Elam, not Cullen. Mickey says Sean cheated, and Cullen was their only friend. Sean disagrees; money is his only friend.|$|R
50|$|Ruslan {{comes to}} rest at a stream and is {{met by a}} fisherman, who {{turns out to be}} the Khan Ratmir. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has met his true love and no longer yearns for Ludmila. The two part as friends.|$|R
25|$|Lycidas recites how sad he {{is without}} Phyllis, and how happy {{he will be}} if she returns to him. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{superior}} to Mopsus in musical skill, looks and wealth. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cannot work without Phyllis. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that,</b> if Phyllis is afraid <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might beat her, he shall have his hands bound (and reminds her {{of a time when}} Mopsus' own hands were bound, after he was caught thieving). He tells of the gifts of flowers he used to bring to Phyllis, and further mocks Mopsus. He threatens to hang himself if Phyllis does not return to him, and that a poem will be inscribed upon the tree from which he is hanged, telling of the affair.|$|R
5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would run for Speaker if he could be {{guaranteed}} {{an overwhelming majority of}} the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks {{of the year in}} Albania, there was no {{fighting}} since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Krujë was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By November 22, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow {{to come to terms with}} Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and referred to him as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was waiting to see what Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in order not to waste funds.|$|E
25|$|According to Thomas in an {{interview}} with ESPN, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was so quiet about his hospitalization because he was focused on his family at the time.|$|E
50|$|Kevin {{tries to}} get Angela into bed, but she resists and confronts him about his real reasons for asking her out. When <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> really does like her now, she points out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should have {{respected}} her from the start.|$|R
50|$|Act I {{ends with}} a {{monologue}} from old Arthur in which <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is sure, although {{he does not know}} how, <b>that</b> the sounds <b>he</b> heard were from neither Keckwick nor any living thing, but from things that are dead.|$|R
50|$|Bangkok Hilton {{begins as}} Hal Stanton (Denholm Elliott) leaves Bangkok by {{ship in the}} present day. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been {{travelling}} for years, since a shameful incident {{when he was a}} prisoner of the Japanese right there in Bangkok in WWII.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the {{war years}} and beyond, Sousa Mendes was optimistic that his {{punishment}} would be reversed and his deed would be recognized. In a 1945 letter to the Portuguese Parliament, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had disobeyed orders because he had considered them to be unconstitutional as the Portuguese Constitution forbade {{discrimination on the basis}} of religion. This was the first time that Sousa Mendes used this line of argument and <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hadn’t used it before because, being a public official, he did not want to attract publicity and therefore compromise Portugal’s neutrality.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, Father Jessing wrote {{a letter}} to Bishop Rosecrans asking {{permission}} to bring his newspaper and the orphan's asylum to a larger city. In that letter, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed to be closer to the railroad in order to distribute his paper. Since he wanted the work to be self-sustaining, he also discussed an industrial school that he wanted to start in connection with the orphan's asylum where boys could learn a trade to support themselves as adults.|$|E
25|$|The band {{received}} another tribute in {{the following}} year {{in the form of a}} star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. All the original members of the group attended the inauguration ceremony, and in his speech Maurice White attributed EWF's success to the support of all of their fans. In 1994, White retired from touring with the band. At the time, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to take a rest from the rigors of the road. Philip Bailey was given the role of onstage leader of the band.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} from France he had {{invested}} in a scheme, or perhaps scam, for gold-mining in Scotland, which he still remembered bitterly twenty-five years later. During a low point in his finances, in July 1601 Nicholas wrote to the Secretary of State Robert Cecil acknowledging the annuity of £40, but asking permission to retire from London and live more cheaply in the countryside. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had trained apprentices who now competed {{with him in the}} private painting market. Hilliard asked that Cecil employ his son as a clerk, because he could not keep him in his own trade.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{said that}} he was not {{concerned}} or focused on the events in Lucky's life while he was gone, stating: “You can't act information and you can't act history (...) That's what happened and that's what he's gone through, and that's that.” Jackson felt {{the heart and soul of}} the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|In {{his letter}} to David Ben-Gurion dated 9 January 1968, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{convinced}} that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking possession of Jerusalem, and Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. He felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during the occupation and that it amounted to annexation. He said that provided Israel withdrew its forces, it appeared {{that it might be}} possible to reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbours, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.|$|E
