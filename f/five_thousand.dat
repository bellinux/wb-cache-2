5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E

5|$|The {{underpinnings}} {{of the local}} economy are based on Moncton's heritage as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre.

5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> years ago, and man had been {{harvesting}} honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} {{remained}} new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism.

Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. By 2001 the population of North Uist was only 1,271.|$|E

There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen.|$|E
5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost <b>five</b> <b>thousand</b> images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
