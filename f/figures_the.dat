5|$|Across {{the top of}} {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 on the other Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of <b>figures,</b> <b>the</b> subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E

25|$|In 1980-1981, Alain Tranoy, reassessing Leite de Vasconcelos' {{original}} hypothesis, {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> left <b>figure</b> on <b>the</b> idol was the divinty, while <b>the</b> enclosed <b>figure</b> <b>the</b> practitioner/devotee. Later, António Rodríguez Colmenero defended that the fountain {{was part of}} plural sanctuary, and <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> represented <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> of Nabia and Tongo Nabiago.|$|R
5|$|Another form of {{the goddess}} in the Tantrasara {{describes}} her seated in her own navel, formless and invisible. This form {{is said to be}} realised only via a trance. Another aniconic representation of the goddess is her yantra (a mystical geometrical diagram used in Tantric rituals), which <b>figures</b> <b>the</b> inverted triangle and lotus found in her iconography.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Dalton orally {{presented}} his first list of relative atomic weights {{for a number}} of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} were also named after historical <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> name of Claus Valca's father {{was derived from}} Hamilcar Barca, the leading commander of Carthaginian forces during the First Punic War and father of the talented tactician Hannibal. An Anatoray general was named after Vitellius, who led the Roman Empire for several months during the Year of the Four Emperors.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath {{went through}} the season unbeaten at Coventry Road. In the League, they scored 90 goals, {{at a rate of}} more than 4 goals per game, and all five first-choice {{forwards}} reached double <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> leading scorer was Fred Wheldon, with 25 goals from the 22 League fixtures and 1 in the test match, a total which made him the top scorer for the Second Division. Wheldon, Tommy Hands and Billy Ollis were ever-present in the League, and Caesar Jenkyns and Jack Hallam missed only one game apiece.|$|E
5|$|The Dominican quadrille {{generally}} has four <b>figures,</b> <b>the</b> pastouwèl, lapoul, lété and latrinitez. Some regions of Dominica, such as Petite Savanne, {{are home to}} local variants such as the caristo. Many quadrilles are found across Dominica under {{a wide variety of}} names. In addition to the standard quadrille, the lancer is also an important Dominican dance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>figures,</b> <b>the</b> {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Our Friends in the North gained 5.1 million viewers on its {{original}} transmission, {{and the first}} six episodes each gained between 4.5 and 5.5 million viewers.

5|$|The {{painting}} was completed early in van der Weyden's career, probably just after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended. Although highly accomplished, it {{is filled with}} symbolism of a kind absent from his more mature works. It is one of three attributed paintings, all early works, that show the Virgin and Child set within an architectural setting, surrounded with painted sculptural <b>figures,</b> <b>the</b> others being The Madonna Standing and the Durán Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of characters from Dark Forces resulted in LucasArts licensing toys {{based on the}} game. Hasbro produced Kyle Katarn and Dark Trooper toys, which are among the Star Wars expanded universe items to be turned into action <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> Dark Troopers were also included in books and comics. William C. Dietz's novelizations of the Dark Forces storyline were adapted to full-cast audio dramatizations.|$|E

5|$|The punchbowls are of polychrome famille {{rose with}} gilding, adorned with {{panoramic}} views from opposite vantage points of early 19th century Sydney, combined with traditional Chinese porcelain decorations and each features a rare, lively tondo grouping of Aboriginal <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> panoramas are detailed and show {{a number of}} landmarks in and around Sidney Cove at the time. The motifs have probably been taken from artwork by several artists working in Australia during the 18th and early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} one of the private {{chambers}} on the upper floor were covered with 16th century limewash which was removed in 1995, to expose a 13th-century wall painting with a depiction of Jesus on the cross and two other <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> crucifixion scene with rosettes and vine leaf decoration was uncovered in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as {{he also did}} in his paintings of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of paint {{to which he was}} more accustomed.|$|E

5|$|A 1998 {{estimate}} {{suggests the}} total annual worldwide consumption of Boletus edulis and {{closely related species}} (B.aereus, B.pinophilus, and B.reticulatus) to be between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it {{does not account for}} informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the wholesale price to over $200 per kilogram.|$|E
5|$|A {{nobelium}} atom has 102 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f147s2 (ground state term symbol 1S0), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, all the three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f13 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. Nevertheless, {{it is more likely that}} only two valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a stable 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell. The first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most (6.65±0.07)eV in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate and octacoordinate No3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102pm respectively; the ionic radius of No2+ has been experimentally found to be 100pm to two significant <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> enthalpy of hydration of No2+ has been calculated as 1486kJ·mol−1.|$|E
