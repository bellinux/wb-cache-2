This article proposes a novel method for a generalized inverse dynamics based fuzzy logic controller (FLC) of a single-link flexible manipulator. The deflection of the flexible link was modeled using the assumed modes method. The control action is distributed between two FLCs: A joint angle controller and a tip controller. Each controller produces a torque value. The torque values are summed, and the resulting control action is used to drive the manipulator. A novel method for varying the ranges of the variables of the two controllers {{as a function of the}} motion parameters and the inverse dynamics of the system is presented.

The activity of the error-detecting neurons encodes the discrepancy (or residual error) between the expected inputs (reconstructed from the predictions) and the actual inputs.
