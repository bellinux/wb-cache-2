5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} which uses <b>holography</b> to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, {{it is used to}} perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.|$|E
5|$|The third method, time-average <b>holography,</b> {{involves}} {{creating a}} holograph while {{the object is}} subjected to a periodic stress or vibration. This yields a visual image of the vibration pattern.|$|E
5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} <b>holography</b> is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E
5|$|Electron <b>holography</b> is an imaging {{technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional {{imaging technique}}s. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV <b>holography,</b> uses video detection and recording to produce {{an image of the}} object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig.21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Real-time <b>holography</b> is {{a second}} method of {{creating}} holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, <b>holography,</b> machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
25|$|Specular <b>holography</b> uses a {{large number}} of curved mirrors {{embedded}} in a surface to produce three-dimensional imagery.|$|E
25|$|Uses {{which may}} {{make use of}} the {{coherence}} of diode-laser-generated light include interferometric distance measurement, <b>holography,</b> coherent communications, and coherent control of chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|Atomic mirrors are devices which reflect matter waves. Usually, atomic mirrors work at grazing incidence. Such mirrors can be {{used for}} atomic {{interferometry}} and atomic <b>holography.</b> It has been proposed that they {{can be used}} for non-destructive imaging systems with nanometer resolution.|$|E
25|$|For {{practical}} applications, gratings {{generally have}} ridges or rulings on their surface rather than dark lines. Such gratings {{can be either}} transmissive or reflective. Gratings which modulate the phase rather than the amplitude of the incident light are also produced, frequently using <b>holography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor {{technology}} {{today is}} also utilized to etch holographically patterned gratings into robust {{materials such as}} fused silica. In this way, low stray-light <b>holography</b> is combined with the high efficiency of deep, etched transmission gratings, and {{can be incorporated into}} high volume, low cost semiconductor manufacturing technology.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, Talbot {{discovered}} that gelatine treated with potassium dichromate, a sensitiser introduced by Mungo Ponton in 1839, is made less soluble {{by exposure to}} light. This later {{provided the basis for}} the important carbon printing process and related technologies. Dichromated gelatine is still used for some laser <b>holography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rugby is a {{birthplace of}} the jet engine. In April 1937 Frank Whittle built the world's first {{prototype}} jet engine at the British Thomson-Houston works in Rugby, and between 1936-41 based himself at Brownsover Hall on the outskirts, where he designed and developed early prototype engines. Much of his work was carried out at nearby Lutterworth. <b>Holography</b> was invented in Rugby by the Hungarian inventor Dennis Gabor in 1947.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In <b>holography,</b> the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because <b>holography</b> requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, it was {{reported}} that exposing a thin film of azo-polymer to a light intensity (or polarization) gradient leads to spontaneous surface patterns. In essence, the polymer material will reversibly deform so as to minimize the amount of material exposed to the light. This phenomenon is not laser ablation, since it readily occurs at low power and the transformation is reversible. The mechanism of this surface <b>holography</b> seems related to a new photomechanical effect, involving azobenzene isomerization.|$|E
25|$|Karl Pribram's holonomic brain theory (quantum <b>holography)</b> invoked quantum {{mechanics}} to explain higher order processing by the mind. He argued that his holonomic model solved the binding problem. Pribram collaborated with Bohm {{in his work}} on the quantum approaches to mind and he provided evidence on how much of the processing in the brain was done in wholes. He proposed that ordered water at dendritic membrane surfaces might operate by structuring Bose-Einstein condensation supporting quantum dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The Russian physics school {{began with}} Lomonosov who {{proposed}} {{the law of}} conservation of matter preceding the energy conservation law. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the electric arc, electrodynamical Lenz's law, space groups of crystals, photoelectric cell, superfluidity, Cherenkov radiation, electron paramagnetic resonance, heterotransistors and 3D <b>holography.</b> Lasers and masers were co-invented by Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov, while the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion was introduced by Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Artsimovich, leading eventually the modern international ITER project, where Russia is a party.|$|E
25|$|In {{a larger}} sense, the theory {{suggests}} that the entire universe {{can be seen as}} two-dimensional information on the cosmological horizon, the event horizon from which information may still be gathered and not lost due to the natural limitations of spacetime supporting a black hole, an observer and a given setting of these specific elements, such that the three dimensions we observe are an effective description only at macroscopic scales and at low energies. Cosmological <b>holography</b> has not been made mathematically precise, partly because the particle horizon has a non-zero area and grows with time.|$|E
25|$|This {{idea was}} made more precise by Leonard Susskind, {{who had also}} been {{developing}} <b>holography,</b> largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon {{of a black hole}} is a complete description of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the blue}} region of the spectrum became widely {{available to the public}} in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality. Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for <b>holography,</b> DNA sequencing, optical pumping, and other scientific and medical applications.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November 2016 Erik Verlinde {{published}} his new theory of gravity. In this work, {{he argues that}} unlike in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, <b>holography</b> and the area law do not apply exactly in de Sitter space (which models our universe) because there is an additional entropy associated with the cosmological horizon. If this entropy were evenly distributed throughout space, it would contribute a volume law term to the entropy which becomes dominant at large length scales and is related to dark energy. He further argues that this entropy modifies emergent gravity, introducing residual forces when the acceleration due to gravity is very weak.|$|E
25|$|In a TEM, {{a single}} crystal grain or {{particle}} may be {{selected for the}} diffraction experiments. This means that the diffraction experiments can be performed on single crystals of nanometer size, whereas other diffraction techniques {{would be limited to}} studying the diffraction from a multicrystalline or powder sample. Furthermore, electron diffraction in TEM can be combined with direct imaging of the sample, including high resolution imaging of the crystal lattice, and a range of other techniques. These include solving and refining crystal structures by electron crystallography, chemical analysis of the sample composition through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, investigations of electronic structure and bonding through electron energy loss spectroscopy, and studies of the mean inner potential through electron <b>holography.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glass {{plates were}} the medium for most {{original}} camera photography {{from the late}} 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as astrophotography, continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser <b>holography,</b> it has persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|Lex Luthor has the {{physical}} capabilities {{and limitations of}} a normal adult with no metahuman abilities. However, he possesses a genius level of intelligence and eidetic memory. For virtually his entire publication history, he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the DC Universe, and {{as one of the}} most intelligent beings of any planet or species. He has mastered seemingly every known form of science, including space travel, extra-dimensional travel, biochemistry, robotics, computers, synthetic polymers, communications, mutations, transportation, <b>holography,</b> energy generation, spectral analysis, and more (including time travel). With the exception of the extraterrestrial entity known as Brainiac, he does not view any other being as an intellectual peer.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Susskind, {{along with}} {{collaborators}} Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, and Stephen Shenker, presented a {{formulation of the}} new M-theory using a holographic description in terms of charged point black holes, the D0 branes of type IIA string theory. The matrix theory they proposed was first suggested as a description of two branes in 11-dimensional supergravity by Bernard de Wit, Jens Hoppe, and Hermann Nicolai. The later authors reinterpreted the same matrix models as {{a description of the}} dynamics of point black holes in particular limits. <b>Holography</b> allowed them to conclude that the dynamics of these black holes give a complete non-perturbative formulation of M-theory. In 1997, Juan Maldacena gave the first holographic descriptions of a higher-dimensional object, the 3+1-dimensional type IIB membrane, which resolved a long-standing problem of finding a string description which describes a gauge theory. These developments simultaneously explained how string theory is related to some forms of supersymmetric quantum field theories.|$|E
500|$|Another samarium-based laser {{became the}} first {{saturated}} X-ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It provided 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8nm suitable for applications in <b>holography,</b> high-resolution microscopy of biological specimens, deflectometry, interferometry, and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared [...] (wavelength ~1.05µm).|$|E
2500|$|Helioseismic <b>holography,</b> {{introduced}} in detail by Lindsey and Braun {{for the purpose}} of far-side (magnetic) imaging, a special case of phase-sensitive <b>holography.</b> The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions {{on the far side of}} the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic <b>holography</b> is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, <b>holography</b> is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare. Acoustic <b>holography,</b> applied to MDI data, is ideal for the detection of sources and sinks of acoustic waves on the Sun. Braun and Fan [...] discovered a region of lower acoustic emission in the 3 – 4 mHz frequency band which extends far beyond the sunspots (the ‘acoustic moat’). Acoustic moats extend beyond magnetic regions into the quiet Sun. In addition, Braun and Lindsey [...] discovered high-frequency emission (‘acoustic glories’) surrounding active regions.|$|E

2500|$|More {{recently}} (circa 1997), Bandler has claimed, [...] "NLP {{is based}} on finding out what works and formalizing it.

2500|$|In-line <b>holography</b> {{is another}} {{approach}} that provides some unique advantages for particle imaging. Perhaps {{the largest of}} these is the use of forward scattered light, which is orders of magnitude brighter than scattering oriented normal to the beam direction. Additionally, the optical setup of such systems is much simpler because the residual light {{does not need to be}} separated and recombined at a different location. The in-line configuration also provides a relatively easy extension to apply CCD sensors, creating a separate class of experiments known as digital in-line <b>holography.</b> The complexity of such setups shifts from the optical setup to image post-processing, which involves the use of simulated reference beams.

2500|$|A new {{technology}} for grating insertion into integrated photonic lightwave circuits is digital planar <b>holography</b> (DPH). DPH gratings are generated in computer and fabricated {{on one or}} several interfaces of an optical waveguide planar with standard micro-lithography or nano-imprinting methods, compatible with mass-production. [...] Light propagates inside the DPH gratings, confined by the refractive index gradient, which provides longer interaction path and greater flexibility in light steering.|$|E
2500|$|The propagation-based imaging {{technique}} was primarily {{introduced by the}} group of Anatoly Snigirev at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) in Grenoble, France, and {{was based on the}} detection of [...] "Fresnel fringes" [...] that arise under certain circumstances in free-space propagation. The experimental setup consisted of an inline configuration of an X-ray source, a sample and a detector and did not require any optical elements. It was conceptually identical to the setup of Dennis Gabor's revolutionary work on <b>holography</b> in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Propagation-based imaging (PBI) is {{the most}} common name for this {{technique}} but it is also called [...] in-line <b>holography,</b> refraction-enhanced imaging [...] or phase-contrast radiography. The latter denomination derives {{from the fact that the}} experimental setup of this method is basically the same as in conventional radiography. It consists of an in-line arrangement of an X-ray source, the sample and an X-ray detector and no other optical elements are required. The only difference is that the detector is not placed immediately behind the sample, but in some distance, so the radiation refracted by the sample can interfere with the unchanged beam.|$|E
