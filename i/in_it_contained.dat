60|$|First, then: If {{that country}} was {{in need of}} a {{territorial}} organization, could it not have had it as well without as with a repeal? Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without its repeal, each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the year before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the repealing clause, and this {{in the hands of the}} same men who are now the champions of repeal. Why no necessity then for repeal? But still later, when this very bill was first brought <b>in,</b> <b>it</b> <b>contained</b> no repeal. But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather commanded, the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur.|$|E
6000|$|A {{long time}} ago I formed a small {{collection}} of children's [...] books of {{the early years of}} the nineteenth century; [...] and looking through them, wishing that some of [...] them had fallen into my hands when I was a child I [...] recalled the books I had read at that time--especially [...] two or three. Like any normal child I delighted in [...] such stories as the Swiss Family Robinson, but they [...] were not the books I prized most; they omitted the very [...] quality I liked best--the little thrills that nature itself [...] gave me, which half frightened and fascinated at the [...] same time, the wonder and mystery of it all. Once in a [...] while I got a book with something of this rare element [...] <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> <b>contained</b> perhaps in some perfectly absurd [...] narrative of animals taking human shape or using human [...] speech, with such like transformations and vagaries; [...] they could never be too extravagant, fantastic and incredible, [...] so long as they expressed anything of the feeling [...] I myself experienced when out of sight and sound [...] of my fellow beings, whether out on the great level [...] plain, with a glitter of illusory water all round me, or [...] among the shadowy trees with their bird and insect [...] sounds, or by the waterside and bed of tall dark bullrushes [...] murmuring in the wind.|$|E
6000|$|The coronation, {{when the}} time arrived for it, was very splendid. The queen went in state in a sumptuous chariot, preceded by {{trumpeters}} and heralds in armor, and accompanied by a long train of noblemen, barons, and gentlemen, and also of ladies, all most richly dressed in crimson velvet, the trappings of the horses being of the same material. The people of London thronged all the streets through which she was to pass, and made the air resound with shouts and acclamations. There were triumphal arches erected here and there on the way, with {{a great variety of}} odd and quaint devices, and a child stationed upon each, who explained the devices to Elizabeth as she passed, in English verse, written for the occasion. One of these pageants was entitled [...] "The Seat of worthy Governance." [...] There was a throne, supported by figures which represented the cardinal virtues, such as Piety, Wisdom, Temperance, Industry, Truth, and beneath their feet were the opposite vices, Superstition, Ignorance, Intemperance, Idleness, and Falsehood: these the virtues were trampling upon. On the throne was a representation of Elizabeth. At one place were eight personages dressed to represent the eight beatitudes pronounced by our Savior in his sermon on the Mount--the meek, the merciful, &c. Each of these qualities was ingeniously ascribed to Elizabeth. This could be done with much more propriety then than in subsequent years. In another place, an ancient figure, representing Time, came out of a cave which had been artificially constructed with great ingenuity, leading his daughter, whose name was Truth. Truth had an English Bible in her hands, which she presented to Elizabeth as she passed. This {{had a great deal of}} meaning; for the Catholic government of Mary had discouraged the circulation of the Scriptures in the vernacular tongue. When the procession arrived in the middle of the city, some officers of the city government approached the queen's chariot, and delivered to her a present of a very large and heavy purse filled with gold. The queen had to employ both hands in lifting it <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> <b>contained</b> an amount equal in value to two or three thousand dollars.|$|E

60|$|The inner tomb {{was found}} without any earth in it, {{just as it}} had been left when the last old Roman was buried there; and it being only a week or two since it was opened, there was very little {{intervention}} of persons, though much of time, between the departure of the friends of the dead and our own visit. It is a square room, with a mosaic pavement, and is six or seven paces in length and breadth, and as much in height to the vaulted roof. The roof and upper walls are beautifully ornamented with frescos, which were very bright when first discovered, but have rapidly faded since the admission of the air, though the graceful and joyous designs, flowers and fruits and trees, are still perfectly discernible. The room must have been anything but sad and funereal; on the contrary, as cheerful a saloon, and as brilliant, if lighted up, as one could desire to feast <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> <b>contained</b> several marble sarcophagi, covering indeed almost the whole floor, and each of them as much as three or four feet in length, and two much longer. The longer ones I did not particularly examine, and they seemed comparatively plainer; but the smaller sarcophagi were covered with the most delicately wrought and beautiful bas-reliefs that I ever beheld; a throng of glad and lovely shapes in marble clustering thickly and chasing one another round the sides of these old stone coffins. The work was as perfect as when the sculptor gave it his last touch; and if he had wrought it to be placed in a frequented hall, to be seen and admired by continual crowds as long as the marble should endure, he could not have chiselled with better skill and care, though his work was to be shut up in the depths of a tomb forever. This seems to me the strangest thing in the world, the most alien from modern sympathies. If they had built their tombs above ground, one could understand the arrangement better; but no sooner had they adorned them so richly, and furnished them with such exquisite productions of art, than they annihilated them with darkness. It was an attempt, no doubt, to render the physical aspect of death cheerful, but there was no good sense in it.|$|E

Some of the women elected to prepare their own personal favorite recipes, as Meghan and Amanda cooked a stuffed pepper dish instead; Erica made a chicken casserole. After the women prepared the meals, the sons and chef judged each of the meals. The winners were Amanda, Meghan, Julie, and Erica, who were exempted from having their files opened in this episode.|$|E

50|$|The great {{push toward}} the modern concept of {{explanation}} started with Galileo, {{one of the}} few physicists who was both a consummate theoretician and a great experimentalist. The analytic geometry and mechanics of Descartes were incorporated into the calculus and mechanics of Isaac Newton, another theoretician/experimentalist of the highest order, writing Principia Mathematica. <b>In</b> <b>it</b> <b>contained</b> a grand synthesis of the work of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler; as well as Newton's theories of mechanics and gravitation, which held sway as worldviews until the early 20th century. Simultaneously, progress was also made in optics (in particular colour theory and the ancient science of geometrical optics), courtesy of Newton, Descartes and the Dutchmen Snell and Huygens. In the 18th and 19th centuries Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Euler and William Rowan Hamilton would extend the theory of classical mechanics considerably. They picked up the interactive intertwining of mathematics and physics begun two millennia earlier by Pythagoras.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001, Plaza de La Raza {{would include}} Antón’s imagery in their touring {{presentation}} of “Hecho en Califas: The Last Decade”. This exhibition was curated {{by the artist}} and educator Richard Lou and coordinated by Rebecca Nevarez. In the accompanying catalog, Lou’s essay, “The Secularization of the Chicano Visual Idiom: Diversifying the Iconography” Antón is quoted, “Art for me {{are the things that}} were kept next to your Santos in your house, they were the pictures that meant the most; the galleries that are the most significant are the ones that we keep in our back pockets.”A major retrospective of his work entitled, “The Total Sum of Solitudes: Thirty Years of Photography by Don Gregorio Antón” was presented at Humboldt State University’s First Street Gallery in 2004. Accompanying this exhibition was a survey of Antón’s former and current students titled, “From Whom I’ve Studied, From Whom I’ve Learned”. In the corresponding brochure, intern Cyrus Smith writes, “These pieces, as in all of Antón’s work in photography and in teaching, are, above all, gifts. They bring the gift of opportunity. He does not offer you what to learn, but rather how to learn. He does not simply show you a photograph, he allows you to enter into it. In doing so, Don Antón’s photographs offer us the opportunity to see the richness and undeniable power of hope.”In 2006, Antón’s Artist-in-residence at Light Work would lead to the exhibition and catalog “Ollin Mecatl: The Measure of Movements”, curated and authored by the Executive Director and photographer Hannah Freiser. Fine Arts Critic and former Director of the Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center, Katherine Rushworth would name it, [...] "One of the most elegant shows of the year." [...] <b>In</b> <b>it</b> <b>contained</b> his acclaimed RETABLOS series, intimately small imagery on copper plates that harken to religious iconography often found in colonial churches. This style of devotional paintings were first experienced by Antón when he was an altar boy at Saint Francis Xavier church in Pico Rivera. It was his obligation to clean around the saints where many of these Ex Votos were dedicated to various saints by members of the church. In them stories of gratitude and divine intervention were written and illustrated. Upon his own creation Antón inscribes, “I know what howls in the night [...] [...] [...] not the screams of demons [...] [...] [...] No, it is the sound of longing that breaks upon the rock & bone, against light sliced by endless night. I have been dragged through all of this, down every dark path, past every senseless act, over every stone that twists & turns the spine & curves the soul.” ...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho de pesquisa teve como objetivo analisar o discurso dos Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais - Ensino Fundamental - 3 ° e 4 ° ciclos. Para tanto, discorreu sobre a trajetória do discurso oficial para o ensino da disciplina Língua Portuguesa, focalizando seu contexto histórico de produção, bem como todas as reformas curriculares que antecederam o objeto de análise; analisou o discurso do documento tendo por base as idéias de Bakhtin sobre polifonia e monofonia, levantando as dificuldades de aplicação das propostas nele contidas. Foi feita uma pesquisa de base qualitativa, etnográfica, focalizando o processo pedagógico desenvolvido em sala de aula por vinte e quatro professores atuantes em nove escolas estaduais pertencentes à Diretoria de Ensino da Região de Ourinhos - SP, desde a formulação dos Planos Anuais de Ensino até o resultado visto em sala de aula, por meio das anotações feitas pelos alunos, com a preocupação de perceber a relação existente com os PCN-LP, além de entrevistas com alunos concluintes dos cursos de Letras que formam os futuros professores que atuarão na região. O que motivou a pesquisa foi a inquietação de quem atua dentro da escola e percebe que a qualidade do ensino de língua materna não consegue se efetivar com sucesso. Daí, o interesse em estudar as determinações oficiais e descobrir os nós que atravancam a execução das propostas elaboradas por intelectuais respeitados e que não chegam aos seus sujeitos de direito, alunos e professores. Tentou-se mostrar e avalizar novos direcionamentos que pudessem intervir e {{reverter}} o estado caótico em que se encontra o ensino de Língua Portuguesa, no país. Foi intenção da pesquisa deixar uma contribuição aos atuais e futuros professores, além dos dirigentes educacionais, para se procurar caminhos para a efetiva realização do processo ensino-apendizagem da disciplina em questão.

What motivated the research was the inquietude of who acts inside of school and perceives that the quality of the teaching of mother language does not obtain to accomplish itself successfully. That's why the interest in studying the official determinations and to find out the knots that hinder the execution of the proposals elaborated by respected intellectuals and don't achieve its citizens of right pupils and teachers.
