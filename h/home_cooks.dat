Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by <b>home</b> <b>cooks.</b> They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reported {{associations}} between preparing and eating <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> food, and both diet and health, are inconsistent. Most {{previous research has}} focused on preparing, rather than eating, <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> food; used small, non-population based samples; and studied markers of nutrient intake, rather than overall diet quality or health. We aimed to assess whether frequency of consuming <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals was cross-sectionally associated with diet quality and cardio-metabolic health. Methods We used baseline data from a United Kingdom population-based cohort study of adults aged 29 to 64  years (n =  11, 396). Participants self-reported frequency of consuming <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> main meals. Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, fruit and vegetable intake calculated from a 130 -item food frequency questionnaire, and plasma vitamin C. Markers of cardio-metabolic health were researcher-measured body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), cholesterol and hypertension. Differences across the three exposure categories were assessed using linear regression (diet variables) and logistic regression (health variables). Results Eating <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals more frequently was associated with greater adherence to DASH and Mediterranean diets, greater fruit and vegetable intakes and higher plasma vitamin C, in adjusted models. Those eating <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, consumed 62. 3  g more fruit (99 % CI 43. 2 to 81. 5) and 97. 8  g more vegetables (99 % CI 84. 4 to 111. 2) daily. More frequent consumption of <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals was associated with greater likelihood of having normal range BMI and normal percentage body fat. Associations with HbA 1 c, cholesterol and hypertension were not significant in adjusted models. Those consuming <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, were 28 % less likely to have overweight BMI (99 % CI 8 to 43 %), and 24 % less likely to have excess percentage body fat (99 % CI 5 to 40 %). Conclusions In a large population-based cohort study, eating <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals more frequently was associated with better dietary quality and lower adiposity. Further prospective research is required to identify whether consumption of <b>home</b> <b>cooked</b> meals has causal effects on diet and health...|$|R

5|$|French cuisine was codified in the 20th {{century by}} Auguste Escoffier {{to become the}} modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary {{character}} {{to be found in}} the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by <b>home</b> <b>cooks.</b> Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.|$|E

25|$|In modern times, {{a common}} method for {{producing}} ice cream {{at home is}} to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for <b>home</b> <b>cooks,</b> is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method {{is to use a}} pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.|$|E
25|$|When {{designing}} the museum, the Smithsonian utilized its experience with Mitsitam Café at the National Museum of the American Indian. That cafeteria {{had been established}} to familiarize museum-goers with the rich food heritage of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Mitsitam Café not only proved popular and won culinary awards, but made {{a substantial amount of}} profit. The idea of regional food stations came from Dr. Jessica B. Harris, a food scholar who researched the food of African Americans from the colonial era to the present and presented her research to the museum's scholarly committee in 2013. Albert Lukas, a supervising chef at Sweet Home Café, traveled the United States for two years to find recipes and interview <b>home</b> <b>cooks</b> and professional chefs. A committee of chefs, curators, and historians spent another two years working out the restaurant's concept, visual design, and menu (the latter of which was designed by executive chef Grant). The final menu was designed not only to showcase the kinds of food African Americans of different regions ate at different times in American history, but also to demonstrate the impact African Americans had on both home cooking and haute cuisine.|$|E

[...] Prior to The Bacon Cookbook, Villas had written other cookbooks {{including}} The Glory of Southern Cooking, My Mother's Southern Kitchen, and Biscuit Bliss. The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and <b>home</b> <b>cooks</b> add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store. I mean quality bacon. And America really should be out there searching for this stuff. And it'll change your life. It will really change your life." ...|$|E
