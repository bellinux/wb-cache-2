25|$|Moon-landing conspiracists focus {{heavily on}} NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films {{taken on the}} Moon. Photography experts (including those {{unrelated}} to NASA) answer that the oddities are what one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> real Moon landing, and not what would happen with tweaked or studio imagery. Some of the main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Michael Fitzgerald {{disputes}} {{the claim of}} schizophrenia, saying that Wain more likely had Asperger's syndrome (AS). Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, as one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual agnosia are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual agnosia, it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
25|$|While at {{that stage}} not a union, the British Association of Social Workers {{operated}} a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations {{provide the kind of}} representation you would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Brixtofte made {{headlines}} {{with a highly}} untraditional sale-and-lease-back model where the municipality sold buildings and facilities to private companies and rented them back. Due to various national tax issues this was highly advantageous for both parties. This scheme allowed the municipality {{to have one of}} the lowest tax rates in Denmark {{at the same time as}} spending a huge amount of money on various welfare programs. Every child in school was given a high-end computer and the elderly were offered a free annual trip to a foreign holiday destination. A lot of prestigious building projects were initiated such as a sports arena and marina completely out of proportion to what one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> city of this size.|$|E

25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> defensive style.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E

Joanne Dorken, writing for MTV News, praised the group's stage presence {{and the content}} itself as having [...] "all the thrills and spills you would <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 1D concert".

Shortly after the line's opening, the London Evening News columnist [...] "Quex" [...] coined the abbreviated name [...] "Baker-loo", which quickly caught on and began to be used officially from July 1906, appearing on contemporary maps of the tube lines. The nickname was, however, deplored by The Railway Magazine, which complained: [...] "Some latitude is allowable, perhaps, to halfpenny papers, {{in the use of}} nicknames, but for a railway itself to adopt its gutter title, is not what we <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> railway company. English railway officers have more dignity than to act in this manner." ...|$|E

And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} {{the scene in}} which Tintin was imprisoned in the Marlinspike crypt, observing that it had parallels with Tintin's exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout the series. He identified the mystery left in Francis Haddock's parchments to be another appearance of Tintin's adventures being [...] "framed by enigmas". To this he adds that in solving the enigma, Tintin shows that he is [...] "the best reader" [...] in the series, {{and it is this}} which establishes him as [...] "the oeuvre's hero". McCarthy praised Hergé's Silk as one of the pivotal characters in the series who can [...] "exude a presence far beyond that which we might <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> novelist, let alone a cartoonist".|$|E
