5|$|In 1913, van Meegeren {{gave up his}} {{architecture}} {{studies and}} concentrated on drawing and painting at the art school in The Hague. On 8 January 1913, he received the prestigious Gold Medal from the Technical University in Delft for <b>his</b> <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence (Laurenskerk) in Rotterdam. The award was given every five years to an art student who created the best work, and {{was accompanied by a}} gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Phipps {{is known}} for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Armies of the First French Republic and the Rise of the Marshals of Napoleon I, a five volume set {{published}} posthumously from 1926–1939 by Oxford University Press. He also edited L.A. Fauvelet de Bourrienne's Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a three volume work published in 1885 and Madame Campan's The private life of Marie Antoinette, queen of France and Navarre; with sketches and anecdotes of the courts of Louis XVI, published in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones {{that marked the}} first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} from 1935 to 1956, Jolin {{spent much of his}} time travelling. In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition. It was opened in January, by Swedish {{ambassador}} Erik Boheman, at Galerie St. Etienne in New York. Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting Riddarholmen for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations building. The exhibition was shown on national TV in the United States. Jolin also exhibited his works at galleries in several other countries, and in 1957, the Liljevalchs konsthall hosted a retrospective exhibition featuring over 200 of his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E

25|$|Hilberg began <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust {{leading to}} The Destruction while {{stationed}} in Munich in 1948 for the U.S. Army's War Documentation Project.

25|$|John P. Newport, in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{impact of}} New Age beliefs, {{described}} {{the central focus}} of the Seth Material as the idea that each individual creates {{his or her own}} reality, a foundational concept of the New Age movement first articulated in the Seth Material.|$|E
25|$|He {{wrote about}} the peoples of Australia, Oceania, America and Europe, and about the Yakuts and the Altay people of Siberia. He wrote about how {{ethnology}} had evolved in Russia and in the west. Tokarev conformed to Soviet Marxist ideology and Russian nationalist views in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history of anthropology.|$|E
25|$|As {{a painter}} and muralist, Delacroix's use of {{expressive}} brushstrokes and <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical effects of colour profoundly shaped {{the work of the}} Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.|$|E

25|$|In 1953 Martin became {{acquainted with}} the Presbyterian radio Bible teacher Donald Grey Barnhouse. Barnhouse was the {{founding}} editor (1950) of the monthly periodical Eternity magazine. Stephen Board, in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history of evangelical periodicals, has observed that during its first decade of publishing Eternity was built around Barnhouse's personality and his own particular causes.|$|E
25|$|The painting's {{juxtaposition}} of fully dressed {{men and a}} nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet's composition reveals <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving of the Judgement of Paris (c. 1515) based on a drawing by Raphael.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with their Korean counterparts, executions {{committed by the}} Chinese are rather few in number. But according to author Kevin Mahoney in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PVA, executions of POWs did occur during {{the heat of the}} battle. Most of the executions appear to be committed by the lower commands without the upper echelons' knowledge, and it is often carried out to prevent the future escapes or rescues of the POWs.|$|E
50|$|Herzog {{is remembered}} for his {{writings}} on <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation (Zwingli, John Calvin, Johannes Oecolampadius), and for <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Waldensian Church.|$|R

25|$|The Delaunay orbital elements, {{commonly}} referred to as Delaunay variables, are action-angle coordinates consisting of the argument of periapsis, the mean anomaly and the longitude of the ascending node, along with their conjugate momenta. They are used to simplify perturbative calculations in celestial mechanics, for example while investigating the Kozai-Lidov oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. They were introduced by Charles-Eugène Delaunay during <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 1912, Mohawk {{was called}} upon to {{transport}} President William H.

In September, she was tasked with helping Dr. George Styles of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Potomac River.|$|E
25|$|Munday, Chettle, Dekker, and Heywood {{wrote for}} the Admiral's Men during the years before and after 1600, which may {{strengthen}} {{the idea of a}} connection between the play and that company. Shakespeare, in this context, seems the odd man out. In <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play, Scott McMillin entertains the possibility that Shakespeare's contribution might {{have been part of the}} original text from the early 1590s, when Shakespeare may have written for the Lord Strange's Men.|$|E
