5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community,</b> general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community.</b> White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community</b> to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community</b> do not {{recognize}} CFS as a real condition, nor is there agreement on its prevalence. There has been much disagreement over proposed causes, diagnosis, and treatment of the illness. This uncertainty can significantly affect doctor-patient relations. A 2006 survey of GPs in southwest England found that despite more than two thirds of them accepting CFS/ME as a recognizable clinical entity, nearly half did not feel confident with making the diagnosis and/or treating the disease. Three other key factors that were significantly, positively associated with GPs' attitudes were knowing someone socially with CFS/ME, being male and seeing more patients with the condition in the last year.|$|E

25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community,</b> dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{retrospective}} {{longitudinal study}} showed that firefighters are at higher risk for certain types of cancer.

Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed bladder cancer and prostate cancer at higher rates than the general population. The risk of bladder cancer may be present in female firefighters, but research is inconclusive as of 2014. Preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of US firefighters showed a direct relationship between the number of hours spent fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters.

25|$|Thomas and Blalock did {{groundbreaking}} {{research into}} the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. This work later evolved into research on crush syndrome and saved {{the lives of thousands}} of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II. In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by toxins in the blood. Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the vascular bed and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement. Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community</b> by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating upon the heart. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary lifesaving surgery they were to perform at Johns Hopkins a decade later.|$|E

500|$|Acne usually {{improves}} {{around the}} age of 20, but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. There is good {{evidence to support the}} idea that acne and associated scarring negatively impact a person's psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples, irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance. [...] Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and solid facial edema. [...] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community</b> to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes.|$|E

He operated clinics and hospitals in several states, and despite the fact that almost from the beginning, detractors and critics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>community</b> thoroughly discredited his methods, he was able to continue his activities for almost two decades. He was also, almost by accident, an advertising and radio pioneer who began the era of Mexican border blaster radio. Although he was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Kansas and several other states, Brinkley, a demagogue beloved by hundreds of thousands of people in Kansas and elsewhere, nevertheless launched two campaigns for Kansas governor, one of which was nearly successful. Brinkley's rise to fame and fortune was as precipitous as his eventual fall: At the height of his career he had amassed millions of dollars; yet he died sick and nearly penniless, as a result of the large number of malpractice, wrongful death and fraud suits brought against him.|$|E
