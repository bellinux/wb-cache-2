60|$|One Sunday {{afternoon}} {{he came to}} see us, thinking by mistake that Uncle William and Uncle Henry were there, but they weren't, and his manner seemed so strange and constrained that I was certain that there was something {{that he was trying to}} say and it made me dreadfully nervous and confused. And at last quite suddenly he said that there was something that he wanted to ask me if I wouldn't think it a liberty. My breath stopped and I couldn't speak, and then he went on to ask if he might lend us twenty-five dollars. He got very red in the face when he said it and he began counting out the money on the sofa, and somehow I hadn't expected that it was money and began to cry. But I told Mr. Peters that of course we couldn't think of taking any money, and I begged him to pick it up again and then I began to try to tell him about how hard it was to get along and to ask him to get work for Uncle William, but <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> again. Mr. Peters came over to my chair and took hold of the arm of it and told me not to cry. Somehow his touch on the arm of the chair thrilled all through me and though I knew that it was wrong I let him keep it there and even let him stroke the upholstery and I don't know just what would have happened but at that very minute Uncle William came in. He was most courteous to Mr. Peters and expressed his apologies for having been out and said that it must have been extremely depressing for Mr. Peters to find that he was not at home, and he thanked him for putting himself to the inconvenience of waiting. And a little while after that Mr. Peters left.|$|E

Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and <b>I</b> just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> <b>I</b> thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|R

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, <b>I</b> just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and <b>cry.</b> <b>I</b> remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|R
5000|$|She won {{the title}} Binibining Pilipinas International through Binibining Pilipinas 2012 pageant {{where she was}} also titled as Best in Swimsuit and Best in National Costume from that edition. In the question-and-answer portion, Schmitz, a law student, was asked {{by one of the}} judges John Martin Miller, [...] "Which you would rather be, someone who's {{respected}} or someone who is loved and why?" [...] Her answer: [...] "I would rather be someone respected because that means you maintain your integrity, dignity and self-respect and that means that in turn you will be loved by whoever matters and everyone around you." [...] At that time, 'Nicole Schmitz' trended on Twitter both Worldwide and Philippines. Here's an article of an interview after her win: [...] "It was actually a very surreal feeling. It didn’t even sink in for a week and when it did, <b>I</b> just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> <b>I</b> was so happy I was able to make it,” she said. Nicole shared that months before the pageant, she underwent rigorous training in walking, talking and exercise - saying, “I took this pageant seriously and I {{wanted to make sure that}} I gave it my best. Luckily, it paid off. It’s really all about determination and perseverance.” ...Of course, keeping her busy nowadays are her preparations for the Miss International that will be held in Japan on October. Nicole is undergoing another round of pageant training under the Binibining Pilipinas Foundation, and is brushing up her fluency in Nippongo as well. “I just want to live without regrets,” Nicole said ardently. “There are a lot of things I want to achieve in my life. I don’t want to miss out, I don’t want to look back and go: I should have done that when I could have,” “That’s why I came back to do this pageant,” she explained. “If I don’t do it now, I know I’ll regret it.” Nicole described her pageant experience as a “great” one, as it taught her many valuable things and at the same time, through the foundation’s charity works, she was able to give back to the community. To those who wish to follow her footsteps, Nicole’s simple message was: “I would definitely encourage it. It’s a great experience. More than anything, you learn to be a woman and you develop self-confidence and independence. Then for those girls who are unsure, it doesn’t really matter if you’re the prettiest or the tallest, because it’s really about how you shine on stage.” ...|$|R
