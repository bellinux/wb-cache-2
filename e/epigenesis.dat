5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of <b>epigenesis</b> in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epigenesis</b> is the philosophical/theological/esoteric {{idea that}} since the mind {{was given to the}} human being, it is the {{original}} creative impulse, <b>epigenesis,</b> which has been the cause of all of mankind's development.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} spiritual {{evolution}} is also complemented {{by the idea}} of a creative impulse in human beings, known as <b>epigenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in gene function that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. <b>Epigenesis</b> {{in the context of the}} biology of that period referred to the differentiation of cells from their initial totipotent state in embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-1980s, {{the group}} studied the compartimentalisation {{of the muscle}} cell upon development, {{as a model of}} {{synaptogenesis}} and in relation with the theoretical work on <b>epigenesis.</b> In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concommitent to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of gene transcription outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC, and a stimulation of gene transcription at the synapse by the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activating PKA and the ARIA (heregulin) activating tyrosine kinase cascades.|$|E
2500|$|Developmental epigenetics can {{be divided}} into {{predetermined}} and probabilistic <b>epigenesis.</b> Predetermined <b>epigenesis</b> is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA to the functional maturation of the protein. [...] "Predetermined" [...] here means that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic <b>epigenesis</b> on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "epigenetic" [...] {{has also}} been used in {{developmental}} psychology to describe psychological development {{as the result of}} an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment. Interactivist ideas of development have been discussed in various forms and under various names throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. An early version was proposed, among the founding statements in embryology, by Karl Ernst von Baer and popularized by Ernst Haeckel. A radical epigenetic view (physiological <b>epigenesis)</b> was developed by Paul Wintrebert. Another variation, probabilistic <b>epigenesis,</b> was presented by Gilbert Gottlieb in 2003. This view encompasses all of the possible developing factors on an organism and how they not only influence the organism and each other, but how the organism also influences its own development.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to spiritual}} evolution, humans build upon {{that which has}} already been created, but add new {{elements}} because of {{the activity of the}} spirit. [...] Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligencescreators. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from imitation. When <b>epigenesis</b> becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and degeneration commences.|$|E

2500|$|Jean-Pierre Changeux ( [...] ; born 6 April 1936) is a French neuroscientist {{known for}} his {{research}} in several fields of biology, from the structure and function of proteins (with {{a focus on the}} allosteric proteins), to the early development of the nervous system up to cognitive functions. Although being famous in biological sciences for the MWC model, the identification and purification of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the theory of <b>epigenesis</b> by synapse selection are also notable scientific achievements. Changeux is known by the non-scientific public for his ideas regarding the connection between mind and physical brain. As put forth in his book, Conversations on Mind, Matter and Mathematics, Changeux strongly supports the view that the [...] nervous system functions in a projective rather than reactive style and that interaction with the environment, rather than being instructive, results in the selection amongst a diversity of preexisting internal representations.|$|E
2500|$|Swammerdam's {{principal}} {{interest in}} this area was demonstrating that insects develop in the same gradual manner as other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century notion of metamorphosis—the idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) represent different individuals or a sudden change from one type of animal to another. He garnered evidence against this claim from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified underdeveloped adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, {{he noticed that the}} wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist prior to their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations to bolster his case for <b>epigenesis</b> in his 1669 publication, Historia Insectorum Generalis (The Natural History of Insects). [...] This work also included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the [...] "king" [...] bee has ovaries. [...] Biblia natura published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Despite five intense years of beekeeping, the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote, [...] "I do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females." ...|$|E
2500|$|Galen (1st and 2nd centuries AD) {{wrote about}} {{the large number of}} parts of the body and their relationships, which {{observation}} was cited as evidence for creation. The idea that the interdependence between parts would have implications for the origins of living things was raised by writers starting with Pierre Gassendi in the mid-17th century and by John Wilkins (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), [...] "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree." [...] In the late 17th-century, Thomas Burnet referred to [...] "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" [...] to argue against the eternity of life. In the early 18th century, Nicolas Malebranche wrote [...] "An organized body contains an infinity of parts that mutually depend upon one another in relation to particular ends, all of which must be actually formed in order to work as a whole", arguing in favor of preformation, rather than <b>epigenesis,</b> of the individual; and a similar argument about the origins of the individual was made by other 18th-century students of natural history. In his 1790 book, The Critique of Judgment, Kant is said by Guyer to argue that [...] "we cannot conceive how a whole that comes into being only gradually from its parts can nevertheless be the cause of the properties of those parts".|$|E
6000|$|... "Spontaneous {{generation}} {{is only a}} chimaera. This point established, two hypotheses remain: that of pre-existence and that of <b>epigenesis.</b> The one of these hypotheses has as little foundation as the other." [...] (p. 163.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctrine}} of <b>epigenesis</b> {{is derived from}} Harvey: following by ocular inspection {{the development of the}} new being in the Windsor does, he saw each part appear successively, and taking the moment of appearance for the moment of formation he imagined epigenesis." [...] (p. 165.) ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the seventeenth century, the {{doctrine}} of <b>epigenesis,</b> thus advocated by Harvey, was controverted, on the ground of direct observation, by Malpighi, who affirmed that the body of the chick is to be seen in the egg, before the punctum sanguineum makes it appearance. But, from this perfectly correct observation a conclusion which is by no means warranted was drawn; namely, that the chick, as a whole, really exists in the egg antecedently to incubation; and that what happens in the course of the latter process is no addition of new parts, [...] "alias post alias natas," [...] as Harvey puts it, but a simple expansion, or unfolding, of the organs which already exist, though they are too small and inconspicuous to be discovered. The weight of Malpighi's observations therefore fell into the scale of that doctrine which Harvey terms metamorphosis, in contradistinction to <b>epigenesis.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Harvey {{proceeds}} to contrast this view {{with that of}} the [...] "Medici," [...] or followers of Hippocrates and Galen, who, [...] "badly philosophising," [...] imagined that the brain, the heart, and the liver were simultaneously first generated in the form of vesicles; and, at the same time, while expressing his agreement with Aristotle in the principle of <b>epigenesis,</b> he maintains that it is the blood which is the primal generative part, and not, as Aristotle thought, the heart.|$|E
60|$|One of Harvey's prime objects is {{to defend}} and establish, {{on the basis}} of direct observation, the opinion already held by Aristotle; that, in the higher animals at any rate, the {{formation}} of the new organism by the process of generation takes place, not suddenly, by simultaneous accretion of rudiments of all, or of the most important, of the organs of the adult; nor by sudden metamorphosis of a formative substance into a miniature of the whole, which subsequently grows; but by <b>epigenesis,</b> or successive differentiation of a relatively homogeneous rudiment into the parts and structures which are characteristic of the adult.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{though the}} {{doctrine}} of <b>epigenesis,</b> as understood by Harvey, has definitively triumphed over {{the doctrine of}} evolution, as understood by his opponents of the eighteenth century, it is not impossible that, when {{the analysis of the}} process of development is carried still further, and the origin of the molecular components of the physically gross, though sensibly minute, bodies which we term germs is traced, the theory of development will approach more nearly to metamorphosis than to <b>epigenesis.</b> Harvey thought that impregnation influenced the female organism as a contagion; and that the blood, which he conceived to be the first rudiment of the germ, arose in the clear fluid of the [...] "colliquamentum" [...] of the ovum by a process of concrescence, as a sort of living precipitate. We now know, on the contrary, that the female germ or ovum, in all the higher animals and plants, is a body which possesses the structure of a nucleated cell; that impregnation consists in the fusion of the substance [Footnote: [At any rate of the nuclei of the two germ-cells. 1893]] of another more or less modified nucleated cell, the male germ, with the ovum; and that the structural components of the body of the embryo are all derived, by a process of division, from the coalesced male and female germs. Hence it is conceivable, and indeed probable, that every part of the adult contains molecules, derived both from the male and from the female parent; and that, regarded as a mass of molecules, the entire organism may he compared to a web of which the warp is derived from the female and the woof from the male. And each of these may constitute one individuality, in the same sense as the whole organism is one individual, although the matter of the organism has been constantly changing. The primitive male and female molecules may play the part of Buffon's [...] "moules organiques," [...] and mould the assimilated nutriment, each according to its own type, into innumerable new molecules. From this point of view the process, which, in its superficial aspect, is <b>epigenesis,</b> appears in essence, to be evolution, in the modified sense adopted in Bonnet's later writings; and development is merely the expansion of a potential organism or [...] "original preformation" [...] according to fixed laws.|$|E
6000|$|With {{more or less}} {{modification}} in detail, {{the embryo}} has been observed to pass through these successive evolutional stages in sundry Sponges, Coelenterates, Worms, Echinoderms, Tunicates, Arthropods, Mollusks, and Vertebrates; and there are valid reasons for the belief that all animals of higher organisation than the Protozoa, agree in the general character of {{the early stages of}} their individual evolution. Each, starting from the condition of a simple nucleated cell, becomes a cell-aggregate; and this passes through a condition which represents the gastrula stage, before taking on the features distinctive of the group to which it belongs. Stated in this form, the [...] "gastræa theory" [...] of Haeckel appears to the present writer to be one of most important and best founded of recent generalisations. So far as individual plants and animals are concerned, therefore, evolution is not a speculation but a fact; and it takes place by <b>epigenesis.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{striking}} example {{of the difficulty of}} getting people to use their own powers of investigation accurately, that this form of the doctrine of evolution should have held its ground so long; for it was thoroughly and completely exploded, not long after its enunciation, by Casper Friederich Wolff, who in his [...] "Theoria Generationis," [...] published in 1759, placed the opposite theory of <b>epigenesis</b> upon the secure foundation of fact, from which it has never been displaced. But Wolff had no immediate successors. The school of Cuvier was lamentably deficient in embryologists; and {{it was only in the}} course of the first thirty years of the present century, that Prévost and Dumas in France, and, later on, Döllinger, Pander, Von Bär, Rathke, and Remak in Germany, founded modern embryology; while, at the same time, they proved the utter incompatibility of the hypothesis of evolution, as formulated by Bonnet and Haller, with easily demonstrable facts.|$|E
6000|$|A grand {{discovery}} {{had been}} lately {{made by a}} certain physiologico-philosophico- psychologico-materialist, a Jayasthalian. In investigating the vestiges of creation, the cause of causes, the effect of effects, and the original origin of that Matra (matter) which some regard as an entity, others as a non-entity, others self-existent, others merely specious and therefore unexistent, he became convinced that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself After inhabiting a garret and diving {{into the depths of}} his self- consciousness for a few score years, he was able to produce such complex globule in triturated and roasted flint by means of--I will not say what. Happily for creation in general, the discovery died a natural death some centuries ago. An edifying spectacle, indeed, for the world to see; a cross old man sitting amongst his gallipots and crucibles, creating animalculae, providing the corpses of birds, beasts, and fishes with what is vulgarly called life, and supplying to <b>epigenesis</b> all the latest improvements! ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{commonly}} counted {{among the many}} merits of our great countryman, Harvey, {{that he was the}} first to declare the opposition of fact to venerable authority in this, as in other matters; but I can discover no justification for this widespread notion. After careful search through the [...] "Exercitationes de Generatione," [...] the most that appears clear to me is, that Harvey believed all animals and plants to spring from what he terms a [...] "primordium vegetale," [...] a phrase which may nowadays be rendered [...] "a vegetative germ"; and this, he says, is [...] "oviforme," [...] or [...] "egg-like"; not, he is careful to add, that it necessarily has the shape of an egg, but because it has the constitution and nature of one. That this [...] "primordium oviforme" [...] must needs, in all cases, proceed from a living parent is nowhere expressly maintained by Harvey, though such an opinion may be thought to be implied in one or two passages; while, on the other hand, he does, more than once, use language which is consistent only with a full belief in spontaneous or equivocal generation.[3] In fact, the main concern of Harvey's wonderful little treatise is not with generation, in the physiological sense, at all, but with development; and his great object is the establishment of the doctrine of <b>epigenesis.</b>|$|E
