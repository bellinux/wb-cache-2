40|$|AbstractA new {{notion of}} input/output {{equivalence}} of distributed imperative programs, with synchronous communications, is introduced. It preserves the input/output relation, encompassing both, initial/final state and communication channel values. For its mathematical justification, the semantic framework of Manna and Pnueli, based on finite transition systems and reduced behaviors, is extended {{with the notion}} of input/output behavior. A set of laws for the equivalence is overviewed. A deduction rule for the substitution of references to input/output <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures</b> is defined and justified in the new semantics. The rule is applied to decompose distributed program simplification proofs, introduced in a prior work, which use the laws to establish the equivalence between a sequential and a parallel communicating program. They include communication elimination as one of their steps. An outline of one of such proofs, for a pipelined processor model, is included...|$|E

40|$|For {{most high}} level languages, two {{procedures}} are equivalent if they transform {{a pair of}} isomorphic stores to isomorphic stores. How- ever, tools for modular checking of such equivalence impose a stronger check where isomorphism is strengthened to equality of stores.

In this work, we present RIE, a methodology to modularly establish equivalence of procedures {{in the presence of}} memory allocation, cyclic data structures and recursion. Our technique addresses the need for find- ing witnesses to isomorphism with angelic allocation, supports reasoning about <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures</b> calls when the stores are only locally iso- morphic, and reasoning about changes in the order of procedure calls.

40|$|We {{establish}} that a non-Gaussian nonparametric regression model is asymptoticaly {{equivalent to a}} regression model with Gaussian noise. The approximation is {{in the sense of}} Le Cam 2 ̆ 7 s deficiency distance Δ; the models are then asymptotically equivalent for all purposes of statistical decision with bounded loss. Our result concerns a sequence of independent but not identically distributed observations with each distribution in the same real-indexed location family. The canonical parameter is a value f(ti) of a regression function f at a grid point ti. When f is in a Holder ball with exponent β 3 ̆e 12, we establish global asymptotic equivalence to observations of a signal f(t) in Gaussian white noise. The proof is based on an application of Edgeworth expansion for partial sums. The results are constructive.

40|$|The gauge-invariant {{generation}} of a dynamical, momentum-dependent gluon mass is intimately {{connected with the}} presence of non-perturbative massless poles in the vertices of the theory, which trigger the well-known Schwinger mechanism. In the deep infrared the integral equation that governs this effective gluon mass assumes a particularly simple form, which may be derived following two seemingly different, but ultimately <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures.</b> In particular, it may be obtained either as a deviation from a special identity that enforces the masslessness of the gluon in the absence of massless poles, or as a direct consequence of the appearance of a non-vanishing bound-state wave function, associated with the details of the actual formation of these massless poles. In this presentation we demonstrate that, due to profound relations between the various ingredients, the two versions of the gluon mass equation are in fact absolutely identical.

40|$|Four {{aspects of}} the debate between Hofstede and Javidan et al. are highlighted.

Furthermore, the number of dimensions of national culture that can be usefully studied must be proportional to the limited number of nations available for comparative analyses. Third, although Hofstede and Javidan et al. appear to differ on optimal ways of aggregating individual-level data to the nation level, both appear to have done so {{in a way that does}} not prevent detection of differing relations between items at different levels of analysis. Finally, we need greater clarity as to the ways in which national wealth relates to other aspects of culture. It is a major component of contemporary national cultures, and must be retained as an element within nation-level analyses.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{learning}} a latent tree graphical model where samples are available only from a subset of variables. We propose two consistent and computationally efficient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms {{can be applied to}} both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our first algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close {{to each other in the}} true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures</b> such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efficient learning of latent trees. W...|$|E

40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) based {{simulations}} of photon transport in living tissues {{have become the}} "gold standard" technique in biomedical optics. Three-dimensional (3 D) voxel-based images are the natural way to represent human (and animal) tissues. It is generally believed {{that the combination of}} 3 D images and MC based algorithms allows one to produce the most realistic models of photon propagation. In the present work, it is shown that this approach may lead to large errors in the MC data due to the "roughness" of the geometrical boundaries generated by the presence of the voxels. In particular, the computed intensity of the light detected on the tissue surface of a simple cubic tissue phantom may display errors from - 80 % to 120 %. It is also shown that these errors depend in a complex manner on optical and geometrical parameters such as the interoptode distance, scattering coefficient, refractive index, etc. and on the degree of voxelization ("roughness") of the boundaries. It is concluded that if one wants to perform reliable 3 D Monte Carlo simulations on complex geometries, such as human brain, skin or trabecular bone, it is necessary to introduce boundary meshing techniques or other <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures</b> in the MC code to eliminate the deleterious effect of voxelization...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that birds and primates have a rich repertoire of behavioral and cognitive skills, but the mechanisms underlying these abilities are not well understood. A common hypothesis is that these adaptations are mediated by an efficient long-term memory, allowing animals to remember specific external events and associate appropriate behaviors to these events. Because earlier studies have not sufficiently challenged memory capacity in animals, our comparative research examined with <b>equivalent</b> <b>procedures</b> the size and mechanisms of long-term memory in baboons and pigeons. Findings revealed very large, but different, capacities in both species to learn and remember picture–response associations. Pigeons could maximally memorize between 800 and 1, 200 picture–response associations before reaching the limit of their performance. In contrast, baboons minimally memorized 3, 500 – 5, 000 items and had not reached their limit after more than 3 years of testing. No differences were detected in how these associations were retained or otherwise processed by these species. These results demonstrate that pigeons and monkeys have sufficient memory resources to develop memory-based exemplar or feature learning strategies in many test situations. They further suggest that the evolution of cognition and behavior importantly may have involved the gradual enlargement of the long-term memory capacities of the brain...|$|E
