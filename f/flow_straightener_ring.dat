40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The U-type Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) {{involves}} {{a change in}} the direction of gas flow as it proceeds from the regenerator to the pulse tube. The sharp U-bend has an adverse effect on pulse tube cooling action due to formation of eddies and undesirable mixing in the cold end of the pulse tube. The present work deals with experimentation and CFD modeling related to U-type PTCs. Two cases of ‘U’ bends have been studied; gradual ‘U’ bends and sharp ‘U’ bends. Experimentation has been carried out using copper screens of 100 -mesh size as <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners.</b> The optimum performance in terms of low temperature for the case of a gradual U bend was achieved with a stack of 18 flow-straightener screens. The no-load temperature for this case of a gradual ‘U’ bend, with and without <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners,</b> was 57. 7 K and 88. 8 K, respectively, for a charging pressure of 16 bar. When the gradual 180 degree bend at the cold end was replaced by a sharp U bend, the no load temperature increased from 88. 8 K to 137 K without <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners.</b> In order to understand the role of <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners</b> in PTC, a CFD model was developed in FLUENT. The <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners</b> are modeled as a homogeneous porous medium. The results show that the <b>flow</b> <b>straighteners</b> significantly affect velocity patterns in the pulse tube.

40|$|A <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> {{has been}} {{incorporated}} into a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, inner drum, and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} shroud plate. These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the <b>flow</b> <b>straightener...</b>|$|R

If this water could be recovered and routed to the fuel reformer it would markedly increase the portability of PEM fuel cells. 	The goal of this research was to test a previously designed axial flow moisture separator. The separator was employed in a test bed which utilized compressed, heated air mixed with steam to simulate the oxidant exhaust conditions of a 25 kW PEM fuel cell. The simulated exhaust was saturated with water. The mixture was expanded through the turbine side of an automotive turbocharger, which dropped the temperature and pressure of the mixture, causing water to condense, making it available for separation. The humid air mixture was passed over an axial flow centrifugal separator and water was removed from the flow. 	The separator was tested in a variety of conditions with and without passing chilled water through the separator. The axial separator was tested independently, with a <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> preceding it, and with a commercially available centrifugal moisture separator in series following it.

40|$|At {{times it}} would seem that {{practical}} application of things learned in analytical work is not readily identifiable. Such is not the case with this paper. I would like to point out one very practical application of the knowledge available to the reader. The knowledge I refer to is the reduction in overall pressure loss associated {{with the addition of a}} properly-proportioned dif-fuser to a flow nozzle. Let us consider the situation. As the electric utilities install larger turbine-generator units, higher capacity flow-measuring sections are required when running ASME Performance Tests. We find that there are practical limits to the design of these flow sections. First, pipe size is limited by laboratory calibration capability and by space in the power plant heat cycle. Second, the ASME PTC 6 limits the beta ratio of a flow nozzle to 0. 5. Third, we are limited as to design nozzle pressure drop by manometer capability, and finally, by pumping head available. Multiple flow sections used in parallel are one viable solution, particularly useful in cycles with multiple strings of feedwater heaters. But there are ob-jections to this arrangement also. The cost of each additional flow section puts pressure on the engineer to search for an alternative way to accurately measure water flow in a turbine cycle. The addition of a diffuser to a flow nozzle offers some temporary relief to the flow nozzle capacity problem. Thus for the same overall pressure loss as obtained without a diffuser, as shown in the figure, one can increase the flow capability 30 percent by the use of a diffuser. This curve assumes a multiplate <b>flow</b> <b>straightener,</b> a device with a relatively high pressure drop within itself. If we instead assume a tube-type <b>flow</b> <b>straightener,</b> the <b>flow</b> increase is somewhat greater, on the order of 35 percent.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) uses a {{turbine fuel}} {{flowmeter}} (FFM) in its Low Pressure Fuel Duct (LPFD) to measure liquid hydrogen flowrates during engine operation. The flowmeter {{is required to}} provide accurate and robust measurements of flow rates ranging from 10000 to 18000 GPM in an environment contaminated by duct vibration and duct internal acoustic disturbances. Errors exceeding 0. 5 % can {{have a significant impact}} on engine operation and mission completion. The accuracy of each sensor is monitored during hot-fire engine tests on the ground. Flow meters which do not meet requirements are not flown. Among other parameters, the device is screened for a specific behavior in which a small shift in the flow rate reading is registered during a period in which the actual fuel flow as measured by a facility meter does not change. Such behavior has been observed over the years for specific builds of the FFM and must be avoided or limited in magnitude in flight. Various analyses of the recorded data have been made prior to this report in an effort to understand the cause of the phenomenon; however, no conclusive cause for the shift in the instrument behavior has been found. The present report proposes an explanation of the phenomenon based on interactions between acoustic pressure disturbances in the duct and the wakes produced by the FFM <b>flow</b> <b>straightener.</b> Physical insight into the effects of acoustic plane wave disturbances was obtained using a simple analytical model. Based on that model, a series of three-dimensional unsteady viscous flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using the MSFC PHANTOM turbomachinery code. The code was customized to allow the FFM rotor speed to change at every time step according to the instantaneous fluid forces on the rotor, that, in turn, are affected by acoustic plane pressure waves propagating through the device. The results of the simulations show the variation in the rotation rate of the flowmeter due to the interaction of the <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> wakes and the upstream propagating acoustic waves. A detailed analysis of the acoustic disturbance effects is presented along with an assessment of the impact on measurement accuracy...|$|R

However, near the end of that test entry, two of the vortex generators mounted on the compressor exit tailcone failed causing minor damage to the honeycomb <b>flow</b> <b>straightener.</b> The vortex generators were removed from the facility and calibration testing was terminated. A follow-up test entry was conducted in 1997 in order to fully calibrate the facility without the effects of the vortex generators and to provide a complete calibration of the newly expanded low speed operating range. During the 1997 tunnel entry, all planned test points required for a complete test section calibration were obtained. This data set included detailed in-plane and axial flow field distributions for use in quantifying the test section flow quality...|$|R
40|$|Real time {{monitoring}} of toxic metallic effluents in confined gas streams {{can be accomplished}} through use of Microwave Induced Plasmas to perform atomic emission spectroscopy, For this diagnostic to be viable {{it is necessary that}} it sample from the flowstream of interest in an isokinetic manner. A method of isokinetic sampling was established for this device for use in the exhaust system of a plasma hearth vitrification furnace. The flow and entrained particulate environment were simulated in the laboratory setting using a variable flow duct of the same dimensions (8 -inch diameter, schedule 40) as that in the field and was loaded with similar particulate (less than 10 {mu}m in diameter) of lake bed soil typically used in the vitrification process. The flow from the furnace was assumed to be straight flow. To reproduce this effect a <b>flow</b> <b>straightener</b> was installed in the device. An isokinetic sampling train was designed to include the plasma torch, with microwave power input operating at 2. 45 GHz, to match local freestream velocities between 800 and 2400 ft/sec. The isokinetic sampling system worked as planned and the plasma torch had no difficulty operating at the required flowrates. Simulation of the particulate suspension was also successful. Steady particle feeds were maintained {{over long periods of time}} and the plasma diagnostic responded as expected...|$|R
