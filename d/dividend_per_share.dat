The relationship between <b>dividends</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> (DPS) and <b>dividend</b> cover was also examined with similar results.

50|$|An {{increase}} in the Bank’s share capital took place, amounting to €1.25 billion (June 2005). This capital increase allowed the Bank {{to deal with the}} problems encountered after adopting the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and has hence contributed to the substantial reorganization of the Bank’s financial statements.The Bank implemented the Panotokia Law, which benefited in total 63.220 debtors of whom 54.000 were farmers. Loans written off amounted to EUR 1.8 billion of which EUR 1.1 billion concerned debts of farmers. In November 2005, the share of the Bank became a constituent of the FTSE/Athex 20 Index.

5000|$|Share repurchases {{also allow}} {{companies}} to distribute their earnings to investors without inflicting them with taxation. For example, {{if a company}} were to pay US$100,000 in dividends on one million shares or as 10¢ <b>dividend</b> <b>per</b> <b>share,</b> investors may incur tax upon this disbursement. This means that instead of receiving 10¢ of earnings per share, they receive 8.5¢ (.10×(1 − [...]15)) at a 15% tax rate with 1.5¢ going to the government. An investor with 10 shares will receive 85¢. As the company has to pay out this money the share price drops accordingly, from US$10 to US$9.90, so the investor with 10 shares now has; US$99 + 85¢ dividend, or US$99.85. Of course, the market will not necessarily respond to a dividend payment by selling off shares and reducing share price; while the payment of the dividend technically reduces the company's book value, the ability and willingness to pay a dividend is often seen positively, and the share price may even increase.|$|E

50|$|The {{board of}} directors, elected representatives of shareholders/stockholders, {{is a group}} of {{individuals}} that announce and declare a dividend. The day that the dividend is announced on is called the declaration date. This day is very important to investors who are looking to invest in a stock that yields dividends. In regards to dividends, the date of record is the day that a stockholder needs to be registered by in order to receive the dividend. If a stockholder registers on or before the date of record then the investor is classified as a holder of record. A company's payment date is the day the Company disperses its dividends to all of the holders of record invested into that said company. Payment dates differ between companies; however dividends are usually distributed 3 weeks after the date of record. Each company provides different dividends amounts to their shareholders. The dividend yield of a company is the percentage paid to the investor. In technical terms it is defined as the dollar amount of the dividend over the (divided by) common share price of the stock. Dividends are a way to make money in the stock market even if the stock one purchase is not going up. It is a good thing for investors to know which companies have good dividends and/or which companies can afford to maintain their current dividends. That is where the dividend payout ratio comes into play. This ratio is an indicator for investors about the companies that they might potentially invest in. This ratio can be broken down to a very simple formula which is: <b>dividend</b> <b>per</b> <b>share</b> divided by a company's common earning per share. This dividend payout ratio is a great indicator on whether or not a company can continue to pay its investors the dividends.|$|E

Research limitations/implications – Quarterly CRSP and Compustat data from 2000 to 2006 for 1, 902 dividend-paying firms are analyzed.
