The following results were obtained: (a) light-initiated slow responses with and without superimposed spike potentials were recorded from retinula cells and from eccentric cells (only one eccentric cell yielded responses without superimposed spike potentials); (b) spike potentials recorded in different cells within the same ommatidium were always synchronous; (c) a complete absence of spike potentials was observed in two experiments in which no eccentric cells {{could be found in}} the ommatidia containing the labeled retinula cells; (d) the greatest differences in the characteristics of responses recorded simultaneously occurred in those recorded from retinula-eccentric combinations.

The suggestion is advanced that the response of the retinula cell may "trigger" the eccentric cell response...|$|E

We wish {{to predict the}} value of a function on the basis of discrete observational dat a that are incomplete <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses.</b> Only certain arguments of the function ar e observed, and the function value is observed only for certain combinations of values of these arguments.
