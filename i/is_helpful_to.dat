25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the propagation of}} action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs, it <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the axon hillock. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing. There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So it <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate how {{it applies to}} more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the {{uncertainty principle}}. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates {{it in a way}} that generalizes more easily.|$|E
25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, it <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E

25|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is required}} to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. It <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture toughness material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture toughness. It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|In typical {{people who}} are not known to be at high risk of PE, imaging <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> confirm or exclude a {{diagnosis}} of PE after simpler first-line tests are used. Medical societies recommend tests such as the D-dimer to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging, and imaging would be done if other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{approaches are}} applied by interpreters {{specifically to the}} book of Revelation, but Revelation occupies such a central place in Christian eschatology that it is worth mentioning them in this, more general, overview.
