50|$|US 167 {{has several}} {{different}} <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> {{over the course}} of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The route is classified as an urban principal arterial through most of the cities it serves. Outside of town, the majority of the route serves as a rural minor arterial south of Alexandria and as a rural principal arterial northward. Two notable exceptions are the portions running concurrent with I-49, which are classified as urban and rural interstates, and the portion between Ville Platte and Turkey Creek, which is a rural major collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 53,500 vehicles in Lafayette and 56,100 in Alexandria, both along concurrencies with I-49. The lowest count reported was 1,110 vehicles north of Turkey Creek.|$|E
5000|$|LA 98 {{has several}} <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> {{over the course}} of its route, as {{determined}} by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). It is classified as an urban principal arterial in Carencro and an urban minor arterial in Rayne. Outside of these cities, the highway ranges from a rural major collector through the Iota area to a rural local road over the lightly traveled portions near Maxie and Mire. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 18,500 vehicles in Rayne and 7,000 through Carencro. The rural portions of the route generally averaged less than 3,000 vehicles daily with a low of 970 reported between Maxie and Roberts Cove. [...] The posted speed limit is generally 55 mph in rural areas, reduced to between 30 mph and 45 mph through town.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of issues}} in objectively {{identifying}} functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans {{to develop a}} new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. <b>Functional</b> <b>classifications</b> continued {{to be used in the}} 2010s. In 2010, the IPC announced that they would release a new IPC Athletics Classification handbook that specifically dealt with physical impairments. This classification guide would be put into effect following the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Athletes needed to be at least 18 years old to compete in the T40/F40 and T41/F41 classes. This was to prevent still growing children from competing in this class despite otherwise not having a disability.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} accuracy of demand forecasts using a sample of recently-completed projects in Minnesota and identifies the factors influencing the inaccuracy in forecasts. Based on recent research on forecast accuracy, the inaccuracy of traffic forecasts is estimated as the difference between forecast traffic and actual traffic, standardized by the actual traffic. The analysis indicates a general trend of underestimation in roadway traffic forecasts with factors such as roadway type, functional classification and direction playing an influencing role. Roadways with higher volumes and higher <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> such as freeways are underestimated compared to lower volume roadways and lower <b>functional</b> <b>classifications.</b> The comparison of demographic forecasts shows a trend of overestimation while the comparison of travel behavior characteristics indicates a lack of incorporation of fundamental shifts and societal changes.

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>classifications</b> {{have been}} seen as a {{necessary}} tool for the simplification of floristic complexity in global vegetation models (Neilson et al. 1992; Prentice et al. 1992; Foley et al. 1996; Woodward & Cramer 1996), for mapping vegetation patterns at key times in the past (Prentice and Webb 1998; Prentice et al. 2000), and for monitoring effects of global change or management on vegetation distribution and ecosystem processes (Díaz et al. 2002 a, Cruz et al. 2002). Plant <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> were first designed by grouping plants a priori based on knowledge of their function, or based on observed correlations among their morphological, physiological, biochemical, reproductive or demographic characteristics (Woodward & Cramer 1996; Smith et al. 1997). It was assumed that these classifications would allow to predict changes in ecosystem processes directly from projected changes in plant species composition in response to global change. This idea was challenged by the recognition that functional effect groups (species with a similar effect on one or several ecosystem functions; e. g. primary productivity, nutrient cycling, Gitay & Noble 1997, Walker et al. 1999) and functional response groups (groups of species with a similar response to...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic lethals are to {{pairs of}} non-essential genes whose {{simultaneous}} deletion prohibits growth. One can extend {{the concept of}} synthetic lethality by considering gene groups of increasing size where only the simultaneous elimination of all genes is lethal, whereas individual gene deletions are not. We developed optimization-based procedures for the exhaustive and targeted enumeration of multi-gene (and by extension multi-reaction) lethals for genome-scale metabolic models. Specifically, these approaches are applied to iAF 1260, the latest model of Escherichia coli, leading to the complete identification of all double and triple gene and reaction synthetic lethals {{as well as the}} targeted identification of quadruples and some higher-order ones. Graph representations of these synthetic lethals reveal a variety of motifs ranging from hub-like to highly connected subgraphs providing a birds-eye view of the avenues available for redirecting metabolism and uncovering complex patterns of gene utilization and interdependence. The procedure also enables the use of falsely predicted synthetic lethals for metabolic model curation. By analyzing the <b>functional</b> <b>classifications</b> of the genes involved in synthetic lethals, we reveal surprising connections within and across clusters of orthologous group <b>functional</b> <b>classifications...</b>|$|E
