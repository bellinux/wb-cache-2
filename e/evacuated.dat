40|$|In {{this study}} we {{implement}} a set of econometric models to analyze the determinants of household hurricane evacuation choice for a sample of 1, 355 households in Florida. This article {{contributes to the literature}} by accounting for two issues normally neglected in previous studies; namely, time and space. The empirical results suggest that households living in risky environments (mobile home and flooding areas) are more likely to <b>evacuate.</b> In addition, households with kids and those who have experience the treat of a hurricane also display higher probabilities to <b>evacuate.</b> Conversely, homeowners and households with pets are less likely to <b>evacuate</b> than their counterparts. Regional differences in propensity to <b>evacuate</b> are also clearly demonstrated, with households in southeast Florida less likely to <b>evacuate</b> than those in northwest Florida. hurricane, evacuation choice, probit, Environmental Economics and Policy, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

5|$|Ahead of the storm, all {{ports in}} Gujarat, {{including}} Kandla, {{one of the}} largest in the country, were closed as a precautionary measure. On May25, over 10,000 people were <b>evacuated</b> from coastal areas in the threatened region. Throughout India, a total of 118,800 people were <b>evacuated</b> and 100,000 more were <b>evacuated</b> in Pakistan. The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the United States {{military}} flew planes {{away from}} the coast to safer shelters further inland. Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. Naval ships rode out the storm at sea, while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened shelters and mobilized 41officials with experience in hurricanes. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000people <b>evacuated</b> the coastline, some to the 79Red Cross shelters opened up. About 2,000people <b>evacuated</b> from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts <b>evacuated</b> 800scouts from Camp Delmont due {{to the threat of}} the hurricane. The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car.

30|$|We {{found that}} households’ {{evacuation}} behavior differed significantly by locations. Specifically, households living in {{proximity to the}} Natech accident {{were more likely to}} <b>evacuate</b> at once when they perceived its threat (r = − 0.12), whereas those living further away tended to shelter in place (r =  0.21). Moreover, those at a higher elevation were also prone to delay their evacuation (r =  0.27) and shelter in place (r =  0.18). Furthermore, those living to {{the east side of the}} industrial park were more likely to <b>evacuate</b> immediately (r =  0.23) and, even for those did not <b>evacuate</b> initially were more likely to <b>evacuate</b> than those in the west side (r =  0.32) some time later.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} full-time wheelchair users with spinal cord injuries who felt they could <b>evacuate</b> from various locations, and the percentage who {{have a plan for}} evacuation. Study results will help clinicians and emergency officials understand needs related to evacuation preparedness. Design Convenience sample su rvey. Setting Six Spinal Cord Injury Model System centers, part of the national database funded through the Department of Education, National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. Participants People (N= 487) with spinal cord injuries who use a wheelchair more than 40 hours a week. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The percentage of wheelchair users who felt {{they would be able to}} safely <b>evacuate,</b> had a plan for safe evacuation, or reported a need for assistive technology and human assistance to <b>evacuate</b> from various locations in the event of an emergency. Results The highest percentage of participants felt they would be able to safely <b>evacuate</b> and had a plan for work evacuation. The lowest percentage of participants reported they could <b>evacuate</b> from their city/town in the event of an emergency and had a plan to <b>evacuate</b> their city/town in the event of a natural disaster. A large difference exists between the percentage of participants who felt they could <b>evacuate</b> and those who have a plan for evacuation. Conclusions A large discrepancy exists between the perception that one can <b>evacuate</b> and actually having a plan. The perception that one can <b>evacuate</b> without a plan or the use of assistive technology is an area of concern that must be further addressed by educators. Education must emphasize the need to have a defined evacuation plan and effective utilization of assistive technology. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|R
