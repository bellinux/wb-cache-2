5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the <b>instructional</b> <b>material</b> is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the <b>instructional</b> <b>material.</b> Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

The study sought to examine the instructional effectiveness of video-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> vis-à-vis traditional print-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> for teaching distance learners of a Block-Laying and Concreting practical skills programme. An experimental design was used and participants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: Users of video-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> or users of print-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials.</b> A researcher-designed performance test and an achievement test of 20 multiple-choice items were used to collect data from 34 participants who used print-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> and 35 participants who used video-based <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> to learn practical skills.

Filed in 2000 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the State of California, the suit alleged a failure to provide adequate facilities, textbooks, and teachers for the poorest schools in the state. The case was named after Eliezer Williams, a middle school student age 12 at the time, who {{would go on to}} graduate from Balboa. The lawsuit was resolved in 2004, with the administration of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger agreeing to provide US$138 million for <b>instructional</b> <b>material,</b> US$50 million for critical facility repairs at nearly 2,400 state schools, and to reimburse school districts for future repairs of deficient facilities.

The major findings of this study, revealed that there was inadequacy of <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> in pre primary units, whereby the few available ones were mainly for teaching the 3 R’s. It was also revealed that the utilization of <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> was affected by teacher- pupil ratio, whereby the utilization was minimal in school with high teacher-pupil ratio. Also the classroom space and arrangement was poor such that effective facilitation by class teachers in using learning materials was restricted to only a few pupils.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} how secondary school mathematics teachers select and use <b>instructional</b> <b>materials.</b> It was a qualitative study.

Often teachers look at <b>instructional</b> <b>materials,</b> such as textbooks as curriculum. However, the <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> alone do not build the curriculum. It is the encounter between teachers, <b>instructional</b> <b>materials</b> and students that brings about the enacted curriculum.

At the classroom level the teachers 2 ̆ 7 autonomy concerning selection of material was found limited and was concerned with the how of teaching only. The classroom teaching was found more textbook directed. The teachers 2 ̆ 7 selection of the content was selective and was influenced by several factors such as instructional time, syllabus, beliefs about teaching and learning, and beliefs about technology. The study also identified several issues related to teachers 2 ̆ 7 selection and use of <b>instructional</b> <b>materials.</b> Teachers 2 ̆ 7 selection was guided by cognitive, syllabus and management concerns. However their analysis did not go beyond to broader sociological issues, for example, gender bias, which was reinforced by the teachers 2 ̆ 7 unawareness of the issues. Design errors appeared to be another issue whereby the teachers were not concerned with precisions, which could be the possible sources of student misconceptions.
