40|$|Summary:. The first {{description}} of simultaneous pelvic and abdominal soft-tissue reconstruction {{with a giant}} lower limb <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> after hip exarticulation and open abdomen is presented. The unfortunate circumstances of a 67 -year-old female patient are described leading to soft-tissue necrosis over a periprosthetic femur fracture and open abdomen after emergency implantation of an aortic bifemoral Y-prosthesis because of thrombotic obliteration of the aortic bifurcation. After removal of the hip prosthesis, the neurovascular pedicled myocutaneous <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> of the entire left leg was raised and folded proximally {{at the level of}} the exarticulated joint of the hip and set into the pelvic and abdominal defect. A giant pedicled neurovascular myocutaneous <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> raised over the entire lower extremity is a safe, effective, durable, and sensation-preserving treatment to reconstruct combined pelvic and abdominal soft-tissue defects...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds: Reconstruction after hemipelvectomy is very {{important}} for rehabilitation into society. The pelvis plays an important role for support of the intra-abdominal organs. Methods: We operated 3 cases using <b>fillet</b> <b>flaps</b> with the femoral periosteum for reconstruction of hemipelvectomy defect. Results: It is useful to elevate the flap all around with the femoral periosteum, because the periosteum can be sutured to supporting pelvic structures with the aim to support intra-abdominal organs. Conclusion: Without alternative supports for the bony pelvis, pelvic reconstructions are at risk for hernia and it may be difficult for outpatients to fit their habiliments after radical cure. The rigid support for the intra-abdominal organs occurs in association with the suture pelvic and femoral periosteum...|$|R
40|$|Fourth-degree {{extremity}} burns involve muscle, tendon, and bone, often {{leading to}} amputa-tion or significant functional impairment. We report our 10 -year experience (1995 - 2004) at an urban burn center with fourth-degree burns {{to the lower}} extremity to characterize treat-ments and outcomes. Twenty-one patients (40 limbs), mean age of 45 years, were treated for fourth-degree lower-extremity burns with the average extremity burn size of 24 % TBSA (range, 2 – 36 %) and a mean fourth-degree burn size of 9 % TBSA (range, 2 – 18 %). A mean of eight operations were required for limb salvage. Six free-tissue transfers, 2 <b>fillet</b> <b>flaps,</b> 14 local flaps, and multiple skin grafts were performed. Five patients underwent tibial burring for granulation tissue stimulation, and the subatmospheric pressure device was used in eight patients. Seven limb amputations (18 %) were required in four patients, and 76 % of patients were ambulatory on follow-up. The mean hospital stay was 76 days with high rates of cellu-litis, deep vein thrombosis, and bacteremia. Patients treated with flap closure had a signifi-cant {{decrease in the number}} of operations required for limb salvage. Fourth-degree lower-extremity burns require multistage reconstructive procedures using multiple levels of the reconstructive ladder but limb salvage is possible in a majority of cases.

40|$|This case {{illustrates}} {{some important}} {{technical aspects of}} lower limb reconstruction. The free <b>fillet</b> of sole <b>flap</b> can be salvaged from an amputated lower extremity and used to reconstruct traumatic defects in ipsilateral and contralateral lower limbs.

40|$|Reusing {{tissue of}} amputated or unsalvageable limbs to {{reconstruct}} soft tissue defects is {{one aspect of}} the "spare parts concept. " Using a free <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> in such situations enables the successful formation of a proximal stump with the length needed to cover a large defect from forequarter amputation without risking additional donor-site morbidity. The use of free fillet flaps for reconstruction after forequarter and traumatic upper extremity amputations is illustrated here in a case report. A 41 -year old patient required a forequarter amputation to resect a desmoid tumor, resulting in an extensive soft-tissue defect of the upper extremity. A free <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> of the amputated arm and an additional local epaulette flap were used to reconstruct the defect. At 9 months after the procedure, a satisfactory result with a very well healed flap was attained. Free fillet flaps can be used successfully for reconstruction of large upper extremity defects, without risking additional donor-site morbidity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Multiple large decubitus ulcers {{present a}} {{reconstructive}} {{challenge to the}} plastic surgeon. When stage IV pressure sores become recurrent or extensive, traditional flaps either have already been exhausted or would {{not be sufficient to}} cover the defect. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on all paraplegic patients who had chronic, extensive, and stage IV decubitus ulcers, and underwent reconstruction using a pedicled continuous musculocutaneous flap of the entire leg between 1998 and 2007. The extent and size of the debrided pressure sores, number of previous flap reconstructions, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, and years of follow-up were all recorded. A description of the operative technique is also given. Results: Four patients underwent a total leg <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> in the study period, with follow-up ranging from 2 to 7 years. Indications included extensive and bilateral trochanteric, sacral, and ischial pressure sores. Complications included intraoperative blood loss and postoperative heterotopic calcification.

40|$|Six {{patients}} with insufficient soft-tissue coverage after lower limb trauma {{were treated with}} pedicled <b>fillet</b> of foot <b>flaps</b> to achieve primary stump closure and to preserve leg length. The flaps used were all based on either the posterior tibial neurovascular pedicle, the anterior tibial neurovascular pedicle, or both. Five flaps survived; one patient required conversion of a through-knee to an above-knee amputation and debridement of the flap because of venous thrombosis of the pedicle. In three of the cases, a functional knee joint was preserved. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 21 to 54 years, the mean hospital stay was 55. 5 days (range, 28 to 76 days), and the mean follow-up time was 14. 5 months. Despite an average of 4. 3 procedures from initial admission to first discharge and an average of 2. 0 postamputation procedures to achieve primary stump healing, all patients have achieved independent mobility with their prosthesis. The advantages of preserving leg length and, where possible, preserving a functional knee joint compensate for repeated procedures on these patients. When planned well, a pedicled <b>fillet</b> of foot <b>flap</b> therefore achieves the aims of amputation, namely, providing primary healing of a sensate, durable, cylindrical stump that is pain-free and preserves maximal leg length. This is achieved with no donor-site morbidity and with no need for microvascular reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|Introduction] Morel-Lavallée lesions are {{posttraumatic}} hemolymphatic collections {{caused by}} {{disruption of the}} interfascial planes between the subcutaneous soft tissue and muscle. Severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions have rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. By contrast, a number of cases of gluteal muscle necrosis following transcatheter angiographic embolization for pelvic fracture have been reported. Each entity can result in severe infection and sepsis, and the mortality rate in such cases is quite high. However, to date, no previous reports have described a case in which these life-threatening entities occurred simultaneously. [Case presentation] A 32 -year-old Asian man simultaneously developed severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions and gluteal muscle necrosis with sepsis following transcatheter angiographic embolization after an unstable pelvic fracture. Extremely large skin and soft tissue defects, which were untreatable with any commonly used flaps, were generated after repeated debridement. In addition, a deep-bone infection was suspected in his left fractured iliac bone, while motor function was almost completely lost in his left leg, possibly as a sequela of transcatheter angiographic embolization. As a result of his condition, a left hemipelvectomy was unavoidable. A pedicled <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> from his sacrificed left limb was used for the treatment of the defects and to provide a durable base for a prosthesis. Our patient survived and returned to his previous job 24 months after the surgery wearing a prosthetic left leg. [Conclusion] As illustrated by the present case, severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions and gluteal muscle necrosis following transcatheter angiographic embolization can occur simultaneously after unstable pelvic fractures. Physicians should recognize that these entities can result in life-threatening sepsis and, therefore, should attempt to detect them as early as possible. When hemipelvectomy is unavoidable, a pedicled upper and lower leg in-continuity <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> may provide satisfactory outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Wide margin {{resection}} of extremity tumor sometimes {{leaves a}} huge soft tissue and bony defects in limb salvage surgery. Adequate management of these defects {{is an absolute}} requirement when aiming for functional limb. Multidisciplinary management in such cases is an answer when complex biologic reconstruction is desired. We aim to present cases of osteogenic sarcoma of lower extremity requiring combined surgical approach to achieve effective musculoskeletal reconstruction. Patients and Methods. From 2006 to 2010 ten patients were operated on for osteogenic sarcoma of lower extremity requiring complex musculoskeletal reconstruction. Results. Six patients had pathology around knee joint, whereas one each with mid tibia, mid femur, proximal femur, and heel bone. Locking compression plate was used in 7 patients including six with periarticular disease. Eight out of ten patients underwent biologic reconstruction using autograft; endoprosthetic reconstruction and hindquarter amputation were done in the remaining two patients. Vascularized fibula was done in five patients, sural artery flap which was primarily done in three patients, spare part <b>fillet</b> <b>flap,</b> free iliac crest flap, and Gastrocnemius flap was done in one patient each. Secondary hemorrhage, infection, nonunion, wound dehiscence, and flap failure were notable complications in four patients. The Average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 89 %. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract: Digital fillet flaps have a {{consistent}} vascular supply and provide durable soft-tissue coverage. Despite their readily available nature, {{their use in}} the foot remains limited. This systematic review was undertaken to determine the size defect that could be covered, the potential postoperative complications, and the durability of a digital <b>fillet</b> <b>flap.</b> Studies were eligible for inclusion if they involved use of the entire digit for soft-tissue coverage of defects of any etiology, reported complications, and had any length of follow-up time. A total of 9 studies met all the inclusion criteria, {{for a total of}} 34 patients with a combined mean age of 47. 1 years and a combined mean follow-up time of 9. 3 months. Complications consisted of continued infection and partial or total necrosis of the flap. Digital fillet flaps were able to cover defects up to a combined mean size of 15. 6 cm 2. Coverage was found to be best for forefoot ulcerations. The flaps had limited donor site morbidity and provided full coverage of exposed vital and osseous structures that was able to withstand forces applied during weight bearing, The procedure is simple and straightforward, reducing operating time and the need for more complex soft-tissue reconstructive procedures...|$|E

Methods: We have reconstructed 28 cases of Wassel type III duplication thumbs, in which the duplicated digits were equal or almost equal in size by ablation of a radial digit. The extra thumb is osteotomized at the bifurcation level and excised except for the distal bone fragment supporting the nail bed and <b>fillet</b> <b>flap.</b> Meanwhile, the nail of the retained thumb should be reserved completely, and if the nail has relatively poor appearance it should be repaired by nail lengthening surgery. Eighteen cases were followed up for more than 3 years and were available for assessment using the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Hand evaluation form. The average age at follow-up was 5 years. The size of the nail and distal phalanx was measured to assess {{the growth of the}} thumb. Results: An average functional point was 12 points (maximum 14 points) and the cosmetic score averaged 3. 6 (maximum 4 points) after the assessment. Slightly small nails without a central ridge were deemed acceptable. Second revision surgery is seldom. Long-term results after surgical reconstruction for duplication thumbs were excellent, and all patients and parents were satisfied with the cosmetic and functional results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Free vascularized tissue {{transfer}} to preserve upper extremity amputation level is an uncommon procedure. The authors investigate {{the role of}} free tissue transfer in preserving both morphology and function of the amputated upper extremity, {{with the goal of}} facilitating prosthetic rehabilitation. METHODS: Thirteen patients who underwent microsurgical free tissue {{transfer to}} preserve upper extremity amputation level were reviewed retrospectively. These cases were selected from four centers: Duke University Medical Center (Durham, N. C.) University Hospital of Modena (Modena, Italy), Careggi University Hospital (Florence, Italy), and the University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany). Parameters that were evaluated included age, sex, cause of the defect, reconstructive procedure, structures to be salvaged, and functional outcome, among others. RESULTS: The cause of amputation was trauma in 92 percent of patients. Mean age was 32 years. In 31 percent of the cases, an emergency free <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> was used, and in the remaining 69 percent, a traditional free flap was performed. Structures/function to be preserved included pinch function to the hand, function of the elbow and shoulder joints, and skeletal length greater than 7 cm. Complications occurred in 38 percent of the cases, but the final goal of the procedure was achieved in all cases. A treatment algorithm for the management of the amputated upper extremity is presented. CONCLUSION: Use of free vascularized tissue transfer for preservation of upper extremity amputation level in well-selected cases facilitates prosthetic rehabilitation and improves residual limb functio...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} with {{peripheral sensory neuropathy}} frequently {{results in}} forefoot ulceration. Ulceration at the first ray level tends to be recalcitrant to local wound care modalities and off-loading techniques. If healing does occur, ulcer recurrence is common. When infection develops, partial first ray amputation {{in an effort to}} preserve maximum foot length is often performed. However, the survivorship of partial first ray amputations in this patient population and associated re-amputation rate remain unknown. Therefore, in an effort to determine the actual re-amputation rate following any form of partial first ray amputation in patients with diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy, the authors conducted a systematic review. Only studies involving any form of partial first ray amputation associated with diabetes mellitus and peripheral sensory neuropathy but without critical limb ischemia were included. Our search yielded a total of 24 references with 5 (20. 8 %) meeting our inclusion criteria involving 435 partial first ray amputations. The weighted mean age of patients was 59 years and the weighted mean follow-up was 26 months. The initial amputation level included the proximal phalanx base 167 (38. 4 %) times; first metatarsal head resection 96 (22. 1 %) times; first metatarsal-phalangeal joint disarticulation 53 (12. 2 %) times; first metatarsal mid-shaft 39 (9 %) times; hallux <b>fillet</b> <b>flap</b> 32 (7. 4 %) times; first metatarsal base 29 (6. 7 %) times; and partial hallux 19 (4. 4 %) times. The incidence of re-amputation was 19. 8 % (86 / 435). The end stage, most proximal level, following re-amputation was an additional digit 32 (37. 2 %) times; transmetatarsal 28 (32. 6 %) times; below-knee 25 (29. 1 %) times; and LisFranc 1 (1. 2 %) time. The results of our systematic review reveal that one out of every five patients undergoing any version of a partial first ray amputation will eventually require more proximal re-amputation. These results reveal that partial first ray amputation for patients with diabetes and peripheral sensory neuropathy may not represent a durable, functional, or predictable foot-sparing amputation and that a more proximal amputation, such as a balanced transmetatarsal amputation, as the index amputation may be more beneficial to the patient. However, this remains a matter for conjecture due to the limited data available and, therefore, additional prospective investigations are warranted...|$|E
