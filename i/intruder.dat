5|$|Some {{historians have}} claimed that had German <b>intruder</b> {{operations}} been maintained over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, which produced {{the nucleus of the}} huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue <b>intruder</b> operations, in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence of an effective German <b>intruder</b> campaign at this time may have given the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors attributable to the OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an <b>intruder.</b> The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no <b>intruder,</b> both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an <b>intruder</b> is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the <b>intruder</b> is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the <b>intruder</b> or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the <b>intruder</b> when the male is absent.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of types of <b>intruders</b> on the level and types of male aggressive acts {{at different stages of}} the egg guarding period in domesticated fighting fish (Betta splendens). The degree of aggressiveness was measured at two reproductive phases in response to three types of intruders: male, female and female that had laid eggs. The nest-holding males displayed the same level of aggressiveness towards <b>intruders</b> before and after the hatching of eggs. Male <b>intruders</b> elicited the highest number of aggressive acts followed by female, and mated female <b>intruders.</b> The highest incidence of gill cover erection, biting, and tail beating by nest-holding males was directed towards male <b>intruders</b> whilst female and mated female <b>intruders</b> were subject to lower and lowest incidence of these aggressive acts respectively. However, female <b>intruders</b> were attacked and chased most frequently and mated female <b>intruders</b> comparatively less frequently whereas male <b>intruders</b> were least subject to these types of aggression...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we design {{surveillance}} trajectories for {{a network of}} autonomous cameras to detect <b>intruders</b> in an environment. <b>Intruders,</b> which appear at arbitrary times and locations, are classified as static or dynamic. While static <b>intruders</b> remain stationary, dynamic <b>intruders</b> {{are aware of the}} cameras configuration and move to avoid detection, if possible. As performance criteria we consider the worst-case detection time of static and dynamic <b>intruders.</b> We model the environment and the camera network by means of a robotic roadmap. We show that optimal cameras trajectories against static <b>intruders</b> are obtained by solving a continuous graph partitioning problem. We design centralized and distributed algorithms to solve this continuous graph partitioning problem. Our centralized solution relies on tools from convex optimization. For the distributed case, we consider three distinct cameras communication models and propose a corresponding algorithm for each of the models. Regarding dynamic <b>intruders,</b> we identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the cameras locations to detect dynamic <b>intruders</b> in finite time. Additionally, we construct constant-factor optimal trajectories for the case of ring and tree roadmaps...|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer of night air defences in September 1943 did not prevent further appeals for the reinstatement of <b>intruder</b> operations. His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat of <b>intruder</b> operations and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} <b>intruder</b> operations were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was not to fall into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in <b>intruder</b> missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector of Night Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night <b>intruder</b> sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have <b>intruder</b> operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the <b>intruder</b> force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

5|$|Göring {{appointed}} a respected and experienced pilot, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Wolfgang Falck {{to develop a}} new organisation and consequently Falck founded Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1 or NJG 1). Within a year four more Geschwader (Wings) were founded; Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 (NJG 2), NJG 3 (NJG 3), and NJG 4 (NJG 4). All of these units were in existence by April 1941. In order to improve the management of the expanding night fighter force, the Erste Nachtjagd Division (1st Night Fighter Division) was established on 17 July 1940, commanded by Oberst (Colonel) Josef Kammhuber. An aggressive commander, Kammhuber founded the Fernnachtjagd, or long-range night fighter <b>intruder</b> force.

5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the <b>intruder.</b> If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill the <b>intruder.</b> Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E

5|$|To {{increase}} the toll on Allied bombers further, <b>intruder</b> operations restarted briefly in August 1943 and took place intermittently {{or on the}} initiative of single crews, since no organised Fernnachtjagd existed after October 1941. Success was still possible. On 22 April 1944 the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) 1st Bombardment Division and 3rd Bombardment Division were returning to England in darkening skies after a daylight raid over Germany. They were attacked by an element of Messerschmitt Me 410 bomber destroyers of Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51—Bomber Wing 51) over their bases. Over the next twenty minutes, 10 aircraft, nine of them B-24 Liberators, were shot down and 61 men killed {{for the loss of}} only two Me 410s and four airmen. The attack coincided with Operation Steinbock, a bombing and <b>intruder</b> offensive against Greater London and in response to the British offensive against German industrial cities, but the operation was aimed at the British capital rather than British bomber bases.|$|E
