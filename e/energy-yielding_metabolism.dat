50|$|<b>Energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> in {{erythrocytes}} {{depends on}} a constant supply of glucose from the blood plasma, where the glucose concentration is maintained at about 5mM. Glucose enters the erythrocyte by facilitated diffusion via a specific glucose transporter, at a rate about 50,000 times greater than uncatalyzed transmembrane diffusion. The glucose transporter of erythrocytes (called GLUT1 to distinguish it from related glucose transporters in other tissues) is a type III integral protein with 12 hydrophobic segments, {{each of which is}} believed to form a membrane-spanning helix. The detailed structure of GLUT1 is not known yet, but one plausible model suggests that the side-by-side assembly of several helices produces a transmembrane channel lined with hydrophilic residues that can hydrogen-bond with glucose as it moves through the channel.|$|E

40|$|The first {{stages of}} {{infection}} by phage T 4 may {{be divided into}} energy-dependent and energy-independent processes. Irreversible adsorption, unplugging, and initial exposure of the DNA terminus may occur at 4 degrees C, or at 37 degrees C in bacteria whose <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> has been poisoned. DNA injection into the cytoplasm needs higher temperatures and energy from the host cell. The nature of this energy requirements was deduced {{from the use of}} metabolic inhibitors. Our results show that T 4 DNA injection specifically requires the presence of a protonmotive force across the cytoplasmic membrane of the host. Moreover, the chemical gradient (delta pH) {{does not appear to be}} essential, but the membrane potential (delta psi) is required...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} {{lysozyme}} on the enterococcal cell differed markedly {{as a function}} of the ionic strength of the environment. In high ionic environments (I ≃ 0. 3), the traditionally slow lytic response and decrease in viability were noted. In a low ionic environment the majority of the cell wall was hydrolyzed, but cellular integrity was preserved and almost all cellular protein, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid remained with the lysozyme-cell complex. However, under these conditions, lysozyme inactivated <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism,</b> and a rapid extensive loss of viability was observed. Some other basic compounds without lytic activity on the cell wall also effected a substantial reduction in viability. The data suggest that lysozyme acts on the cell membrane to effect disruption of cellular metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann) kills all pines within its range and {{is among the}} most important forest pest species in the US. Using a specialized mycangium surrounded by gland cells in the pronotum, adult females culture, transport, and inoculate two fungi into beetle galleries during oviposition. These fungal symbionts, to varying degrees, exclude antagonistic fungi and provide nutrients to larvae. However, the mechanisms (e. g. secreted antibiotic chemicals or nutrients, proteins or pathways) by which this relationship is maintained are not known. Here we present the first global and differential proteome profile of the {{southern pine}} beetle pronotum. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis, tandem mass spectrometry, and database searches revealed that the majority of pronotal proteins were related to <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism,</b> contractile apparati, cell structure, and defence. The identified proteins provide important insights into the molecular and biochemical processes of, and candidates for functional genomics to understand mycangia and pronotum functions in, the southern pine beetle...|$|E
40|$|As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes {{available}} in educational contexts, {{it is important}} that educators experiment different ways to deal with ICT tools in the teaching -learning process at the University basic sciences level. The challenge is to integrate ICT throughout the learning subjects in order {{to improve the quality of}} the learning process to students. This paper presents the results of an experience using a Virtual Learning Management System (VLMS), named Constructore, applied in the Biochemistry discipline at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for undergraduate medical students.  Using Constructore, we developed a learning environment intended for integrating online activities and traditional course content. The course was focused on the integration of <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism,</b> exploring  metabolic adaptations in different physiological or pathological states such as starvation, diabetes and exercise. The course environment was structured with three modules, each of them presenting problem-based exercises to be answered after retrieving rele vant information in original scientific articles. Based on the analysis of  a semi-open questionnaire, the results provided evidence that the virtual environment stimulated students to critically read relevant scientific articles and to acquire skills to build and to integrate their knowledge through content association...|$|E
40|$|These studies {{demonstrate}} that soybean (Merr) roots and nodules possess an active system for fixing CO 2. The maximum rates of CO 2 fixation observed for roots and nodules of intact plants were 120 and 110 nanomoles CO 2 fixed per milligram dry weight per hour, respectively. Results of labeling studies suggest a primary role for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in CO 2 assimilation in these tissues. After pulse-labeling with 14 CO 2 for 2 minutes, 70 % {{of the total}} radioactivity was lost within 18 minutes via respiration and/or translocation out of nodules. During the vegetative stages of growth of soybeans grown symbiotically, CO 2 fixation in nodules increased {{at the onset of}} N 2 fixation but declined to a lower level prior to the decrease in N 2 fixation. This decrease coincided with a decrease in the transport of amino acids, especially asparagine, and an increase in the export of ureides. These findings are consistent with a dual role for CO 2 fixation, providing substrates for <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> and supplying carbon skeletons for NH 4 + assimilation and amino acid biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The energy-dependent {{exchange}} of intracellular Mg 2 + with extracellular Mg 2 + or Co 2 + is inhibited by colicin E 1 and, less strongly, by colicin K. Treatment with either colicin causes {{a net loss}} of intracellular Mg 2 +. This loss begins immediately in cells treated with colicin E 1, but in colicin K-treated cells the onset of Mg 2 + loss is delayed 1 to 10 min, depending upon the temperature and the multiplicity of colicin K. Both colicins differ from chemical inhibitors of energy-yielding metabolism; energy poisons block transport of Mg 2 + and Co 2 +, but both colicins increase passive permeability to Mg 2 + and Co 2 +. Inhibitors of <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> (and of Mg 2 + exchange) block the initiation of Mg 2 + loss by either colicin, but do not stop colicin-promoted efflux once it has begun. Colicin E 1 added before colicin K prevents the more rapid Mg 2 + efflux characteristic of colicin K-treated cells. Quantitative comparisons of the effects of colicins E 1 and K upon permeability to Mg 2 + and Co 2 + lead us to conclude that the two colicins are not identical in their mode of action...|$|E
40|$|Various {{physiological}} important {{activities of}} Mycoplasma gallisepticum were inhibited by the copper(I) complex of 2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline [Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3]. The <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> was inhibited because {{the conversion of}} pyruvate into lactate {{was found to be}} blocked by Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3, indicating a selective inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase. Also, the production rate of acetate and the rate of oxygen uptake by whole cells of M. gallisepticum appeared to be strongly decreased. Experiments with crude cell extracts showed an inhibition of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase by Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3 and an even stronger inhibition of NADH oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase by CuSO 4. No preferential inhibition of adenosine 5 '-triphosphatase and pyruvate kinase was found. Investigations on the influence of Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3 on deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis with growing cells of M. gallisepticum showed a selective inhibition of the incorporation of [14 C]thymidine into deoxyribonucleic acid. Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3 induced a decrease in the total amount of accessible sulfhydryl groups of whole cells of M. gallisepticum, indicating that the observed diverse toxicity of Cu(DMP) 2 NO 3 may be associated with the interaction of copper ions with protein sulfhydryl groups...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{was shown}} to possess lactate oxidase in {{addition}} to well-documented pyruvate oxidase. The activities of both H 2 O 2 -forming oxidases in wild-type cultures were detectable even in the early exponential phase of growth and attained the highest levels in the early stationary phase. For each of these oxidases, a defective mutant was constructed and compared to the parent regarding the dynamics of pyruvate and lactate in aerobic cultures. The results obtained indicated that the <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> in the wild type could be best described by the following scheme. (i) As long as glucose is available, approximately one-fourth of the pyruvate formed is converted to acetate by the sequential action of pyruvate oxidase and acetate kinase with acquisition of additional ATP; (ii) {{the rest of the}} pyruvate is reduced by lactate dehydrogenase to form lactate, with partial achievement of redox balance; (iii) the lactate is oxidized by lactate oxidase back to pyruvate, which is converted to acetate as described above; and (iv) the sequential reactions mentioned above continue to occur as long as lactate is present. As predicted by this model, exogenously added lactate {{was shown to}} increase the final growth yield in the presence of both oxidases...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for iodine, which are {{provided}} as Adequate Intake (AI). Iodine {{is essential for the}} synthesis of thyroid hormones. Through these hormones, iodine has an important role in <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> and many other physiological processes. Iodine deficiency is associated with an increased frequency of goitre and hypothyroidism in a population. The AI for iodine is based on a large epidemiological study in European school-aged children showing that goitre prevalence is lowest for a urinary iodine concentration above around 100 µg/L. From this study, a urinary iodine concentration of ≥ 100 µg/L has been accepted as the threshold indicating sufficient iodine intake of school-aged children. In the absence of similar suitable data for other age groups it is proposed that this threshold also be applied for adults, infants and young children. Taking into account urinary volume and an absorption efficiency for iodine of 92 %, an AI of 150 µg/day is proposed for adults. For infants aged 7 – 11 months and for children, AIs range between 70 µg/day and 130 µg/day. For pregnant women, an AI of 200 µg/day is proposed, taking into account additional needs due to increased maternal thyroid hormone production and the iodine uptake by the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid. The proposed AI for lactating women of 200 µg/day takes into account the existence of large iodine store...|$|E
40|$|Torulopsis pintolopesii is an {{indigenous}} yeast that colonizes the secreting epithelia in the stomachs of mice and rats. A wild-type strain of this microbe was isolated and identified. To attempt to learn {{characteristics of the}} yeast that are advantageous to it in colonizing its natural habitat in vivo, we examined some aspects of its nutrition and <b>energy-yielding</b> <b>metabolism</b> and some environmental conditions that influence its growth in vitro. The yeast appeared to be limited in the compounds it can utilize as carbon and nitrogen sources. It grew best at 37 °C and did not grow at 23 or 43 °C. It grew optimally at neutral pH but could grow aerobically at pH values as low as 2. 0 and anaerobically at pH values as low as 3. 4. As assessed by measurements of growth rates and yield coefficients, it grew better aerobically than anaerobically. When grown aerobically, it had a cyanide-sensitive system for taking up O 2 and tested positively for cytochrome c oxidase activity. A petite mutant strain isolated from the wild-type strain had a growth rate and yield coefficient when incubated aerobically that were {{essentially the same as}} those of the wild-type parent grown anaerobically. Likewise similar to the wild-type parent grown anaerobically, the petite strain, though incubated aerobically, did not take up O 2. Yeast-free mice associated with either the wild-type or the petite mutant strain were colonized at essentially the same rates and to similar final population levels by both strains. The yeast's capacity to respire may be of little advantage to it in its natural environment. By contrast, its abilities to grow best at 37 °C and to grow at low pH values are undoubtedly advantageous characteristics in this respect. The limitations in its carbon and nitrogen nutrition are difficult to evaluate as ecological factors in its colonization of the natural habitat...|$|E
