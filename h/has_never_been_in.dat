5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E

25|$|While the United States has {{no formal}} statute authorizing it, {{in some cases}} the Federal {{government}} has exercised self-help in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.|$|E
25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they {{try to come up}} with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E
500|$|While 30Ω {{cable is}} highly {{desirable}} for its power handling capabilities, it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> commercial production because the large size of inner conductor {{makes it difficult}} to manufacture. This is not the case with 77Ω cable. [...] Cable with 75Ω nominal impedance has been in use from an early period in telecommunications for its low loss characteristic. [...] According to Stephen Lampen of Belden Wire & Cable 75Ω was chosen as the nominal impedance rather than 77Ω because it corresponded to a standard AWG wire size for the inner conductor. [...] For coax video cables and interfaces 75Ω is now the near universal standard nominal impedance.|$|E

John Chapman of the Daily News stated, [...] "Perhaps Hammerstein and Rodgers are too gentlemanly {{to be dealing with}} Steinbeck's sleazy and raffish denizens." [...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing." [...] Billy Rose said of Pipe Dream, [...] "You know why Oscar shouldn't have written that?

500|$|Some reviewers {{classified}} Fantasy Black Channel {{into the}} British New Rave genre and musical scene. Others {{claimed that they}} could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and musician Gary Numan in the recording. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder commented that it contains several New Rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of PopMatters claimed that the band members [...] "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album is exciting and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to Klaxons and New Rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in.</b> Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members tried not to listen to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of The Skinny {{pointed out that the}} record is [...] "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of Queen and Bowie to the primitive electronics of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern house".|$|E

Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have a lot to talk about – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E

After {{a good start}} to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan. A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan {{in his first season}} in Italy, commenting, [...] "The decline of Ronaldinho hasn't surprised me.

2500|$|Many {{counties}} are named after their principal town, and the expected form {{here would be}} Durhamshire, however this form <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> common use. The ceremonial county is officially named Durham, however the county has long been commonly known as County Durham and as such is the only English county name to be prefixed with [...] "County" [...] in common usage – a practice more common in Ireland. Its unusual naming (for an English county) is explained to some extent by {{the relationship with the}} Bishops of Durham, who for centuries governed Durham as a county palatine (the County Palatine of Durham), outside the usual structure of county administration in England. Thus [...] "County Durham" [...] is a shortened form of [...] "County of Durham".|$|E

2500|$|While abstinence-only sex {{education}} is a controversial subject, the fact that complete abstinence itself (even within marriage) {{is the most effective}} preventative measure against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> dispute. What is in dispute is whether abstinence-only {{sex education}} actually succeeds in increasing abstinence. [...] Various analyses show that abstinence-based programs have little to no effect on age of sexual initiation, number of sexual partners, or rates of abstinence, use of condoms, vaginal sex, pregnancy, or sexually transmitted diseases. In-depth research has shown that the A.O.U.M policy has little influence over preventing students from engaging in sexual activity, is ineffective in reducing [...] "sexual risk behaviors" [...] and fails to improve the health outcomes of increasing contraceptive use and decreasing teen pregnancy rates.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Steve relives some {{repressed}} {{memories of}} {{a visit to the}} house with his drunken mother during which a ghostly Ellen Rimbauer appeared to him and called on Steve to aid her in continuing Rose Red's unending construction. Meanwhile, Emery suspects that Annie, not some [...] "spirit of Rose Red", is keeping the house sealed. Nick confirms Emery's suspicions, and then informs the group that Bollinger appeared to have hanged himself in the library. The group begins to speculate that Rose Red <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a dormant state, and that the mansion's supernatural powers are linked to Annie and Steve (whose psychic abilities become apparent only when he is in the house because of his familial connection to the property). Nick correctly guesses that Joyce brought the psychics to the house in an attempt to reawaken Rose Red rather than simply investigate it.|$|E
2500|$|General-purpose {{autonomous}} robots {{can perform}} {{a variety of}} functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles {{at different times of}} day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in.</b> [...] Thus, humanoid robots are really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their well-known environments.|$|E

[...] It was thought by many [...] experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial {{responses}} were skeptical. [...] For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said [...] "Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that that thing <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the ground". [...] Gradually, the argument for the legitimacy of the kouros' provenance fell apart. The letters tracing its history turned out to be fakes, referencing postal codes and bank accounts that did not exist until after the letters were supposedly written. However, experts to this day are unsure whether the kouros is authentic or not. [...] The museum notes that [...] "anomalies of the Getty kouros may be due more to our limited knowledge of Greek sculpture in this period rather than to mistakes {{on the part of a}} forger." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{full and}} clear {{knowledge}} of {{the circumstances under which}} the Peshitta was produced and came into circulation. Whereas the authorship of the Latin Vulgate <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> dispute, almost every assertion regarding the authorship of the Peshitta and its time and place of its origin, is subject to question. The chief ground of analogy between the Vulgate and the Peshitta is that both came into existence {{as the result of a}} revision. This, indeed, has been strenuously denied, but since Hort maintained this view in his Introduction to New Testament in the Original Greek, following Griesbach and Hug at the beginning of the 19th century, it has gained many adherents. As far as the New Testament writings are concerned, there is evidence, aided and increased by recent discoveries, for the view that the Peshitta represents a revision, and fresh investigation in the field of Syriac scholarship has raised it to a high degree of probability. The very designation, [...] "Peshito," [...] has given rise to dispute. It has been applied to the Syriac as the version in common use, and regarded as equivalent to the Greek [...] "koiné"(κοινἠ) and the Latin [...] "Vulgate" [...] (Vulgata).|$|E
