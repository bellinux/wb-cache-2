5|$|A long bar of Danish territories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> lack of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade.

Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but {{the intervention of the}} Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E

5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba. The MNC-K later formed a cartel with ABAKO and the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) to call for a united, but federalised, Congo.|$|E
5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages.

Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|Around 1000, Vladimir, still a boy, succeeded {{his father}} Petrislav as {{the ruler of}} Duklja. Petrislav is {{regarded}} as the earliest ruler of Duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary sources, which also indicate that he was in close relations with Byzantium. The principality consisted of two provinces: Zenta <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> Podgoria in the north. A local tradition has it that Vladimir's court was situated on the hillock called Kraljič, at the village of Koštanjica near Lake Skadar, in the Krajina region of southeastern Montenegro. Near Kraljič lie the ruins of the Prečista Krajinska Church (dedicated to Theotokos), which already existed in Vladimir's time. According to Daniele Farlati, an 18th-century ecclesiastical historian, the court and residence of Serbian rulers once stood in Krajina.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the capture of Jenin, all the main direct {{northern}} routes across the Esdrealon Plain, which the retreating Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies could have used, were now held by the Desert Mounted Corps. The 4th Cavalry Division controlled the Beisan area on {{the eastern edge of the}} plain after they captured both Afulah and Beisan, while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned the Afulah and Nazareth areas in the center and to the north, with the Australian Mounted Division holding Jenin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> patrolling the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Albanian {{independence}} movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> the Serbs in the north.|$|E

5|$|Ayla city (modern day Aqaba) in {{southern}} Jordan also came under Byzantine Empire rule. The Aqaba Church was built around 300 AD, {{and is considered}} to be the world's first purpose built Christian church. The Byzantines built 16 churches just south of Amman in Umm ar-Rasas. Administratively the area of Jordan fell under the Diocese of the East, and was divided between the provinces of Palaestina Secunda in the north-west and Arabia Petraea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> east. Palaestina Salutaris in the south was split off from Arabia Petraea in the late 4th century. The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> south-east respectively. It grows among tall shrubland or low woodland, mostly in the swales and lower slopes of dunes, and shows a very strong preference for deep white or yellow sand.|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
