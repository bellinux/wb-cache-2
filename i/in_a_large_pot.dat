5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot.</b> The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana {{crawfish}} {{are usually}} boiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> with heavy seasoning (salt, cayenne pepper, lemon, garlic, bay leaves, etc.) {{and other items}} such as potatoes and corn on the cob. Many differing methods are used to season a crawfish boil, and {{an equal number of}} opinions on which one is correct. They are generally served at a gathering known as a crawfish boil.|$|E
25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> with {{a large amount of}} water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E

2500|$|In Persian {{countries}} a sweet paste made {{entirely from}} germinated wheat is called Samanū (...) in Iran, Samanak (...) , (...) (...) or Sümölök (...) , which {{is prepared for}} Nowruz (Persian new year celebration) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> (like a kazan). A plate or bowl of Samanu is a traditional component of the Haft sin table symbolising affluence. Traditionally, women take a special party for it during the night, and cook it from {{late in the evening}} till the daylight, singing related songs. In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: Samanak dar Jūsh u mā Kafcha zanēm - Dīgarān dar Khwāb u mā Dafcha zanēm. (meaning: [...] "Samanak is boiling and we are stirring it, others are asleep and we are playing daf"). In modern times, making samanu can be a family gathering. It originally comes from the Great Persian Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Suksilgwa {{is made by}} boiling fruits, ginger, or nuts in water, {{and then}} forming the mix into the {{original}} fruit's shape, or other shapes. Gwapyeon is a jelly-like confection made by boiling sour fruits, starch, and sugar. Dasik, literally [...] "eatery for tea", is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. Jeonggwa, or jeongwa, is made by boiling fruits, plant roots and seeds in honey, mullyeot (물엿, liquid candy) or sugar. It is similar to marmalade or jam/jelly. Yeot is a Korean traditional candy in liquid or solid form made from steamed rice, glutinous rice, glutinous kaoliang, corn, sweet potatoes or mixed grains. The steamed ingredients are lightly fermented and boiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> called sot (솥) for a long time.|$|E

He wagged in the air a gay hand of salutation at sight of them, and of repression when they offered to rise to meet him; then, with an apparent simultaneity of action he gave a hand to each, pulled up a chair from the next table, put his hat and stick on the floor beside it, and seated himself.|$|E

50|$|Lanzer's {{principal}} {{fear was}} that something terrible {{was going to happen}} to his father and a lady friend (who later became his wife). His fear had grown out of an account he heard from a fellow army officer concerning about a Chinese torture method, <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot,</b> containing <b>a</b> live rat, was strapped to the buttocks of the victim, and the rat encouraged by a red-hot poker to gnaw his way out through the victim's anus.|$|R
60|$|The four crossed plants here average 29.68 inches, and {{the four}} self-fertilised 25.56 in height; or as 100 to 86. The {{remaining}} seeds were sown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> in which a Cineraria had long been growing; {{and in this case}} again the two crossed plants on the one side greatly exceeded in height the two self-fertilised plants on the opposite side. The plants in the above four pots from having been kept in the greenhouse did not produce on this or any other similar occasion many capsules; but the flowers on the crossed plants when again crossed were much more productive than the flowers on the self-fertilised plants when again self-fertilised. These plants after seeding were cut down and kept in the greenhouse; and in the following year, when grown again, their relative heights were reversed, as the self-fertilised plants in three out of the four pots were now taller than and flowered before the crossed plants.|$|E
6000|$|The {{kitchen was}} a white-washed room with rafters, to which were {{attached}} smoked hams; there were flower-pots on the window-sill, and guns hanging on nails, queer mugs, china and pewter, and portraits of Queen Victoria. A long, narrow table of plain wood was set with bowls and spoons, under {{a string of}} high-hung onions; two sheep-dogs and three cats lay here and there. On {{one side of the}} recessed fireplace sat two small boys, idle, and good as gold; on the other sat a stout, light-eyed, red-faced youth with hair and lashes the colour of the tow he was running through the barrel of a gun; between them Mrs. Narracombe dreamily stirred some savoury-scented stew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot.</b> Two other youths, oblique-eyed, dark-haired, rather sly-faced, like the two little boys, were talking together and lolling against the wall; and a short, elderly, clean-shaven man in corduroys, seated in the window, was conning a battered journal.

60|$|Some {{flowers on}} the self-fertilised plants in Pot 4 in Table 3/19 were fertilised with their own pollen, and plants of the eighth self-fertilised {{generation}} were thus raised, merely to serve as parents in the following experiment. Several {{flowers on the}}se plants were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously (insects being of course excluded), and the plants raised from these seeds formed the ninth self-fertilised generation; they consisted wholly of the tall white variety with crimson blotches. Other flowers on the same plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken from another plant of the same lot; so that the seedlings thus raised were the offspring of eight previous generations of self-fertilisation with an intercross in the last generation; these I will call the INTERCROSSED PLANTS. Lastly, other flowers on the same plants of the eighth self-fertilised generation were crossed with pollen taken from plants which had been raised from seed procured from a garden at Chelsea. The Chelsea plants bore yellow flowers blotched with red, but differed in no other respect. They had been grown out of doors, whilst mine had been cultivated in pots in the greenhouse {{for the last eight}} generations, and in a different kind of soil. The seedlings raised from this cross with a wholly different stock may be called the CHELSEA-CROSSED. The three lots of seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate on bare sand; and whenever a seed in all three lots, or in only two, germinated at the same time, they were planted in pots superficially divided into three or two compartments. The remaining seeds, whether or not in a state of germination, were thickly sown in three divisions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>pot,</b> 10, in Table 3/20. When the plants had grown to their full height they were measured, as shown in Table 3/20; but only the three tallest plants {{in each of the three}} divisions in Pot 10 were measured.|$|E

As the story goes, Dr. Creed Haskins of Mount Donum on the Nottoway River, a member of the Virginia State Legislature, took several friends on a hunting expedition. While the group hunted, Mr. Matthews, Haskin’s enslaved camp cook, hunted squirrel for the evening meal. Mr. Matthews slowly stewed the squirrels in butter, with onions, stale bread and seasoning <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> iron <b>pot.</b> When the hunting party returned, they were reluctant to try the new, thick concoction, but one taste convinced them to ask for more.|$|R

60|$|I {{was so much}} {{surprised}} at this great superiority of the self-fertilised over the crossed plants, that I determined to try how they would behave {{in one of the}} pots during a second growth. The two plants, therefore, in Pot 1 were cut down, and repotted without being disturbed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much <b>larger</b> <b>pot.</b> <b>In</b> the following year the self-fertilised plant showed even a greater superiority than before; for the two tallest flower-stems produced by the one crossed plant were only 29 4/8 and 30 1/8 inches in height, whereas the two tallest stems on the one self-fertilised plant were 49 4/8 and 49 6/8 inches; and this gives a ratio of 100 to 167. Considering all the evidence, {{there can be no doubt}} that these self-fertilised plants had a great superiority over the crossed plants.|$|R
