The platform {{is based on}} a multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS receiver which can be deployed either as a <b>fixed</b> <b>PC</b> receiver or as an embedded portable one.

40|$|We present liquid-cell {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (liquid-cell TEM) imaging of fixed and non-fixed prostate cancer cells (PC 3 and LNCaP) with high resolution in a custom developed silicon nitride liquid cell. <b>Fixed</b> <b>PC</b> 3 cells were imaged for 90 – 120 min without any discernable damage. High contrast on the cellular structures was obtained even at low electron doses (~ 2. 5 e - /nm 2 per image). The images show distinct structures of cell compartments (nuclei and nucleoli) and cell boundaries without any further sample embedding, dehydration, or staining. Furthermore, we observed dynamics of vesicles trafficking from the cell membrane in consecutive still frames in a non-fixed cell. Our findings show that liquid-cell TEM, operated at low electron dose, is an excellent tool to investigate dynamic events in non-fixed cells with enough spatial resolution (few nm) and natural amplitude contrast to follow key intracellular processes...|$|E

Compared with <b>fixed</b> <b>PC</b> applications, however, they are more difficult to evaluate. Of importance, it requires understanding the context of use through capturing and analyzing different types of data (e. g., conversations, gestures, movements) and re-representing them at different levels of abstraction.

A new approach to managing the complexity of collaborative analysis is presented, where an integrated physical and conceptual space have been co-designed to allow design teams to readily share and transfer their interpretations of data through preserving the contextual information. A case study is described showing how a collaborative analysis approach enabled small groups of designers to work together to interpret and further analyze a variety of data...|$|E

40|$|The rat adrenal {{pheochromocytoma}} PC 12 {{cell line}} {{is one of}} the traditional models for the study of neurite outgrowth and growth cone behavior. To clarify to what extent PC 12 neurite terminals can be compared to neuronal growth cones, we have analyzed their morphology and protein distribution in <b>fixed</b> <b>PC</b> 12 cells by immunocytochemistry. Our results show that that PC 12 cells display a special kind of neurite terminal that includes a varicosity in close association with a growth cone. This hybrid terminal, or "varicone", is characterized by the expression of specific markers not typically present in neuronal growth cones. For example, we show that calpain- 2 is a specific marker of varicones and can be detected even before the neurite develops. Our data also shows that a fraction of PC 12 neurites end in regular growth cones, which we have compared to hippocampal neurites as a control. We also report the extraordinary incidence of varicones in the literature referred to as "growth cones". In summary, we provide evidence of two different kinds of neurite terminals in PC 12 cells, including a PC 12 -specific terminal, which implies that care must be taken when using them as a model for neuronal growth cones or neurite outgrowth...|$|E

The twenty-six cases of PC (6 from large histological samples and 20 from needle biopsies) were equally distributed into low (less than or equal to 6) or high (greater than or equal to 7) GHG groups. The p 120 nucleolar protein immunocytochemical reaction was randomly expressed in large histological sections but uniformly distributed without gaps in needle biopsy sections. Only on the latter were quantitative values of PCNA/Cyclin (23. 2 in low and 45. 3 in high GHG), Ki- 67 /MIB 1 (13. 8 in low and 43. 3 in high GHG) and AgNOR (5. 0 in low and 7. 5 in high GHG) related to those of p 120 nucleolar protein (0. 8 in low and 3. 8 in high GHG). The values of all these cell cycle markers increased from low to high GHG of PC, all four reaching high statistical significance between the two groups (ANOVA - two tailed p < 0. 0001). The PCNA/Cyclin index showed a higher positivity than the Ki- 67 /MIB 1 index in PC with low GHG but not in PC with high GHG. In conclusion, paraffin embedded and formalin <b>fixed</b> <b>PC</b> needle biopsies exhibit a higher diagnostic PCNA/Cyclin than Ki- 67 /MIB 1 index for cases presenting differentiated features, whereas p 120 nucleolar protein detection seems to be a suitable marker of poorer outcome of PC...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{homologous}} {{coagulation factor}} X (FX), VII (FVII), IX (FIX) and protein C (PC) display striking {{differences in the}} carboxyl-terminus, which varies both in length and amino acid composition. This region represents a key determinant for the efficient secretion of FVII, <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC,</b> as demonstrated by nonsense, missense as well as frameshifted variants, either natural or artificial. So far, very {{little is known about}} FX, which is charactrized by the most extended carboxyl-terminal region. Our aim was to provide experimental evidence on the role of FX carboxyl-terminus on protein secretion and function by a deletion scanning approach. Methods A panel of recombinant FX (rFX) variants was created by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in multiple eukaryotic cell systems. Protein and activity levels were evaluated by ELISA, coagulant and amidolytic assays. Results An initial deletion scanning stemming from analysis of FX, FVII, <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC</b> primary sequences identified key residues in FX carboxyl-terminus mimicking the length of FVII (rFX- 482 X, FVII-like), PC (rFX- 480 X, PC-like) and FIX (rFX- 470 X, FIX-like), which is the shortest family member. In addition, five truncated proteins with intermediate length (rFX- 484 X, rFX- 479 X, rFX- 478 X, rFX- 474 X, and rFX- 472 X) were explored, together with truncated FX variants stemming from the sequential removal of single amino acids (rFX- 470 X, rFX- 469 X, and rFX- 468 X). Expression of this panel of progressively truncated (484 X- 468 X) rFX variants in HEK 293 cells revealed that the deletion of up to 21 residues in the carboxyl-terminus did not significantly affect secreted protein levels. However, a further one amino acid deletion from position 467 (rFX- 467 X) led to remarkable reduced secreted levels. These results were confirmed by expression studies in HepG 2 and BHK 21 cells. In contrast, chimeric rFX-FVII variants with swapped terminal residues showed severely reduced levels. The truncated rFX variants revealed normal amidolytic activity, suggesting an intact active site. Intriguingly, the transiently-expressed truncated variants, which included that resembling the activated FXbeta form once cleaved (rFX- 470 X), displayed remarkable or normal pro-coagulant capacity in PT- and aPTT-based assays, thus confirming the marginal impact of the carboxyl-terminus on functional properties. These observations are consistent with the virtual absence of patients with nonsense mutations affecting the carboxylterminus of FX as compared with those described in FVII, <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC,</b> mostly associated with deficiency. This supports the hypothesis that subjects with nonsense mutations in the FX carboxyl-terminus, so far never identified, would be asymptomatic. Conclusions For the first time we demonstrate that the FX carboxyl-terminal region downstream of residue 467 is not essential for secretion and provides a modest contribution to pro-coagulant properties. These findings, which might suggest an involvement of the carboxyl-terminal region in the divergence of the homologous FX, FVII, <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC,</b> help to interpret the mutational pattern of FX deficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] radar (CRr) is a recent radar paradigm that can potentially help drive aerospace innovation forward. Two specific platforms of cognitive radar used for target identification are discussed. One uses sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) in the receiver processing and {{is referred to as}} SHT-CRr and the other one uses maximum a posteriori (MAP) and is referred to as MAP-CRr. Our main goal in this article is to make a practical comparison between SHT-CRr and MAP-CRr platforms in terms of transmission energy efficiency. Since the performance metric for the SHT-CRr is the average number of illuminations (ANI) and the performance metric for MAP-CRr is the percentage of correct decisions (Pcd), a direct comparison between the platforms is difficult to perform. In this work, we introduce a useful procedure that involves a metric called total transmit energy (TTE) given a <b>fixed</b> <b>Pcd</b> as a metric to measure the transmit energy efficiency of both platforms. Lower TTE means that the platform is more efficient in achieving a desired Pcd. To facilitate a robust comparison, a transmit-adaptive waveform that consistently outperforms the pulsed waveform in terms of both Pcd and ANI is needed. We show that a certain adaptive waveform called the probability weighted energy signal-to-noise ratio-based (PWE-SNR) waveform outperforms the pulsed wideband waveform (i. e., flat frequency response) in terms of ANI and Pcd for all ranges of transmit waveform energy. We also note that the Pcd performance of SHT-CRr can be drastically different from the probability threshold (i. e., the probability value that is used to stop radar illumination for the purposes of classification), which is critically important for CRr system designers to realize. Indeed, this fact turns out to be key in accomplishing our goal to compare SHT-CRr and MAP-CRr in terms of transmit energy efficiency...|$|R

However, their carboxyl-terminal region displays striking differences in length and aminoacid composition. While this region of <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC</b> has been demonstrated to be essential for efficient biosynthesis and secretion, little is shown for FVII and FX. -AIMS- The main aim was to investigate the carboxyl-terminal region of FVII and FX as determinant of biosynthesis/secretion and/or function. In the study we took advantage of the characterization of i) a natural variant of FVII characterized by a nonsense mutation (R 402 X) leading to a slightly truncated protein (- 4 residues), and ii) natural anti-FVII inhibitory antibodies developed in a patient with an altered carboxyl-terminal region. The study was approached both by assays in patient’s plasma and by expression of the recombinant FVII variants in eukaryotic cells. To address the issue {{of the role of the}} carboxyl-terminal region of FX, a panel of progressively truncated FX variants has been expressed and characterized. -MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS - The main results of the studies can be summarized as follows. i) Demonstration that the truncated FVII- 402 X molecule, albeit poorly secreted, possesses an increased specific activity, which explains the association of the R 402 X nonsense mutation with an asymptomatic phenotype; ii) identification of an anti-FVII inhibitory antibody in a patient homozygous for a frequent FVII frameshift mutation (11125 delC) and data supporting the FVII carboxyl-terminal region as the main epitope of this antibody; iii) demonstration that the carboxyl-terminal region of FVII is essential for efficient biosynthesis and secretion, and the presence of an inverse relationship between the extent of the deletion of the carboxy-terminus and secretion levels. The deleted variants however possess a normal specific activity, thus not supporting a functional role for the very last residues of FVII; iv) demonstration that efficient secretion of FX, at variance from its highly homologous FVII, <b>FIX</b> and <b>PC</b> proteins, is not affected by short deletions (up to 21 residues) of the carboxyl-terminal region, which seems to have a functional role. Taken together these data indicate a differential role of the carboxyl-terminal region of FVII and FX, which might have contributed to divergence and evolution of these serine proteases from the common ancestor enzyme. -METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES- Production and expression of recombinant proteins, ELISA-based and functional assays have been exploited in this study to investigate the expression and the activity of different natural or recombinant variants of coagulation FVII and FX. ...|$|R

We show how these instanton configurations on open lattices can {{be taken into account}} when determining a few-couplings parametrization of the fixed point action. PACS numbers: 11. 15. Ha, 12. 38. Gc, 11. 10. Hi, 02. 40. <b>Pc</b> <b>Fixed</b> point (FP) actions [1] are classically perfect lattice actions, in the sense that their spectral properties are free of cut-off effects at the classical level. Moreover, they possess scale-invariant instanton solutions up to a minimu...|$|R
