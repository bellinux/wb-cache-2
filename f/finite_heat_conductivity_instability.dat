On the theoretical level we employ the Peierls transport equation for phonons and note that beyond a mere exchange of labels it admits nondegenerate phonon collisions.

The surface is exposed to a constant external heat flux and has a fixed internal temperature that is coupled to the outside <b>heat</b> fluxes by <b>finite</b> <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity</b> across surface. It is assumed that the temperatures are sufficiently high so that the thermal wavelength (a few microns at room temperature) is short compared to all geometric length scales of the surface patterns. Hence the radiosity method can be employed. A recursive multiple scattering method is developed that enables rapid convergence to equilibrium temperatures. While the temperature distributions show distinct dependence on the detailed surface shapes (cuboids and cylinder are studied), we demonstrate robust universal relations between the mean and the standard deviation of the temperature distributions and quantities that characterize overall geometric features of the surface shape.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a simple one}} dimensional stochastic model of heat transport which locally conserves both energy and momentum and which is coupled to heat reservoirs with different temperatures at its two ends. The steady state is analyzed and the model is found to obey the Fourier law with <b>finite</b> <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity.</b> In the infinite length limit, the steady state is described locally by an equilibrium Gibbs state. However finite size corrections to this local equilibrium state are present. We analyze these finite size corrections by calculating the on-site fluctuations of the momentum and the two point correlation of the momentum and energy. These correlations are long ranged and have scaling forms which are computed explicitly. We also introduce a multi-lane variant of the model in which correlations vanish in the steady state. The deviation from local equilibrium in this model as {{expressed in terms of}} the on-site momentum fluctuations is calculated in the large length limit. Comment: 20 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|When one is lead {{to think}} about a {{theoretical}} treatment of moving contact lines in the sole framework of classical physics, the first associations coming to mind are most probably those of singularities intractable unless "regularizing" effects, beyond the classical approach, are taken into account, such as the disjoining pressure or a slip at the wall. Here we show that, contrary to such preconceptions, no contact-line singularities arise, {{even in the absence of}} these regularizing effects, in a system consisting of a liquid, its pure vapor and a superheated substrate (of interest, in particular, in boiling applications). Furthermore, no thermal singularities typically associated with this system are encountered either, even in the absence of the thermal regularizing effects such as a finite rate of the evaporation kinetics or a <b>finite</b> <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the substrate. We consider, in the framework of the lubrication theory and a classical one-sided model, a contact line moving at a constant velocity (advancing or receding) and starting abruptly at a (formally) bare solid surface, the micro- contact angle being either equal to zero or finite. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} angular {{momentum}} transport in the radiative {{zone of the}} Sun and other stars is currently {{one of the most}} discussed in stellar astrophysics. A wide range of local and global instabilities acting in differentially rotating stars have been studied and incorporated in stellar evolutionary codes. In this thesis, I revisit two of the hydrodynamic processes that are thought to operate, namely the Eddington-Sweet (ES) circulation and a global motion induced by the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability, and investigate stellar models in which these mechanisms are suppressed. In particular: The data from helioseismology show that the upper radiative zone of the Sun is in near-uniform rotation, but they have a significant uncertainty. I discuss the possibility of patterns of differential rotation compatible with the constraint of perfect radiative equilibrium, which implies the absence of ES circulation. I show that this constraint leads to a set of ordinary differential equations for the stellar rotation profile, which are solved numerically. I find that these models can be quite close to uniform rotation, and compatible with the data from helioseismology. I investigate the dynamical stability of these models. It is shown that while a naive approach would suggest that the GSF instability would distrupt the rotation of these stars, this does not happen in reality. I present a study of the local stability of stratified, weakly magnetized, differentially rotating uids to non-axisymmetric perturbations with <b>finite</b> <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity,</b> kinematic viscosity, and resistivity. The models are found to be locally stable under rather general circumstances. Even if the molecular viscosity is very small compared to the <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity,</b> it suffices to suppress the GSF instability. I examine the onset of the GSF instability in the core of red giant stars, where, according to recent observations, strong differential rotation may be present. I derive constraints on the amount of shear necessary for the GSF instability to operate at different depths, and show that very strong shear is required. In general, the effectiveness of the GSF instability in transporting angular momentum is currently overstated. </p...|$|R
