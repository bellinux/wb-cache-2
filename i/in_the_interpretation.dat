5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of {{the genetic}} code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.

British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate.

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E
5|$|After 1919, {{members of}} the Provisional Government of India, as well as Indian revolutionaries of the Berlin Committee, sought Lenin's help for the Indian {{independence}} movement. Some of these revolutionaries {{were involved in the}} early Indian communist movement. With a price on his head, Mahendra Pratap travelled under an Afghan nationality {{for a number of years}} before returning to India after 1947. He was subsequently elected to the Indian parliament. Barkatullah and C.R. Pillai returned to Germany after a brief period in Russia. Barkatullah later moved back to the United States, where he died in San Francisco in 1927. Pillai was associated with the League against Imperialism in Germany, where he witnessed the Nazi rise to power. Pillai was killed in 1934. At the invitation of the Soviet leadership, Ubaidullah proceeded to Soviet Russia, where he spent seven months as a guest of the state. During his stay, he studied the ideology of socialism and was impressed by Communist ideals. He left for Turkey, where he initiated the third phase of the Waliullah Movement in 1924. He issued the charter for the independence of India from Istanbul. Ubaidullah travelled through the holy lands of Islam before permission for his return was requested by the Indian National Congress. After he was allowed back in 1936, he undertook considerable work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Islamic teachings. Ubaidullah died on 22 August 1944 at Deen Pur, near Lahore.|$|E

The model has two interpretations: an interpretation, agents are ordinary interactive small-step algorithm operating over states with a carefully chosen background. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> computational <b>interpretation,</b> agents are probabilistic polynomial time Turing machines working over strings. The common ASM model allows us to easily relate those two model {{with respect to the}} computational one: – an attack of a small-step algorithm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abstract <b>interpretation</b> is, when interpreted computationally, an attack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> computational interpretation; – a violation of postulates of small-step algorithms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abstract <b>interpretation</b> would break <b>the</b> security of an underlying encryption scheme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> computational <b>interpretation.</b> Introduction: Why Yet Another Formal Mode...|$|R
