40|$|Problem statement: Content of Cadmium, {{lead and}} copper in 26 bee honey samples from {{different}} places of Assiut governorate (south of Egypt) and three different botanical origins (Clover, Multi-flower and Citrus) {{in addition to}} four <b>edible</b> <b>molasses</b> samples from Egypt market were evaluated by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (DPASV) in Briton-Robinson buffer solution at pH ~ 2. 1, as well as atomic absorption spectrometry after wet digestion. Approach: The optimal deposition potentials and times {{for the detection of}} these metal ions in all sample solutions have been studied. Results: The concentration of each metal ion was determined by the standard addition method. The statistical parameters i. e., slope, standard deviation, correlation coefficient and confidence have been calculated. Conclusion/Recommendations: The results obtained using stripping voltammetry indicate that the average concentration of Cu ions ranged from 0. 085 - 0. 987 Î¼g g â 1. In addition, the average concentrations of Cd and Pb ions ranged 0. 001 - 0. 077 and 0. 006 - 1. 640 Î¼g g â 1; respectively. On the other hand, the average concentrations obtained using atomic absorption spectrometry of the same element mentioned above ranged from 0. 077 - 0. 991 Î¼g g â 1 for Cu; 0. 001 - 0. 087 Î¼g g â 1 for Cd and 0. 007 - 1. 650 Î¼g g â 1 for Pb...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} supplementation in female calves with flour of Gliricidia sepium leaves (GS) on partial and final body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) a study was under-taken in the “San Pedro Farm ” located in Zulia State, in a tropi-cal sub-humid forest environment of Venezuela. The data were analyzed by the least-square analysis of variance-covariance of The Statistical Analysis System, testing effects of treatment on 7 weaned Holstein crossbred female calves, 5 months old at initiation, and supplemented with a growing ration (2 % of body weight) : (a) supplementation with 100 % of feed concen-trate (TA) and (b) a mixture of 60 % corn meal + 40 % of dehy-drated GS flour + 50 g. /animal/day of complete mineral mixture (TR). The female calves supplemented with TA reached a higher BW (106. 65 ± 2. 51 kg.) and ADG (334. 61 ± 42 g/d) than the female calves fed with TR (BW= 96. 06 ± 2. 51 kg, ADG= 157 ± 42 g/d). The apparent cause for these results was the cutting age (5 months old) of the plant {{used to make the}} ration and the lower feed intake in TR. It is important to cut the GS plant green and very young (between 6 and 12 weeks old) because it has the best rate of digestibility at this stage. It is suggested prepare a ration with a minor proportion (30 %) of GS flour, adding <b>edible</b> <b>molasses</b> to improve the palatability.

40|$|Para evaluar el efecto de la suplementación en becerros con harina de hojas de Gliricidia sepium (GS) sobre el peso {{corporal}} al final del ensayo (BW) y ganancia diaria de peso vivo (ADG) en becerras, se realizó un experimento en la finca “San Pedro” ubicada en el estado Zulia (Venezuela), bajo condiciones de bosque sub-húmedo tropical. Los datos fueron sometidos a un análisis de Varianza-Covarianza y procesados por el sistema de análisis estadístico del SAS. Cada tratamiento estuvo compuesto por 7 becerras mestizas Holstein de 5 meses de edad suplementadas con una ración de crecimiento (2 % de su peso vivo) : (a) suplementación con un concentrado comercial (TA) y (b) 60 % de harina de maíz + 40 % de harina de GS + 50 g/animal/día de mezcla mineral completa (TR). Las becerras suplementadas con TA mostraron un mayor BW (106, 65 ± 2, 51 Kg.) y ADG (334, 61 ± 42 g/d) que las becerras que consumieron TR (BW= 96, 06 ± 2, 51 Kg, ADG= 157 ± 42 g/d). El BW y la ADG en el grupo TR fue bajo, siendo la razón aparente la edad de corte de las hojas de GS, lo cual disminuyó la aceptabilidad y la digestibilidad de la ración. Se recomienda realizar los cortes del material verde a procesar con rebrotes de plantas que oscilen entre las 6 y 12 semanas de edad. Se sugiere preparar la ración con menor proporción de GS (30 %), además de añadir melaza para mejorar la palatabilidad. 384 - 387 BimestralTo {{evaluate the}} effect of supplementation in female calves with flour of Gliricidia sepium leaves (GS) on partial and final body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) a study was undertaken in the “San Pedro Farm” located in Zulia State, in a tropical sub-humid forest environment of Venezuela.

50|$|In 1990, Sudan {{had only}} one {{operational}} deep-water harbor, Port Sudan, situated on an inlet of the Red Sea. The port had been built from scratch, beginning in 1905, to complement the railroad line from Khartoum to the Red Sea by serving as the entry and exit point for the foreign trade the rail line was to carry. It operated as a department of SRC until 1974 when it {{was transferred to the}} Sea Ports Corporation, a newly established public enterprise set up to manage Sudan's marine ports. Facilities at the port eventually included fifteen cargo berths, sheds, warehouses, and storage tanks for <b>edible</b> oils, <b>molasses,</b> and petroleum products. Equipment included quay, mobile, and other cranes, and some forklift trucks, but much of the handling of cargo was manual. There were also a number of tugboats, which were used to berth ships in the narrow inlet.|$|R
