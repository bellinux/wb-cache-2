5000|$|Some {{countries}} try <b>de-acidification</b> of {{the lakes}} {{by adding a}} suspension of calcium carbonate.It is also possible to stop the environmental acidification by reducing the use of SO2 (Sulfur dioxide), NOx and NH3 (Ammonia). Lowering {{the use of these}} substances is done by using low-Sulphur fuel, or flue gas desulphurization.|$|E
50|$|Washing and alkalization: Washing {{not only}} removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; {{it can also}} wash out acidic {{compounds}} and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an alkaline buffer to paper is sometimes recommended for <b>de-acidification.</b> Alkalization {{can be achieved by}} immersion or by spraying.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Farnsworth began making paper {{on his own}} after {{purchasing}} a used laboratory Hollander beater. He became interested in making paper while working at Daedalus Restoration restoring works of art on paper: [...] "I was terribly interested by what paper was all about ... Rag paper, as opposed to wood pulp paper, archival matting and framing... I started out cutting archival mats and pretty soon I was helping out in the bleaching and <b>de-acidification,</b> and before I knew it I was a partner there." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{prevalent}} Brittle Books issue facing libraries {{across the}} world is being addressed with a digital solution for long term book preservation. [...] Since the mid-1800s, books were printed on wood-pulp paper, which turns acidic as it decays. Deterioration may advance {{to a point where}} a book is completely unusable. In theory, if these widely circulated titles are not treated with <b>de-acidification</b> processes, the materials upon those acid pages will be lost. As digital technology evolves, it is increasingly preferred as a method of preserving these materials, mainly because it can provide easier access points and significantly reduce the need for physical storage space.|$|E
50|$|CCI also {{provides}} project-specific teams for conservation, scientific, and testing projects. Its Paper Group works with archives and libraries in preserving and restoring their collections. Research {{conducted by the}} Paper Group includes paper bleaching, enzyme use, washing, and <b>de-acidification.</b> The CCI also self-publishes a variety of materials related to its work. As well, each year it publishes the CCI, the Journal of the Canadian Conservation Institute. With a staff of about 80 to 100, the CCI has treated more than 13,000 objects for the heritage community, has published hundreds of scientific papers, and has distributed in excess of one million publications. The Institute responds to at least 2,000 requests for assistance annually. Working together in well-equipped, fully secure, climate-controlled laboratories, conservators, chemists, engineers, biologists, and other professionals handle projects ranging from information inquiries to complex treatments and research.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option to}} {{preserve}} brittle books is to perform paper splitting. This process dissects {{a book by}} its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually. Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - {{and a piece of}} alkaline paper is placed in between. The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process. However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung) offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting). They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes <b>de-acidification</b> washes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the <b>de-acidification</b> of dodecane was {{investigated}} using [DBU] based ionic liquid with thiocyanate [SCN] anion. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data for ternary mixture of {dodecane + naphthenic acid + [DBU-Hex][SCN]} were experimentally determined {{at a constant}} temperature and pressure. The ternary diagram shows that all the tie lines have a positive slope at all concentration of naphthenic acid, thus indicating that the ionic liquid is enough for the <b>de-acidification</b> of dodecane. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data was correlated using non-random two liquid (NRTL) model. An extremely good fit was obtained for all the tie lines using the NRTL model...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report some tests {{regarding}} the feasibility of nanodiamond {{to act as a}} cleaning/consolidation agent of papers and parchments. We carried out a series of treatments aiming to develop innovative approaches for <b>de-acidification,</b> cleaning and consolidation. Dispersions of nanodiamond have been used as <b>de-acidification</b> agents of ancient papers showing the ability to sensibly reduce the acidity of the paper without using any alkaline base. Similar dispersions have been used for cleaning processes and nanodiamond demonstrated an outstanding capability to clean ancient papers and parchments avoiding the use of any solvent and surfactant. Moreover interesting results were obtained by using nanodiamond as consolidation agent. In particular, artificial aging by UV exposition was appreciably contrasted when samples were preliminarily submitted to a treatment by nanodiamond. This outcome was demonstrated in papers and parchments by Raman spectroscopy analyses that evidenced the property of nanodiamond to be an excellent UV-scavenge...|$|E
40|$|The free {{fatty acids}} in waste oil with high acid value were removed and {{transformed}} into fatty acid methyl esters by the extraction-reaction coupled process. The <b>de-acidification</b> efficiency and esterification conversion in the extraction-reaction coupled process were studied and compared {{with those in the}} stand-alone extraction process and the esterification process, respectively. Compared with cross-current batch extraction, the <b>de-acidification</b> efficiency of the extraction-reaction coupled process was equivalent to that of seven equilibrium stages in the conditions of the oil/methanol mass ratio of 1 : 1 at 60 oC. Compared with the esterification process, the esterification conversion of the coupled process was 90. 3 %, which is much larger than 46 % in the esterification process at the reaction time of 32 minutes. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the extraction-reaction coupled process is a very effective and promising method for biodiesel production from oils having high acid value...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A {{potential}} {{method for}} the <b>de-acidification</b> of water-logged archaeological wood {{is through a}} treatment with alkaline nanoparticles. In previous studies, we have shown that strontium carbonate nanoparticles are especially effective in removing sulfuric acid from the Mary Rose timbers. In this contribution, we report {{the effect of these}} nanoparticles on other known sulfur compounds in the timbers. Overall, these effects are beneficial, yielding benign compounds and removing the possibility for the conversion to sulfuric acid...|$|E
40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} awareness on ecological process management {{the substitution of}} conventional processes for the <b>de-acidification</b> of vegetable oils has been focused by research, recently. The present study examines the mechanism of enzymatic <b>de-acidification</b> in degummed rapeseed oil by esterification of free fatty acids with an acyl-group acceptor (monoacylglycerol) utilizing an immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. As the experiments were performed in a solvent free system, first investigations comprise the exclusion of possible mass transfer limitations. The results obtained for the kinetically controlled system strongly indicate that the reaction seems to follow a multi-substrate Ping Pong mechanism. A slight competitive inhibition of the reaction by the acyl-group acceptors was observed during {{the determination of the}} effect of substrate concentration on lipase-catalyzed esterification. The free fatty acid content did not influence the activity of the biocatalyst within the ranges investigated. The kinetic parameters were determined, exhibiting that the lipase has a higher affinity towards the acyl-group acceptors (K(AGA) = 150 mM) than to free fatty acids (K(AGD) = 204 mM). The maximum reaction rate for the present reaction system was evaluated to be 41. 3 U/g protein...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a {{wide-range}} spectrochemical analysis of the degradation products from naturally aged paper. The samples obtained from wash waters used during the <b>de-acidification</b> treatment of leaves from a 16 th-century-printed book were analysed through NMR, IR, Raman UV/Vis, EPR and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and HPLC-MS and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. By these methods we also studied some of the previous samples treated by acidification (sample AP) and catalytic hydrogenation (sample HP). Crossing all the data, we obtained precise indications about the main functional groups occurring on the degraded, water-soluble cellulose oligomers. These results {{point out that the}} chromophores responsible for browning are conjugated carbonyl and carboxyl compounds. As a whole, we show that the analysis of wash waters, used in the usual conservation treatments of paper <b>de-acidification,</b> gives much valuable information about both the conservation state of the book and the degradation reactions occurring on the leaves, due to the huge amount of cellulose by-products contained in the samples. We propose therefore this procedure as a new very convenient general method to obtain precious and normally unavailable information on the cellulose degradation by-products from naturally aged paper. Shining light on paper browning: Cellulose degradation products have been extracted from leaves of a 16 th-Century-printed book. Broad spectrochemical characterisation led to the identification of the main chromophoric groups (see figure) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of forest and soil properties {{on changes in}} soil solution concentration upon a reduction deposition was examined for five forest-soil combinations with the dynamic RESAM model. Predicted concentrations decreased in the direction Douglas fir - Scotch pine - oak, due to decreased filtering of dry deposition and increased precipitation surplus. The {{influence of}} the non-calcareous sandy soils on the soil solution concentrations was small and caused by differences in nitrogen transformation rates. In all forest-soil combinations, a reduction in deposition level increased the pH and decreased sulphate, nitrate, ammonium and aluminium concentrations.

40|$|Energy {{dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence {{technique was}} used to study the elemental composition of some historical paper samples obtained from the National Library of South Africa. Six elements namely Fe, Cu, Mn, Ca, K and S were detected. It was found that older documents had higher concentrations of Ca and hence a considerable alkaline buffer than recent documents. It was also observed that the levels of Ca dropped significantly between 1800 and 1890 coinciding with the period paper making technology also changed. The concentrations of K and S also decreased around 1890. Iron remained fairly high and was detected in all the samples. Copper and manganese {{were found to be}} at very low concentrations compared to Fe. This research shows that Fe has the potential to impact negatively on paper permanency unless <b>de-acidification</b> is undertaken because of its relative abundance compared to Cu...|$|E
40|$|Objects {{composed}} of late 19 th-century materials are prevalent in museum collections throughout the United States. However, {{due to their}} age and frequent mix of incompatible materials, objects from this period, such as photograph albums, require special consideration and care {{in order to be}} properly preserved. To address this issue, research was conducted on, and a basic guideline created for, the care concerns and possible treatments for a variety of 19 th-century materials. The process of preserving a leatherbound, late 19 th-century photograph album from the San Francisco State University???s University Museum is provided {{as an example of how}} to care for one such object. Preventative care through proper environmental control is found to be the most critical aspect of preservation. However, since ideal conditions vary with the material, objects of mixed materials require carefully considered compromise of environmental controls.

40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF), {{the conversion}} of L-malic acid to L-lactic acid and CO 2, is a highly-important secondary fermentation carried out by lactic acid bacteria, typically Oenococcus oeni, during the vinification of most red wines and certain white wine styles. In addition to <b>de-acidification,</b> other significant impacts of MLF include influencing the organoleptic characteristics of wine and conferring a degree of biological stability towards further degradation of L-malic acid. Of the different factors that influence the development of lactic acid bacteria in wine (Wibowo et al. 1985, Henick-Kling 1993, Fugelsang 1997), the physico-chemical properties of wine (pH, concentrations of alcohol and SO 2, and temperature) are foremost in determining how well the malolactic bacteria will thrive and subsequently carry out MLF. Additionally, the ability of malolactic bacteria to grow and conduct MLF is highly dependent upon the nutritional status of the must/wine. In this regard, the availability of certain nutritional components required by malolactic bacteria can {{have a significant impact}} on the successful completion of MLF The Australian & New Zealand Grapegrower & Winemaker 65 April 2005 Bacterial nutrition – the key to successful malolactic fermentatio...|$|E
40|$|The V-ATPase is a proton pump {{consisting}} of a membrane-integral V 0 sector and a peripheral V 1 sector, which carries the ATPase activity. In vitro studies of yeast vacuole fusion and evidence from worms, flies, zebrafish and mice suggested that V 0 interacts with the SNARE machinery for membrane fusion, that it promotes the induction of hemifusion and that this activity requires physical presence of V 0 rather than its proton pump activity. A recent in vivo study in yeast has challenged these interpretations, concluding that fusion required solely lumenal acidification but not the V 0 sector itself. Here, we identify {{the reasons for this}} discrepancy and reconcile it. We find that acute pharmacological or physiological inhibition of V-ATPase pump activity de-acidifies the vacuole lumen in living yeast cells within minutes. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that <b>de-acidification</b> induces vacuole fusion rather than inhibiting it. Cells expressing mutated V 0 subunits that maintain vacuolar acidity were blocked in this fusion. Thus, proton pump activity of the V-ATPase negatively regulates vacuole fusion in vivo. Vacuole fusion in vivo does, however, require physical presence of a fusion-competent V 0 sector...|$|E
40|$|Neurotensin (NT) {{triggers}} signaling {{in human}} colonic epithelial cells by activating the G protein-coupled receptor, the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR 1). Activated NTR 1 traffics from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, and then recycles. Although sustained NT/NTR 1 signaling requires efficient NTR 1 recycling, {{little is known}} about the regulation of NTR 1 recycling. We recently showed that NT/NTR 1 signaling increases expression of miR- 133 α. Herein, we studied the mechanism of NT-regulated miR- 133 α expression and examined the role of miR- 133 α in intracellular NTR 1 trafficking in human NCM 460 colonocytes. We found that NT-induced miR- 133 α upregulation involves the negative transcription regulator, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1. Silencing of miR- 133 α or overexpression of aftiphilin (AFTPH), a binding target of miR- 133 α, attenuated NTR 1 trafficking to plasma membrane in human colonocytes, without affecting NTR 1 internalization. We localized AFTPH to early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in unstimulated human colonic epithelial cells. AFTPH overexpression reduced NTR 1 localization in early endosomes and increased expression of proteins related to endosomes and the TGN trafficking pathway. AFTPH overexpression and <b>de-acidification</b> of intracellular vesicles increased NTR 1 expression. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of GPCR trafficking in human colonic epithelial cells by which a microRNA, miR- 133 α regulates NTR 1 trafficking through its downstream target AFTPH.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn South Africa {{the green}} {{macroalga}} Ulva armoricana {{is the main}} species of macroalgae cultured. The species is currently the largest aquaculture (2884. 61 tonnes) product by weight with a corresponding capacity for biogas (CH₄) production. We have shown that biotransformation of U. armoricana to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is viable and economically feasible as a clean fuel. pH toxicity tests showed that U. armoricana {{can be used as}} a health index, under potentially increased CO₂ concentrations that can occur in IMTA carbon sequestration. We have shown sporulation to be the morphological response to environmental stress, which is indicative of chlorophyll degradation and a reduction in the photosynthetic activity of the alga. With the exception of Cadmium (Cd), the physico-chemical values obtained and the dissolved nutrient/heavy metals uptake by the alga all fell within the FAO/WHO permissible standards. Our Cd values therefore negate the use of these macroalgae for human consumption. We have also shown that U. armoricana can be used in eco-monitoring by playing a significant role in wastewater filtration and bioaccumulation. Nutrient utilization and proximate composition results show that African mud catfish (Clarias gariepinus) grow well on a protein-enriched Ulva diet, suggesting that enriched Ulva has the potential to be a successful fish feed. This thesis suggests among others, that South Africa could take advantage by being the first African country to propose specific standards for edible macroalgae as its successful research innovations and development provides a template for other African countries to further their aquaculture sectors. Additional benefits (bioremediation, ocean <b>de-acidification</b> through the capture of atmospheric and dissolved CO₂ during growth to assist in climate change mitigation) from Ulva farming activities bode well for the aquaculture industry...|$|E
40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} prices of petroleum fuels and potential shortages, {{have created a}} need for renewable fuels derived from organic waste products. The objective of this research project is to produce advanced multipurpose, continuous microwave biofuelslchemical reactors to utilise waste vegetable oils. The heat transfer efficiency of the reactor was studied using pure vegetable oils to establish the reactor design, operating temperatures and controls necessary to produce First Generation biodiesel by advanced microwave technology. Water modelling was used to scale up the reactors from 200 W to 1. 2 kW and then subsequently to 2 kW. Once the initial continuous reactor was optimised, the work was repeated using various grades of waste cooking oils provided by Longma Clean Energy Ltd. In order to achieve the required conversion to give 96. 5 % methyl esters, these oils needed larger quantities of both catalyst and methanol to reduce the viscosity of the crude oil. The system was then modified to carry out microwave assisted methanol extraction of free fatty acids, {{with the addition of}} a decanter to allow continuous phase separation. This process produced no glycerol, was energy efficient and the free fatty acids that were removed, were recovered in the methanol distillation unit. In the future, the waste frictional heat from the diesel engine could be used to grow algae, the waste heat from the exhaust gases could be used to heat the distillation unit and the carbon dioxide could be biofixated by microalgae. An industrial prototype 1. 2 kW microwave <b>de-acidification</b> unit has now been built at the Longma Clean Energy site at Hereford. There is a surplus of poor quality biodiesel glycerol that is currently regarded as a waste product. The novel continuous microwave unit which was developed from the biodiesel reactor has been used to acetyl ate the glycerol with acetone at below 50 °C to produce acetals for use as fuel additives. An atmospheric/vacuum fractional distillation column will be required to recover the methanol or acetone and to distil the acetal from the unreacted glycerol, which is then recycled. The technology developed can utilise any waste cooking oils, acidic seed oils or fats as biofuels for combined heat and power generation or to convert them to biodiesel fuels. This research work is the basis of an integrated, green, low carbon, microwave based refinery. 2 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
