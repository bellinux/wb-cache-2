The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E

Controlling Market Power and Price Spikes in Electricity Networks: Demand-Side Bidding In this paper we report experiments that examine how two structural features of electricity networks contribute to the exercise of market power in deregulated markets. The first feature is the distribution of ownership of a given set of generating assets. In the market power treatment, two large firms are allocated baseload and <b>intermediate</b> <b>cost</b> generators such that either firm might unilaterally withhold the capacity of its <b>intermediate</b> <b>cost</b> generators from the market {{to benefit from the}} supracompetitive prices that would result from only selling its baseload units. In the converse treatment, ownership of some of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>cost</b> generators is transferred from each of these firms to two other firms, so that no one firm could unilaterally restrict output to spawn supra-competitive prices. The second feature explores how the presence of line constraints in a radial network may segment the market and promote supra-competitive pricing in the isolated market segments. We also consider the interaction effect when both of these structural features are present. Having established a wellcontrolled data set with price spikes paralleling those observed in the naturally occurring economy, we also extend the design to include demand-side bidding.

40|$|In mobile pastoralism, {{strategies}} of mobility are highly heterogeneous within communities; some herders are frequently mobile {{and others are}} not. Moreover, pastoral mobility changes over time, especially after external intervention. Although changes in the {{strategies of}} herders affect and are affected by other herders, the interactions between herders with different strategies {{and the effect of}} changes in the external environment on their strategies have not been explicitly studied. We examined such interactions with a multi-agent model, simulating the herders' basic decision-making process, simplified rangeland ecosystem, and animal survival. The results showed clear co-existence of wealthy and poor herders at an <b>intermediate</b> <b>cost</b> of moving. The movement pattern revealed that an indirect interaction between wealthy and poor herders was the key to their co-existence, suggesting that very simple rules of pastoral mobility inherently contain a mechanism for the co-existence of wealthy and poor herders. At an <b>intermediate</b> <b>cost</b> of moving, the two groups have access to different pastures, thus reducing direct competition for poor herders and enabling their survival in drought years. Such interaction between herders suggests that any interventions in mobile pastoralist societies should take into account that impacts on the mobility of any one group can influence the entire social structure.

We present a tractable noisy dynamic coordination game with social learning and costs to delay. We show that this game has a unique monotone equilibrium. A comparison of the equilibrium of the dynamic game with the equilibria of analogous static coordination games explicates the role of social learning. The analysis is carried out for both endogenous and exogenous order of moves in the dynamic game. � In the limit as noise vanishes, social welfare is strictly ranked in these games, with the highest welfare achieved in the dynamic game with endogenous ordering. We demonstrate that exogenous asynchronicity is {{not a substitute for}} endogenous asynchronicity.

40|$|Understanding how {{risk and}} risk {{preferences}} affect {{the institutions of}} trade are questions of substantial importance. This paper provides a model in which heterogenous, risk averse agents can choose between trading at a centralized (intermediated) platform or in a decen-tralized (over-the-counter) market. The decentralized market is characterized by random matching and a non-degenerate price distribution. Thus, the benefits of participating in the decentralized market are uncertain. In contrast, prices at the centralized platform are non-stochastic, and consequently the centralized market eliminates risk for all the agents who choose to trade there. If agents are risk neutral, then the equilibrium market structure is imperfectly Walrasian in that high valuation buyers and low cost sellers trade at the centralized market while buyers with intermediate valuations and sellers with <b>intermediate</b> <b>costs</b> participate in the decentralized market and all other agents remain inactive. The same market equilibrium structure exists when the agents have CRRA utility and are moderately risk-averse.

40|$|The {{presence}} of unions and immobile labour are two {{key aspects of}} European labour markets. The model in this paper addresses {{the importance of these}} features for the location decisions of firms. We first of all show that, under these assumptions, the relationship between agglomeration and trade costs remains an inverted U-shaped curve as in the seminal New Economic Geography models. There is no agglomeration at high trade costs, the emergence of a core-periphery at <b>intermediate</b> <b>costs</b> and finally a reversion to dispersed manufacturing to take advantage of low wages at low trade costs. Secondly, and more importantly, we analyze how unionized wage setting affects the location of firms. We find that the degree of ‘centralization’ (at firm or sectoral level) and ‘regionalization’ (at regional or supra-regional level) is crucial. We show that wage setting at the firm level is the best policy to attract firms when trade costs are low, while wage setting at a more centralized level is most effective to attract firms when trade costs are high. Moreover, wage setting at the supra-regional level is beneficial for the already more agglomerated region and hurts the peripheral region. nrpages: 31 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Herbivory induces {{plants to}} emit {{volatile}} chemicals that attract {{enemies of the}} herbivores (bodyguards of plants). In this way, the plant acquires protection and the bodyguards gain food. These plant signals cause neighboring plants, not under attack, to release signals as well. We hypothesize that such ‘‘secondary’’ signals help to reduce damage from future herbivore attacks by the protection received from the bodyguards. By modeling we explore the conditions for such secondary signals to evolve. Three kinds of strategies are considered: plants of the first strategy always emit a signal, those of the second strategy emit a signal only when infested, {{and those of the}} third strategy emit a signal not only when infested, but also when a certain number of neighbors are infested (i. e. secondary signaling). When signaling is much less (much more) costly than damage from herbivory, the first (second) strategy will be favored by selection, whereas for <b>intermediate</b> <b>costs</b> the third strategy, i. e. secondary signaling, will evolve. However, secondary signaling will not evolve when the primary signals lure the bodyguards too effectively. This is because the undamaged plant gains associational defense when the infested individual is defending very well; therefore, the need for secondary signaling decreases. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
