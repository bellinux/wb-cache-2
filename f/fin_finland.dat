50|$|According {{to current}} research, an ancient meteor landed {{approximately}} 14.5 {{million years ago}} to the west-northwest of the city. This area is particularly rich in certain minerals, and a most diverse variety of minerals {{is to be found}} in the region. Copper was discovered on the surface no later than 1634 on the hills that now form part of the town of Kopparberg, itself, and stretch out to the north. Word quickly spread of the richness of the copper veins. As mining, particularly in the winter, was hard and difficult, and the Finns were acclimatized to hard work under cold conditions, they readily took to mining and refining this rich source of copper. The most famous and largest mine is called Finngruvan (<b>Fin</b> = <b>Finland</b> or Finns, gruvan = the mine), which lies just outside the town, proper, to the north. The veins were almost completely pure copper, with trace amounts of silver and gold.|$|R

30|$|The {{data source}} used is the Human Mortality Database, HMD (2018), which offers {{high-quality}} historical mortality data for industrialized countries (Barbieri et al. 2015). The HMD provides data from 39 countries, but the models are tested for low-mortality countries only. Eastern European countries have comparatively high mortality, characterized by breaks and upturns {{which are more}} problematic to forecast with common forecasting methods (Meslé 2004 b; Fazle Rabbi and Mazzuco 2017). We then selected the remaining countries with data available between 1960 and 2013 and which have a {{population of more than}} half a million people. The method is then applied to forecast the mortality of 18 industrialized low-mortality countries: Australia (AUS), Austria (AUT), Belgium (BEL), Denmark (DNK), <b>Finland</b> (<b>FIN),</b> France (FRA), Germany (DEU) 1, Ireland (IRL), Japan (JPN), The Netherlands (NLD), New Zealand (NZL), Norway (NOR), Portugal (PRT), Spain (ESP), Sweden (SWE), Switzerland (CHE), United Kingdom (UK), and United States America (USA).|$|R

In the area of digitisation, including non-textual and 3 -D-digitisation, a first step is to provide a snapshot of current activities and challenges in the KE partner countries. This paper is a synthesis of the information gathered in a questionnaire that was sent to 15 infrastructure institutions, e. g. libraries and also funders, within the five partner countries of Knowledge Exchange: Denmark (DK), <b>Finland</b> (<b>FIN),</b> Germany (GER), the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK). The paper is based on the answers provided by 6 respondents from four countries:  DK o Danish Agency of Culture (Henrik Jarl Hansen) o State and University Library (Tonny Skovgård Jensen)  GER o German research foundation, DFG (Franziska Regner)  NL o Royal Library (Hildelies Balk) o Leiden University Library (Saskia van Bergen)  UK o Jisc (Paola Marchionni, Peter Findlay) The absence of Finnish responses may be due to Finland participating in the recent Enumerate Core Survey II that also addressed digitisation.

40|$|Reduced {{susceptibility}} of Listeria monocytogenes to {{benzalkonium chloride}} (BC), a {{quaternary ammonium compound}} widely used in food processing and hospital environments, is a growing public health and food safety concern. The minimal inhibitory concentration of BC on 392 L. monocytogenes strains from Switzerland (CH) and <b>Finland</b> (<b>FIN)</b> was determined. Within this strain collection, benzalkonium chloride resistance was observed in 12. 3 % (24 / 195) of Swiss and 10. 6 % (21 / 197) of Finnish strains. In both countries, the highest prevalence of BC-resistant strains (CH: 29. 4 %; FIN: 38. 9 %) was detected among serotype 1 / 2 c strains. Based on PCR analysis, genes coding for the qacH efflux pump system were detected {{for most of the}} BC-resistant strains (CH: 62. 5 %; FIN: 52. 4 %). Some Swiss BC-resistant strains harbored genes coding for the bcrABC(16. 7 %) efflux pump system, while one Finnish BC-resistant strain harbored the emrE gene previously only described among BC-resistant L. monocytogenes strains from Canada. Interestingly, a subset of BC-resistant strains (CH: 5 / 24, 20. 8 %; FIN: 9 / 21, 42. 8 %) lacked genes for efflux pumps currently known to confer BC resistance in L. monocytogenes. BC resistance analysis in presence of reserpine showed that the resistance was completely or partially efflux pump dependent in 10 out of the 14 strains lacking the known BC resistance genes. Sequence types 155 and ST 403 were over-representated among these strains suggesting that these strains might share similar but yet unknown mechanisms of BC resistance...|$|R
40|$|Background: So far {{no studies}} have been {{conducted}} on the issue of comparability of rehabilitation treatment profiles and patient characteristics across countries. These aspects might have implications for the feasibility of treating patients abroad but also for the comparison of treatment outcome on an international level. Objective: This study attempts to compare the patient characteristics and treatment profiles in six European countries of two rehabilitation categories (chronic low back pain (CLBP) and stroke) and to reveal possible consequences for international treatment and multi-centre studies. Design: Cross-sectional study comparing demographic variables, treatment profiles, generic health (SF- 36) and disabilities (RDQ for CLBP and the Barthel index for stroke) in six European countries. Subjects: 255 patients with CLBP and 246 patients with stroke, treated in 36 different institutions in Austria (AUT), <b>Finland</b> (<b>FIN),</b> Germany (GER), Ireland (IR), Italy (IT) and The Netherlands (NL). Results: The treatment profiles of CLBP patients show marked differences between countries and three categories of treatment can be distinguished: (a) predominant physiotherapy (IR, IT), (b) all disciplines equally provided (NL, GER, AUS) and (c) treatment concentrated in four disciplines (FIN). Striking differences are also found for patient characteristics, characterised by in particular the younger and more disabled Dutch patients and the older and less disabled (mostly female) Italian patients. International stroke rehabilitation was more similar between countries; however, a few differences in patient characteristics were found which again could mostly be ascribed to the Dutch and Italian patients. Conclusion: International treatment and outcome assessment of CLBP patients is not possible unless standardisation is considered of treatment content and patient selection. For stroke treatment international traffic and multi-centre outcome assessment might be more feasible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The four Nordic countries: Denmark (DK), <b>Finland</b> (<b>FIN),</b> Norway (NO) and Sweden (SE), {{all have}} {{national}} databases in which mainly records of treated animals are maintained. Recently, the completeness of locomotor disorder records in these databases has been evaluated using farmers’ recordings {{as a reference}} level. The objective {{of the present study}} was to see how previous estimates of completeness figures are affected by the criteria determining whether a recording in the database is to be judged correct. These demands included date of diagnosis and disease classification. In contrast with the previous study, a period of time between the date of disease recording in the database and by the farmer was allowed. Further, the calculations were brought to bear on individual locomotor diagnoses instead of a common locomotor disease complex code. Methods Randomly selected dairy herds (≥ 15 cows) were invited to participate. During two 2 -month periods in 2008 the farmers recorded the diseases they observed on the farm and their recordings constituted a farmer database (FD). These recordings were compared to disease recordings in the National Databases (ND). Earlier calculations of completeness for locomotor complex cases assuming an exact match on date were compared with ± 7 [*]day and ± 30 [*]day discrepancies calculated in this study. Results The farmers in DK, FIN, NO and SE recorded 426, 147, 97 and 193 locomotor disorders, respectively. When a window of ± 7 [*]days was allowed there was a relative increase in completeness figures lying in the range of 24 – 100 %. Further increases were minor, or non-existent, when the window was expanded to ± 30 [*]days. The same trend was seen for individual diagnoses. Conclusion In all four of the Nordic countries a common pattern can be observed: a further increase in completeness occurs when individual locomotor diagnoses recorded by the farmer are permitted to match any locomotor diagnosis recorded in the ND. Completeness increased when both time span and different diagnoses within the locomotor complex were allowed. </p...|$|R
