40|$|Electronic billing and payment {{systems are}} about {{to change the way}} many {{households}} pay their monthly bills.

Several factors, however, could slow down the widespread use of electronic billing and payment, including customer resistance to change, unequal access to technology, and consumer privacy concerns.

The survey instrument was designed to gain insight into duration and nature of online presence among banks in Pakistan; motivation towards a long-term online strategy; progress made, and the barriers and the effect of competition. We found that although in its nascent phase about 44 % of the banks indicated that they currently had a website. Whereas, only 20 % of the banks that participated in the survey currently offered online transactions capabilities. Around 79 % of the banks have only “informational ” websites.

Although the REH and adaptive learning theory have been applied in many non-technology contexts, this research is among the first that applies rational expectations and adaptive learning theory to issues related to technology adoption. The proposed theory allows us to examine technology adoption settings where multiple parties seek to align their expectations of future value prior to making a decision to adopt. It also {{takes into account the}} learning and information sharing that generally occurs in the marketplace between multiple parties that can further influence clustered adoption and the overall adoption rate. In our effort to test our new theory, we construct several hypotheses that allow us to examine issues associated with information technology adoption that involves multiple parties (multi-partite technology adoption) and strong network externalities.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> <b>presentment</b> and payment (EBPP) technology. EBPP continues to grow and will become a multibillion dollar e-commerce industry. The technology adoption configuration {{in this context is}} quite interesting because it involves four stakeholders: billers, bill consolidators, banks, and consumers. Banks and bill consolidators compete to act as an intermediary between billers and consumers. Network externalities play a significant role: the more billers that adopt the technology, the more consumers are willing to use the services. Our analysis is based on the welfare economics concept of finding the socially optimum adoption configuration and the resulting adoption pattern in a market with sponsored technologies. The results show that due to network externalities, billers are more likely to adopt the existing technology early, though the next technology might be superior to the current one. When the higher costs of early adoption are taken into account, the model shows that billers are more willing to wait, ceteris paribus. Our results also show that anticipation of a new and better, but compatible, technology might cause billers to wait, depending on what benefits they expect by adopting early, and how much cost they anticipate to incur upgrading their technology later...|$|E

Based on the interview and a survey we proposed a framework of adoption and diffusion of EBPP services. The results indicated that Incentives to the Banks; Incentives to the Individual Customers; Incentives to the Corporate Consumers; Governance and Legal Framework, and Security are the most important. Based on the framework, we studied in-depth the managerial, technical, security, legal, and financial aspects of HSBC’s implementation and operation of EBPP.

However, to leverage these potential benefits, organizations must be able to transform ineffective operating procedures and explore alternative implementations of EDI. The project reported here illustrates how a major Fortune 500 corporation was able to meet the challenge of extending their EDI utilization using specific cycle time reduction techniques. Specifically, they identified various means to reduce the cycle time for <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> <b>presentment</b> and payment that should result in improved customer service, increased cost savings, and enhanced revenue. Many organizations consider Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technologies to be a valuable strategic tool. If implemented correctly, EDI can provide significant benefits in managing business partner relationships (Riggins and Mukhopaphyay 1994). Benefits include increased efficiencies of operation, reduced transaction costs, and improved customer satisfaction (Johnson and Vitale 1988). Unfortunately, EDI utilization can also introduce new problems into the organi-zation. Specifically, the requirements associated with paperless processes can {{have a major impact on}} organizational procedures and controls (Scala and McGrath 1993). Furthermore, traditional implementations of EDI using proprietary value-added networks have proven to be quite cost prohibitive for many small to medium sized customers (Williams and Frolick 2001). Nevertheless, organizations continue to focus on extending their use of EDI technologies to achieve competitive advantage. This article reports the results of a join...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} {{identify}} the key factors that influence the acceptance of an aggregated <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> <b>presentment</b> and payment solution in South Africa. As technology acceptance models are primarily developed and validated in developed countries, a new model had to be respecified to fit the South African context. Two constructs, namely perceived usefulness from the Technology Acceptance Model and a new construct “confidence”, including antecedents, were formulated from our literature review. Using a research instrument of an online survey, we measured the 81 responses received from a judgemental sample of South African internet users. The data was analysed by using linear regression analysis to test the model {{as well as individual}} hypotheses. Our respecified model was found to be highly significant providing 31, 2 % explanatory power to influence adoption. The confidence construct was only marginally significant and may be an area for future research. The key themes emanating from our research indicates that consumers who value “time savings” and are “self-identified adopters” are likely to be the early adopters of EBPP. Concern for privacy and the perceived advantage to current methods of paying bills online are eminent; however, a majority (96, 3 %) of the respondents indicated a willingness to adopt EBPP with 58 % indicating regular levels of usage.
