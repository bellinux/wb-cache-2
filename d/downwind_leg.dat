25|$|Race six {{followed}} a familiar refrain, with Oracle {{ahead at the}} start and holding {{that lead to the}} bottom of the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> After rounding the mark 12 seconds behind, Team New Zealand once again took over sailing into the wind. The highest number of tacks seen thus far was unable to prevent the Kiwis from gaining 55 seconds during the third leg, and the 44 second lead at the top mark was extended to 47 seconds at the finish.|$|E
25|$|Team New Zealand led off {{the line}} for race fifteen, but the leeward {{position}} of the Oracle Team USA boat allowed them to round the reach mark first. A huge <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> from the American boat saw them round the leeward gate 1 minute ahead of the Kiwis. They did not give up, {{and were able to}} cut Oracle's lead in half by the windward gate, but were unable to make {{up the rest of the}} gap. Oracle had their best day on the water yet, winning both races to bring the score to 5-8.|$|E
25|$|This {{change in}} {{technique}} for downwind racing has changed most dinghy racing {{to be much}} more competitive on the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> and resulted in a change of the international course shape from a traditional triangle to a trapezoid giving greater opportunity for increased upwind and straight <b>downwind</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Formula boards have {{excellent}} upwind and downwind ability, {{but are not}} as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and <b>downwind</b> <b>legs,</b> or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.|$|R
5000|$|The Windglider used a 6.5 m2 sail but {{the use of}} {{a harness}} was not permitted. The {{daggerboard}} weighed around 4 kg and was carried over the sailor's shoulder during the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs.</b> The 1984 Olympic course of nine nautical miles put a premium on the competitors strength and fitness.|$|R
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|Race three {{initially}} {{looked good}} for Oracle as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead {{for the first}} <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the upwind third leg. The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on port tack within three boat lengths of the boundary. Oracle was forced to tack away due to the boundary rights, {{even though they were}} on starboard which would have otherwise have had right of way. The 29 second lead at the top mark was held by the Kiwis {{all the way to the}} finish, crossing 28 seconds ahead of the Americans to go 0–3 up.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} race sixteen was delayed for 30 minutes while the race {{committee}} {{waited for the}} wind to increase. Emirates Team New Zealand took the leeward position at the start line but Oracle Team USA got onto its foils and sailed over {{on top of the}} Kiwis to lead by five seconds at the reach mark. At the second mark the New Zealand team were 13 seconds behind Oracle and after a tacking duel upwind to the third mark Oracle was able to get the wind advantage for the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b> Oracle sailed conservatively downwind gaining a 21-second lead for the fourth mark, which they extended to 33 seconds by finish line. Oracle stayed alive 6–8 and trimmed the Kiwis' lead to just 2 points. It was their 5th straight win.|$|E

50|$|The A-Class {{design has}} over time converged {{to a single}} sail rig using a {{lightweight}} carbon mast of about 9 meters length and using lightweight pentex or Kevlar sailcloth. The hulls and beams are often made out of carbon fibre as well. This single sail rig (just a mainsail) allows these boats to truly excel when sailing upwind. Their lightweight and time tested sailing techniques make these boats very fast on reaches and <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> as well. They were often unbeatable on the race course and only {{with the introduction of}} the asymmetic spinnaker on other catamarans have they lost this position a little bit.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the first}} race was raced in light airs, {{thought to be}} Kookaburra's best conditions, Stars & Stripes 87 reached the first mark ahead. She led {{throughout}} the race, never being seriously threatened. This first test between the two boats was a harbinger of more to come. It was clear Stars & Stripes 87 had the edge in sailing to windward, even in light air, and could hold her own on the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs.</b> The Fremantle Doctor returned after the first match, and with the heavy winds came an even greater difference in boat speeds. The Aussies gave a great effort, but they simply lacked the boat speed to stay with Stars & Stripes 87, which showed a consistent twenty second advantage on each beat to windward. She won the series four races to nil.|$|R
25|$|Team New Zealand won race ten by 16 seconds, in {{what was}} widely {{reported}} {{as one of the}} most exciting America's Cup races of all time. Barker looked to have been left behind by Spithill at the startline, but just managed to hold an overlap as the AC72's entered the three boat length circle at the reach mark. Team New Zealand took the 3 second lead, and increased it to 11 at the second mark. Oracle again showed their new competitiveness during the upwind beat, and the lead changed three times. As the boats approached the top mark on split tacks, Barker cleverly slowed the boat, and then aimed down to pass under Oracle at speed. The top mark split was only 1 second as Oracle rounded in front of the shore, and Aotearoa rounded the other mark. With the race still too close to call during the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> Spithill made the call to dip behind Team New Zealand rather than jibe. The gap almost instantly became 100 metres. Barker was able to hold this lead to the finish to take the series to 1–7.|$|E
2500|$|Team New Zealand had port entry advantage, {{and were}} able to convert this into the leeward {{position}} at the start line and a lead around the reach mark. Oracle had a moment where both bows dipped into the water, slowing them to open some separation between the two boats. The first <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> saw both boats foiling at around , at times well within [...] of each other. Team New Zealand took the lead into the upwind third leg, but were unable to hold it.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe, {{aircraft}} usually {{join the}} pattern at a 45° {{angle to the}} <b>downwind</b> <b>leg,</b> {{in the beginning of}} the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{aircraft}} usually depart {{the pattern}} either straight {{out along the}} runway heading, with a 45° turn {{in the direction of}} (or against) the crosswind <b>leg,</b> <b>downwind,</b> or with a 45° turn away from downwind.|$|R
50|$|The schooners (and {{occasionally}} sloops) {{would leave}} St. Martin {{on the first}} or second of January. The ships would leave en masse, on a downwind run to Santa Domingo and La Romana. (The wind typically blows from the east in the West Indies.) On these <b>downwind</b> <b>legs,</b> the crew of each vessel would often attempt to outrun each other to alleviate the boredom of a journey that often took four days. The return trip in July, being a beat directly to windward, was difficult and long, taking up to twenty-one days. It was also more competitive, with much debate on tactics and weight distribution on each ship. Some even breached international navigation rules and switched their starboard and port lights in attempt to fool their opponents. In addition to being a source of entertainment, the schooners that could outrun their opponents were able to deliver their loads home faster. Those with a reputation for speed were able to charge more per passenger, and were usually guaranteed a full load of passengers. Even after the schooners had been derigged and the crews turned to fishing, their passion for racing and sailing experience carried on into the smaller fishing craft.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{implementation}} of a kite modelling approach into {{6 degrees of freedom}} sailboat dynamic simulator is introduced. This enables an evaluation of kite performance in comparison with classical rig sailing. A zero-mass model was used to model kite forces. Influence of the wind gradient was properly taken into account leading to significant modifications in the calculation of the relative wind. The modelling was performed with experimental aerodynamic characteristics. An optimization was done to determine the best kite flight trajectory in terms of performance. Validation steps of the sail yacht simulator were performed for a classical rig on the example of an 8 m one design yacht. The experimental set-up is described and validation results are discussed. Particularly, a wind mesh was used, based on measurements made at four different locations of the navigation spot. Additionally boat motions were recorded by high resolution GPS and inertial unit systems. Speed polar diagram results, reached by kite propulsion, were predicted versus true wind angle. At last a comparison was made for upwind and <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> in sea trials conditions, between simulations with the classical rig and the kite. It is shown that the boat towed by kite would achieve much better sailing performance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first two}} races were similar, with Stars & Stripes {{going out to}} an early lead in the opening beat to the first {{windward}} mark, and then holding that lead throughout {{the remainder of the}} rest, holding ground on the <b>downwind</b> <b>legs</b> and extending it on the beats. The third race started out much as the previous two, with both boats taking a long tack out to the left hand side of the course in what Dennis Conner termed a [...] "speed test". Stars & Stripes 87 rounded the first windward mark 26 seconds ahead, and that is when trouble started. The snap shackle failed causing the spinnaker to drop into the sea. The New Zealanders closed the gap, gibing back and forth across Conner's stern until they achieved what they were looking for, an inside overlap on the bottom mark. With right of way KZ-7 was able to slide ahead on the turn about the mark. Once there the New Zealanders proved a difficult boat to get past. On the second beat to windward they kept the American boat at bay with a tight cover. No room was available to get by on the reaching legs. But the third beat was one for the records books. Conner threw 55 tacks at the Dickson and his boat plus two false tacks in an effort to break free. The New Zealanders covered them all {{in one of the most}} exhausting and tense beats to windward in America's Cup history.|$|R

The Kiwis closed the gap, gibing back and forth across Conner's stern until they achieved what they were looking for, an inside overlap on the bottom mark. Having gained right of way the Kiwis were able to slide ahead on the turn at the mark. Once there the Kiwis proved a very difficult boat to get past. On the second beat to windward they covered every move of the blue hulled boat, keeping Conner at bay with a tight cover. The two reaching legs did not allow room to get around a competitor, which brought the boats to the third beat to windward. This was one for the record books. Conner threw 55 tacks along with two false tacks in an effort to break away. The New Zealanders covered each move {{in one of the most}} exhausting and tense beats to windward in America's Cup history.

50|$|A {{technique}} {{used to make}} these boats ultra-light is balsa wood cored hulls. A criticism is that the boats need to be reefed in relatively lower winds, when heading to the wind.

50|$|This kind of race is most {{commonly}} run over {{one or more}} laps of a triangular course marked {{by a number of}} buoys. The course starts from an imaginary line drawn from a 'committee boat' to the designated 'starting' buoy or 'pin'. A number of warning signals are given telling the crews exactly how long until the race starts. The aim of each crew is to cross the start line at full speed exactly as the race starts. A course generally involves tacking upwind to a 'windward' marker or buoy. Then bearing away onto a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> to a second jibe marker. Next another jibe on a second <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> to the last mark which is called the 'downwind mark' (or 'leeward mark'). At this mark the boats turn into wind once again to tack to the finish line.|$|E
5000|$|Fast aircraft, {{for example}} {{military}} jets, may enter the pattern with a run-and-break (in the US, overhead maneuver or overhead break).

5000|$|The {{standard}} circuit {{begins with a}} roll on the runway until the aircraft rotates (nose pitches up), a climb to 500 feet above runway/field elevation (AGL), a right or left climbing turn (depending on making either right hand or left hand circuits) to a course perpendicular to the runway, continuing to gain altitude to TPA (traffic pattern altitude) (typically 1000 feet AGL), followed by another right or left turn for a <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> parallel to the runway, maintaining TPA. During the <b>downwind</b> <b>leg</b> the pilot performs pre-landing checks, contacts the control tower requesting a full-stop landing, a touch-and-go, [...] "stop-and-go", or [...] "the option", and when cleared to land, descends to 800 feet AGL. After seeing {{the threshold of the}} runway at 45 degrees behind him/her, the pilot makes another descending left or right turn to 500 feet AGL.
