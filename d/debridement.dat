5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring <b>debridement</b> (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot <b>debridement</b> therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical <b>debridement</b> of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E
40|$|A 6 -month-old child {{developed}} cutaneous mucormycosis of {{the forearm}} 5  weeks after liver transplantation, which progressed to osteomyelitis of the proximal ulna. Aggressive treatment, which included serial radical <b>debridements,</b> intravenous administration of amphotericin B, and eventually split thickness skin graft coverage resulted in successful functional salvage of the forearm, wrist, and hand. Of the nine previously {{reported cases of}} mucormycosis affecting the forearm or hand in immunocompromised patients, all either required amputation of the hand or below elbow amputation, or resulted in the patient’s death. Definitive early diagnosis and serial radical <b>debridements</b> may allow salvage of a functional hand...|$|R
30|$|Twenty-three {{of these}} {{patients}} had multiple operations before the staged arthroplasty (21 patients had <b>debridements,</b> 1 had a revision of fixation, 1 had subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy and 2 had removal of their metal work).|$|R
30|$|Continuous NPWT {{was applied}} with foam {{dressings}} at 120  mmHg.

5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or <b>debridement.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, in Week 17 {{against the}} Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when {{teammate}} Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed {{on him with}} 5:15 left in the game. Luckily for him, there was no ACL damage, according to his MRI. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but didn't play due to the injury against Minnesota. Though he participated in the team's first four training camp practices, he hadn't participated in any other practices since July 31. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic <b>debridement</b> procedure on his left knee, and has stated that {{his goal is to}} play in the 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound <b>debridement.</b> Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E
30|$|PG {{is a rare}} autoinflammatory {{syndrome}} {{of unknown}} etiology in which treatment {{is complicated by the}} pathergy phenomenon: <b>debridements</b> that scar can lead to contractures and subsequent foot deformities. Tendon releases, tendon transfers, arthrodesis and ring external fixators, like the TSF, may be used to correct these deformities.|$|R
40|$|Background. An {{increasing}} {{number of cases of}} osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) in patients treated with bisphosphonates has been reported in the literature. ONJ significantly affects the patients’ quality of life and its management is still extremely difficult. Methods. A woman with ONJ secondary to therapy with zoledronic acid came to our attention for recurrent oral infections and orocutaneous fistula unresponsive to antibiotic therapy combined with minor surgical <b>debridements.</b> The patient underwent major surgery to remove the fistula and clean the necrotic bone and soft tissues; a lobed skin platysma flap was used to close the defect. The treatment outcome was good. Conclusion. When ONJ fails to respond to antibiotic therapy and surgical <b>debridements,</b> a more invasive surgical approach may be necessary to guarantee a better quality of life for the patient...|$|R
30|$|Treatment with broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} {{coverage to}} include staphylococci, streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobes should be promptly initiated. However, aggressive surgical management remains {{the mainstay of}} treatment. This includes wide excision of all necrotic tissue down to bleeding tissues [6]. Oftentimes, repeated operative <b>debridements</b> {{may be needed to}} sufficiently debride all involved tissue.|$|R
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in <b>debridement</b> to clean wounds.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. <b>Debridement</b> of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF) is rare {{but life}} threatening soft tissue infection {{characterized by a}} necrotizing process of the subcutaneous tissues and fascial planes. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score has been verified as a useful diagnostic tool for detecting necrotizing fasciitis. A certain LRINEC score might also be associated with mortality. The aims {{of this study are}} to determine risk factors affecting the prognosis and to evaluate the prognostic value of the LRINEC score in NF. Methods: Twenty-five patients with necrotizing fasciitis treated in Samsun Education and Research Hospital between January 2008 and April 2013 were enrolled in the study. Surviving and non-surviving patient groups were compared regarding demographic data, co-morbidity, predisposing factors, causative agents, number of <b>debridements</b> and LRINEC score. Results: Mean age was 55. 6 ± 16. 79 years (min: 17 -max: 84), and the female/male ratio was 16 / 9. Mortality was observed in 6 (24 %) patients. The most frequent comorbid diseases were diabetes mellitus (52) and peripheral circulatory disorders (24 %), and the most frequent etiologies were cutaneous (32 %) and perianal abscess (20 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was higher in the non-surviving group (p= 0. 006). The mean number of <b>debridements</b> and LRINEC score were higher in the non-surviving group than in the surviving group (p= 0. 003 and p= 0. 003, respectively). Conclusions: Pseudomans aeruginosa infection and multiple <b>debridements</b> are related with mortality. The LRINEC score might help predict mortality in NF...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{describe}} {{rates of}} success for two-stage revision of prosthetic joint infection (PJI), including data on reimplantation microbiology. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data {{from all the}} cases of PJI that were managed with two-stage revision over a 4 year period.

RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two cases were identified. The overall success rate (i. e. retention of the prosthesis over 5. 75 years of follow-up) was 83 %, but was 89 % for first revisions and 73 % for re-revisions [hazard ratio = 2. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 - 7. 4, P = 0. 023].
