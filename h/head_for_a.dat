5|$|Dominic and Daniel <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{restaurant}} in the Italian North End of Boston to tell Angel's mother of her son's death. Dominic gets {{a job as a}} cook in the restaurant and changes his surname to Del Popolo (Angel's mother's surname) to hide from Carl. During this time Daniel attends Exeter, a private school in southern New Hampshire, followed by the University of New Hampshire. While at university Daniel starts writing his first novel. He also meets Katie Callahan, a radical art student, whom he agrees to marry. Katie has one mission in life: to make potential Vietnam War draftees fathers, thus enabling them to apply for paternity deferment. Daniel and Katie have a son Joe, but when Joe is 2, Katie leaves Daniel to find another young man to rescue from the war. Daniel moves to Iowa with Joe, where he enrolls in the Iowa Writers' Workshop. He also changes his name to Danny Angel to hide from Carl, and uses this nom de plume to publish his novels. After graduating from the Writers' Workshop in 1967, Danny and Joe move to Putney, Vermont.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E

With a shaved <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new image Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his moment and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|In her 2008 book, Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax, {{linguist}} Gillian Ramchand {{acknowledges the}} roles of lexical entries {{in the selection of}} complex verbs and their arguments. 'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.|$|E

25|$|Harrison {{also played}} special teams {{on a regular}} basis, making {{him one of the}} few regular NFL {{starters}} to also play special teams. His most notable special teams play for 2008, however, arguably cost the Steelers their game against the New York Giants in Week 8. With the Steelers leading 14–12 in the fourth quarter and having to punt from their own end zone, Harrison played as long snapper after regular long snapper Greg Warren suffered a season-ending knee injury earlier in the game. Harrison inadvertently snapped it over Mitch Berger's <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> safety, tying the score.|$|E
25|$|In 458 BC, he {{returned}} to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455BC. Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken his bald <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny, in his Naturalis Historiæ, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy {{that he would be}} killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.|$|E

25|$|Hokutoumi Nobuyoshi (北勝海 信芳, born June 22, 1963, as Nobuyoshi Hoshi (保志 信芳)) is {{a former}} sumo wrestler from Hokkaidō, Japan. He is the sport's 61st yokozuna and won eight top {{division}} championships. He wrestled for Kokonoe stable, as did yokozuna Chiyonofuji, and the two were the first yokozuna stablemates {{to take part in}} a play-off for the championship, in 1989. After a number of injury problems he retired in 1992, and is now the head coach of Hakkaku stable. In November 2015 he was appointed the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, following the death of Kitanoumi, initially to serve until the end of March 2016. He was then elected as <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> two-year term by his fellow board members in a vote held on March 28, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Runs {{scored in}} this manner are counted in {{addition}} to any runs already scored before the fielding error took place, and are credited to the batsman. If the ball reaches the boundary {{as a result of}} an overthrow then the four runs for the boundary is added to the number of completed runs before the overthrow, which can lead to the unusual event of a batsman scoring more than six runs off a single ball. There have been at least four instances in Test cricket of eight runs being scored off a single ball. The most recent was by Andrew Symonds for Australia against New Zealand at Brisbane in November 2008, when the batsmen managed to run four runs before the ball was thrown back over the wicket keeper's <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> four-run boundary.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{ships were}} still in sight {{on the morning of}} 13 December, but Luttrell had a large number of prisoners to guard, and with the hostile Spanish coast nearby, decided to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> British port with his prizes. He had taken 340 prisoners, and only had 190 men to guard them. Six men had been killed and four wounded on Alexander, while Ménagère had four killed and eight wounded. There were no casualties on Mediator, their opponents having been aiming at their masts and rigging in an attempt to disable the British ship. The captured prisoners made an attempt to seize the Mediator during the voyage to Britain, but prompt action by the ship's officers quashed the rising without bloodshed. Captain Gregory was shown to be the main instigator of the plot, and he and several accomplices were placed in irons {{for the remainder of the}} voyage.|$|E

25|$|To {{judge by}} the {{accounts}} of wholesale massacres in 115 BCE, the number of Jewish residents in Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia was also large. At the commencement {{of the reign of}} Caesar Augustus, there were over 7,000 Jews in Rome (though this is only the number that is said to have escorted the envoys who came to demand the deposition of Archelaus; compare: Bringmann: Klaus: Geschichte der Juden im Altertum, Stuttgart 2005, S. 202. Bringmann talks about 8,000 Jews who lived in the city of Rome.). Many sources say that the Jews constituted a full one-tenth (10%) {{of the population of the}} ancient city of Rome itself. Finally, if the sums confiscated by the governor Lucius Valerius Flaccus in the year 62/61 BCE represented the tax of a didrachma per <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single year, it would imply that the Jewish population of Asia Minor numbered 45,000 adult males, for a total of at least 180,000 persons.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins in}} Havana on December 31, 1958, roughly {{three years after}} the closing events of the {{previous}} game. Hyman Roth (Danny Jacobs) has called a meeting in Cuba to celebrate the Mafia's success in their partnership with the government of Fulgencio Batista. Attending the meeting are Michael Corleone (Carlos Ferro), his brother Fredo (John Mariano), his underboss Aldo Trapani (Rick Pasqualone), and Trapani's caporegime, Dominic (Chris Cox), as well as representatives of the Granados and Mangano families, amongst others. Roth announces that when he retires, he plans to divide up his Cuban businesses between the families. However, later that night, Batista resigns from office, as the Cuban Revolution proves victorious. Michael, Aldo, Fredo and Dominic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nearby airport, but Aldo is shot and killed. The others escape, and Michael believes with Aldo gone, the smaller families may try to muscle in on Corleone businesses in New York City. Fredo offers to take Aldo's place, but Michael ignores him, telling him to make sure Aldo's mother is taken care of financially, and instead he appoints Dominic as Aldo's replacement.|$|E
25|$|The two Indians {{continued}} to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The {{only time in}} which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, just when it seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman flashed a short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not {{get his hands on}} the ball, and it went away through third man for a four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get an edge to Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.|$|E
