25|$|The act for {{the most}} part simply reiterates <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in {{conformity}} with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to <b>existing</b> <b>provisions,</b> there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E

25|$|Originalists do not {{necessarily}} oppose protection of rights protected by substantive due process. Most originalists believe that such rights should be identified and protected legislatively or by further constitutional amendments or other <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Constitution. For example, some substantive due process liberties may be protectable according to the original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Most originalists believe that rights should be identified and protected by the majority legislatively or, if legislatures lack the power, by constitutional amendments.|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{aspects of}} the development of the law associated with the dividend payment restriction. The motivation for the article is to assess whether the existing substantive law is effective in promoting sound decision-making by corporate officers who are required to determine the timing and quantum of dividend payments. Our analysis suggests that the <b>existing</b> <b>provision</b> in s 254 T of the Corporations Act 2001 is unlikely to have a significant positive effect on dividend decisions. This is due to its failure to provide meaningful guidance to decision-makers; its divergence from contemporary accounting practice; and its imposition of unnecessary complexity to the dividend decision. The shortcomings identified suggest that reform of the <b>existing</b> <b>provision</b> is appropriate. Some reform proposals are briefly reviewed...|$|R

This would have prevented the Committee from hearing criticism of the <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> and allow the Government to introduce changes during the Committee of the Whole House without the public being able to make submissions on the new provisions.

500|$|In December 1988, the Archer Avenue Lines opened, {{utilizing}} <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> {{east of the}} Briarwood station. The E was rerouted to {{its current}} terminus at Jamaica Center. In December 2001, the connection to the IND 63rd Street Line (built along with the Archer Avenue subway), was opened and F trains were rerouted away from the 53rd Street tunnel. Around this time, the G was truncated to Court Square during peak hours and the [...] train was created to replace the F via 53rd Street. Starting in August 2007 {{after a series of}} severe summer storms, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along the Hillside Avenue section of the line, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system, due to its location {{at the bottom of the}} terminal moraine which runs across Long Island. Additional grates were later installed along Broadway and Steinway Street at the west end of the line.|$|E

500|$|Another less publicized plan {{around this}} time was a branch line {{diverging}} from the Queens Boulevard mainline near Woodhaven Boulevard, and running along the Long Island Expressway (LIE) corridor to Kissena Boulevard at Queens College, and later to Fresh Meadows and Bayside. This [...] "Northeastern Queens" [...] line, or Route 131-C, would have been built {{in conjunction with the}} planned widening of the expressway. The subway tracks would have been placed under the expressway or its service roads, or in the median of a widened LIE in a similar manner to the Congress Branch of the Chicago [...] "L". The Woodhaven Boulevard station, using <b>existing</b> <b>provisions,</b> would be converted to an express station. Three new stations would have been built during {{the first phase of the}} line, at 99th Street near LeFrak City, at Main Street, and a terminal station at Kissena Boulevard. At Main Street there would have been three tracks, and two island platforms. East of the terminus at Kissena Boulevard, there would have been two levels of layup tracks, allowing for an extension further east. A similar line along the corridor had been proposed in the 1939 IND Second System plan as an extension of the BMT Broadway Line east of the 60th Street Tunnel, when the road was called Horace Harding Boulevard prior to the construction of the expressway.|$|E

2500|$|The Malaysian {{courts have}} {{distinguished}} between {{the exercise of}} [...] "constituent power" [...] and [...] "legislative power" [...] by Parliament.

However, it is arguable that {{they are likely to}} apply the Malaysian position as the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Malaysia and the Singapore Constitution are in pari materia with each other. In addition, the High Court has rejected the basic structure or basic features doctrine developed by the Supreme Court of India, which means that Parliament is not precluded from amending or repealing any provisions of the Constitution, even those considered as basic.|$|E
50|$|William Forster's Elementary Education Act 1870 {{required}} partially state-funded board {{schools to}} be set up to provide primary (elementary) education in areas where <b>existing</b> <b>provision</b> was inadequate.

50|$|Moreover, {{interest}} on consumer loans such as {{credit card debt}} was no longer deductible. An <b>existing</b> <b>provision</b> in the tax code, called Income Averaging, which reduced taxes for those only recently making a much higher salary than before, was eliminated (although later partially reinstated, for farmers in 1997 and for fishermen in 2004).

2500|$|In 1979, Parliament {{amended the}} 1963 State Constitution to give {{authority}} to the Attorney-General of Singapore to [...] "cause to be printed and published a consolidated reprint of the Constitution of Singapore, as amended from time to time, amalgamated with such of {{the provisions of the}} Constitution of Malaysia as are applicable to Singapore, into a single, composite document". To achieve this task, the Attorney-General was given discretion to merge the <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> of the two Constitutions and make modifications that might be necessary or expedient due to Singapore's independent status; to rearrange the provisions; and to omit duplicated, inappropriate or inapplicable ones, among other things. Pursuant to this, the 1980 Reprint of the Constitution was issued. In addition, the President was empowered to authorize the Attorney-General to publish further reprints incorporating all constitutional amendments in force at the date of the authorization.|$|E
2500|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the applicant's counsel {{argued that}} the Singapore courts should {{recognize}} the basic features doctrine and thereby limit the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. The doctrine was rejected by Justice Frederick Arthur Chua. He noted that Article 5 of the Constitution does not place any limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, and concluded that if {{the framers of the}} Constitution had intended for such limitations to apply they would have expressly provided for them. Justice Chua also referred to the Malaysian case Phang Chin Hock, in which the Federal Court had rejected the basic features doctrine, stating that [...] "if our Constitution makers had intended that their successors should not in any way alter their handiwork, it would have been perfectly easy for them to so provide; but nowhere in the Constitution does it appear that that was their intention". Moreover, if proposed constitutional amendments are only valid if they are consistent with its <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> this would render Article 159 of the Malaysian Constitution, which provides for amendment of the Constitution, [...] "superfluous, for the Constitution cannot be changed or altered in any way, as if it has been carved in granite".|$|E
2500|$|As commandant, Gardner took up {{residence}} with his family outside of {{the walls of the}} fort in a large house directly opposite the Western Postern-Gate. Living in the nearby community he could not take a very active or visible role giving aid to the fort fearing reprisal to his family and himself. On one occasion, when a secession meeting was taking place nearby, accompanied with threats and demonstrations, Gardner sent word to Doubleday to assume command of the fort at once in his place. [...] Although he was a Union officer, Gardner still held various southern sympathies and felt that the South had been treated unfairly in the question of territories and had been defrauded by the interests in the North. However, he acquiesced when it came to defending the forts in Charleston Harbor. During {{the months leading up to}} the Civil War Gardner, realizing that secessionist tensions were mounting, made several requests to President James Buchanan's Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, for troops to reinforce the garrison at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island, but his requests were ignored. A southern sympathizer who was later indicted for conspiracy, Floyd had been going through great lengths to put the forts at Charleston Harbor in the hands of the South Carolinians. Instead Floyd, aware that armed conflict was imminent, only sent a company of about 70 men, most of whom were southern sympathizers, [...] "for purposes of repairing, strengthening and making additions to the fort", the activity of which only rendered the fort much less defensible. The workers he sent to Moultrie were to be fed from <b>existing</b> <b>provisions</b> at the fort, which depended on Charleston for its supplies on a weekly basis. In the event of a siege the garrison could be starved out in a matter of days, as Floyd was planning for. Gardner had become suspicious of Floyd's planning and to avert any attempts to starve out the troops he wrote to an old friend, Colonel Joseph P. Taylor, in the commissary department, requesting provisions for one hundred men for six months and hinted that he could carry out the requisition in the normal line of duty without having to inform Floyd.|$|E
