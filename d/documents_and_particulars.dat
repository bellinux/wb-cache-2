40|$|The paper {{considers}} the broader policy {{context in which}} English Post Compulsory Education and Training (PCET) is placed, examining the model of class implicit within policy <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> <b>particular</b> currents within new Labour thinking. It notes that class relations and patterns of inequality have deepened. Class as a structural feature of the social formation has been obscured {{as a result of}} individualisation and allied theorisations. Whilst class may be obscured, it remains a salient feature of contemporary society. Personalisation of the curriculum and changes to 14 - 19 education are related to class formation and the on-going generation of inequality. The closing section of the paper comments on current work that examines teaching and learning in the sector, suggesting that class needs to be placed in a pivotal position in such analyses. It concludes by arguing that a concern with social justice as well as one that seeks to interrupt processes of class formation necessitates a politicised practice that extends beyond the classroom. This requires an analysis that stresses the salience of class but also works with an expansive notion of practice that calls for a politicised understanding of PCET...|$|R

40|$|First, {{this paper}} {{describes}} a model to represent a set of heterogeneous data widely distributed. Secondly, we propose a method to use this model based on a specific learning process. This approach allows to build up dynamically a semantic database consistent with a user's group profile. To reach this goal, the database is built through using data contained in Intranets caches. With approximate criteria of search it becomes possible to retrieve document or multimedia components which best fit with the request. It is also possible to semantically compare documents or evaluate the semantic distance between a <b>document</b> <b>and</b> a <b>particular</b> theme. The model also provides a method for self-extracting themes from the semantic database. The {{first step is to}} define a semantic architecture based on neural nets.

40|$|We {{cope with}} the {{metadata}} recognition in layoutoriented documents.

The method mines the <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> determines frequent patterns, which are both literal patterns and their generalization. We also propose a sampling technique which processes a sample of <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> uses the Chernoff bounds to estimate the pattern frequency in the entire dataset. As a number of frequent patterns as feature candidates grows, the method applies a scalable feature selection method to determine the most relevant features to a given classification task. A series of evaluations on two collections show that the method performs comparably to the manual work on rule writing made by domain experts. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in scanning <b>and</b> printing <b>documents</b> in a digital library is {{the preservation of the}} quality of the <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> in <b>particular</b> of the images they contain. When photographs are offset-printed, the process of screening usually takes place. During screening, a continuous tone image is converted into a bi-level image by applying a screen to replace each colour in the original image. When high-resolution scanning of screened images is performed, it is very common in the digital version of the document to observe the screen patterns used during the original printing. In addition, when printing the digital document, moiré effects tend to appear because printing requires halftoning. In order to automatically suppress these moiré patterns, it is necessary to detect the image areas of the <b>document</b> <b>and</b> remove the screen pattern present in those areas. In this paper, we present efficient and robust techniques to segment a grayscale document into halftone image areas, detect the presence and frequency of screen patterns in halftone areas and suppress their detected screens. We present novel techniques to perform fast segmentation based on α-crossings, detection of screen frequencies using a Fast Accumulator Function and suppression of detected screens by low-pass filtering...|$|R
40|$|The whole {{structure}} of the FRBR <b>document</b> <b>and,</b> in <b>particular,</b> the concept of manifestazione seems to be somehow influenced by the remarks on the work, title and author made in the 80 ’s.

Some years ago it was highlighted that FRBR lays great emphasis on the Manifestation, as it represents a traditional doorway to old books. On the other hand, it has been often argued that the issue of access normalization within old books’ cataloguing seems much more problematic as compared to modern cataloguing. We agree with Mauro Guerrini who complained about the lack of authority files in Italy, including those of the people in charge of publishing, who are closely connected with the manifestation. In other words, to use a more modern language, the publishers, printers and booksellers.

40|$|Utilization of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs) in agriculture, forestry, {{or other}} {{environmental}} contexts has recently become common. However, {{in the case}} of spatial planning, the role of UAVs still seems to be underestimated. At present, sections of municipal development use UAVs mainly for promotional purposes (films, folders, brochures, etc.). The use of UAVs for spatial management provides results, first of all, in the form of savings in human resources and time; however, more frequently, it is also connected with financial savings (given the decreasing cost of UAVs and photogrammetric software). The performed research presented here relates to the possibilities of using UAVs to update planning <b>documents,</b> <b>and,</b> in <b>particular,</b> to update the study of conditions and directions of spatial management and preparation of local plans for physical management.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} finding topical shifts in <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> in <b>particular</b> at what information can be leveraged to identify them. Recent research on topical segmentation usually assumes that topical shifts in discourse are signalled by changes in vocabulary. This information, however, {{is not always a}} sufficient indicator of a topical shift, especially for certain genres. This paper explores an additional source of information. Our hypothesis is that the type of a referring expression is an indicator of how accessible its antecedent is. The shorter and less informative the expression (e. g., a personal pronoun versus a lengthy post-modified noun phrase), the more accessible the antecedent is likely to be and {{the more likely it is}} that the topic under discussion has remained constant between the two mentions. We explore how this information can be used to augment a lexically-based topical segmenter. We test our hypothesis on two types of data, literary narratives and lecture notes. The results suggest that our similarity metric is useful: depending on the settings it either slightly improves the performance or leaves it unchanged. They also suggest that certain types of referring expressions are more useful than others. ...|$|R
