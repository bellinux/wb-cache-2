40|$|AbstractSince the {{publication}} of Coxhead's (2000) Academic Word List, {{attempts have been made}} to investigate the importance and relevance of this general academic vocabulary list in a range of different disciplines. The current paper is a corpus-based research to explore the word frequency and text coverage of Coxhead's AWL in research articles of education. To this end, 1. 7 million-word corpus was compiled consisting of 239 research articles published by Educational Research Review, International Journal of Educational Development, International Journal of <b>Educational</b> Research, <b>Linguistics</b> and Education, Teaching and Teacher Education during the period of 2002 to 2010. Using WordSmith program, computer analysis showed that the AWL words accounted for 4. 94 % (84115 of the running words). The qualitative analysis also indicated huge differences in frequency of first two subsets in comparison to the rest (accounting for almost 50 % of the whole occurrences). An attempt was also made to identify the most frequent word families of AWL in the Education Research Articles Corpus as well as to obtain a list of non-AWL words (not included in Coxhead's list nor West's General Service List) but still have the criteria to be included in the general academic vocabulary of education. A word to be included in the list must occur at least 50 times in the corpus and appear over 5 times in all journals. This study concluded that attempts must be made to create discipline-specific word lists. Further pedagogical implications are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the AntConc corpus analysis toolkit, originally designed for use in a technical writing course at Osaka University, Japan, but now adopted in institutions throughout the world as an easy-to-use, freeware, multiplatform alternative to the many commercial concordance programs. First, I will explain how the software was originally tailored to the needs of students in the Osaka writing course and later to a general audience through the requests and feedback from teachers and students around the world. Then, I will give an overview of tools in the most recent version of AntConc and explain their value using examples from the classroom. Finally, I will discuss some of the software’s limitations and future developments, and suggest applications in professional communication.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} differences in literacy outcomes of Montessori-trained students under alternative instructional conditions in first grade. As a method of instruction, Montessori has not been adequately researched in the area of literacy to verify its efficacy in educating students. Previous studies compared Montessori students to non-Montessori students; therefore, the findings were open to the criticism that private school students enjoyed an a priori advantage over their public school counterparts. In this study, all participants had Montessori preschool experience. Roughly half the subjects chose public school and half chose to continue at Montessori for first grade. Sociofunctional <b>linguistics,</b> <b>educational</b> psychology, and Montessori 2 ̆ 7 s writing on education provided theoretical underpinnings for the study. A mixed research design was employed. Qualitative observations were conducted over a period of a calendar year. Quantitative measures were taken in a pretest/posttest format on five different literacy measures. Qualitative results show the core theme of the classroom was child-centeredness. This assertion was supported by five separate categories that emerged from observation. Quantitative results indicate that Montessori-trained students in alternative instructional conditions fared better on literacy measures than their counterparts who remained at Montessori for first grade. These results, along with methodological innovations for using literate register cohesion and genre analysis in literacy research, contribute to the educational research base in literacy studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid 1990 s, most British {{universities}} have run formalized and nationally accredited teacher education programmes for academic staff {{in their early}} years as Higher Education practitioners. Such programmes - typically Postgraduate Certificates in Academic Practice/ Higher Education - are frequently criticized for being generic in nature, focusing on general principles of learning and teaching. Furthermore, the literature surrounding adult and HE learning draws on concepts located in several academic disciplines: <b>educational</b> psychology, anthropology, <b>linguistics,</b> organizational behaviour. While many would argue that this interdisciplinarity is a strength, it can appear worryingly generalist. It {{raises the question of}} where professional learning is situated in relation to disciplinary practice and how the process of dialogue creates new communities of practice. The theoretical framework is sociocultural and draws on Bakhtin’s notion of semiotic mediation; Wenger’s work on communities of practice; and concepts of disciplinary commons (Tenenberg, Fincher et al). This paper focuses on the impact of restructuring a Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education programme so that Faculty-specific dialogue complements educational discourse. The shift of emphasis aims to create meaningful spaces to explore the nature of learning in different disciplinary areas. The process of debate created a need for participants to explore and articulate their understanding: conceptions of their subject area and their own role. This included disciplinary groups establishing their own understanding of learning processes, and exploring a model in which the more experienced academic is not necessarily the expert. This project is in its early stages, but initial feedback suggests that this approach is fruitful for new and more experienced academics (including PGCHE lecturing staff) attempting to articulate the nature of language and core concepts; and for students. Examples and case studies will illustrate {{the extent to which the}} process of engagement helps develop academic identity. ...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{is losing}} its Indigenous {{linguistic}} and cultural identity at an alarming rate. Of the 250 Indigenous languages on this continent 250 years ago, only eighteen are ‘strong’. However, if decisive action is not taken immediately we risk losing the remaining languages by 2050. Not only have these Indigenous languages been lost, but many have disappeared without adequate documentation. There is a strong desire expressed by Indigenous communities and Australian policies to reverse this situation before the remaining Indigenous languages are lost. Documentation and maintenance activities by linguistically trained Indigenous adults are vital to reducing this loss. This research project analyses the past 30 years of courses and graduates of linguistics training that has been specifically designed for Australian Indigenous adults. It then explores what enhances or constrains the work of graduates, whether due to training or other factors, {{from the point of}} view of Indigenous people at the grassroots level. The data were gathered through openended interviews with 98 participants in 22 Indigenous communities representing 32 Australian Indigenous languages across the northern half of Australia. The data show that graduates of linguistics training specifically designed for remote Indigenous adults are not working in the field or are achieving limited language documentation and maintenance outcomes. The analysis shows that changes are needed in (i) curriculum developments and delivery methods, (ii) the policy and practices of educational institutions, particularly with respect to literacy and student numbers, and (iii) access to regional language centres to help negotiate cultural and project support issues in remote communities. The details of these issues vary systematically across the diversity of social and cultural environments faced by Indigenous Australians. The results provide guidance to <b>educational</b> institutions, the <b>linguistics</b> profession and governments. They assist in the development of targeted, culturally appropriate and effective training for Indigenous language researchers and identify the vital linguistic support and policy needed in remote regions of Australia...|$|R
