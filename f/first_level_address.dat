40|$|This {{document}} {{constitutes the}} first version of the “Amodeus system reference model”. The intention of the reference model is to serve as a sound framework for reasoning about the software design of non conventional interactive systems. The model operates at three levels of refinement. Each level covers a distinct phase of the software development process and serves different purposes. The <b>first</b> <b>level</b> <b>addresses</b> issues that are of interest to both software designers and HCI modellers. It provides designers and modellers with high level concepts (e. g., fusion) and properties motivated by cognitive modelling (e. g., observability). Level 2 of the reference model provides software designers with conceptual models and formalisms (e. g., York, CNUCE and PAC-Amodeus agent-based models) that support the reification process from the task analysis or from the external specifications of a system into systemoriented constructs. Level 3 aims at providing software implementers with reusable software mechanisms that follow from Level 1 properties (e. g., the fusion mechanism) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{data from}} crisis-mapping specialists and {{emergency}} response agencies in Nairobi, Kenya, this thesis studies {{the challenges and}} potentials in diffusion and implementation of crowd innovations. The term, crowd innovations, is used to describe concepts such as crowdsourcing, crowdseeding and crowdfeeding, which builds {{on the idea that}} the public and beneficiary populations can extend their contributions to humanitarian and emergency responders through peer production and consumption of information. This idea is central to the emerging field of crisis mapping. In this thesis, a three level diffusion/implementation model is presented and applied in the analysis of how crowd innovations spread (diffusion) and are put into use (implementation). The <b>first</b> <b>level</b> <b>addresses</b> the diffusion dialogue between the crisis-mapping specialists and individual users (non-organisational adopters). The second <b>level</b> <b>addresses</b> the diffusion dialogue between the crisis-mapping specialists and the managers of relevant organisations (organisational adopters), while the third <b>level</b> <b>addresses</b> the implementation dialogue between the organisational managers and the lower-level members of the organisation (organisational adopters). A purpose of this model is to highlight the tech-specialists choice to diffuse to individuals that can serve {{as a member of a}} crowd directly, or diffuse to and through relevant organisations and their managers. The findings suggest that there are several overlapping challenges facing diffusion at different levels. These include, for example, insufficient capabilities (lack of technical skills, training, equipment etc.), mistrust in crowd-generated data and lack of knowledge about long-term consequences of adopting crowd innovations. At the same time, early involvement of well-established organisational adopters could potentially power corrective actions to overcome such challenges. In line with these and other findings, the thesis concludes that the promotion of crowd innovation should to a larger extent recognise the value of diffusion via influential response organisations and their leaders...|$|R

40|$|Within marketing, postmodern {{perspectives}} relate {{conspicuous consumption}} and status to the realisation of self-identity. The consumption {{of goods and}} their symbolic meaning allow an individual to reinforce, create and maintain his or her identity. Notions of conformity and consumption of visible goods {{could be attributed to}} social identity theory, where identity shifts from context to context. The consumption or rejection of certain goods thus reinforces an individual’s shifting identity among various contexts, such as home, school or work. It is the view of evolutionary psychology that theories such as social identity theory and consumer culture theory provide a proximal explanation of consumer behaviour, yet beyond these explanations are thought to be universal and ultimate drivers of behaviour. Evolutionary psychology presents cost signalling theory to help explain why individuals compete for status. However, existing evolutionary theories are still incomplete, particularly in explaining the paths in which individuals take to achieve status within a peer group. This research explores how and why people engage in pro-environmental behaviour. A review of the literature indicates that a desire for status is the main underlying driver motivating this type of behaviour, however the literature further indicates that theory on status is still incomplete in terms of understanding the path a person takes to achieve higher status. Therefore the gap this thesis aims to fill is to clarify the path an individual takes to achieve higher status within the context of pro-environmental behaviour. In order to identify how and why people engage in pro-environmental behaviour and strategies for status this research uses netnography to explore hierarchy negotiation within an online community of pro-environmental behaviourists called the Litterati. The Litterati is an Instagram community consisting of over 15, 000 members worldwide, whom pick up and photograph litter. The main Litterati site and associated social media pages provide the visible conditions necessary for people to compete for higher status through cost signalling. The research findings are presented as three <b>levels.</b> The <b>first</b> <b>level</b> <b>addressed</b> observed empirical events, consisting of the observed tactics used within the Litterati for gaining status. The observed tactics among the Litterati are the use of visual appeal, time, humour and reciprocity. The next <b>level</b> <b>addresses</b> events, which are not wholly observable. This consists of the themes or patterns arising from the retroductive analysis of the interviews and participant observation and how they relate to status strategies. The main themes that help explain the paths to status are self-efficacy; community; and reciprocity or validation. The third level applies evolutionary theories of status and cost signalling to explain the underlying causes of the observed behaviours. The two strategies for status, Dominance and Prestige are presented as manifestations of the dynamic relationships between each level of the findings. This research contributes to exiting theory by clarifying the path an individual takes to achieve higher status, with the analysis demonstrating that Dominance and Prestige are not as distinct as the extant literature would suggest. Additionally, this research indicates that behaviour online influences behaviour offline provided there is a strong sense of community and feelings of self-efficacy are promoted through social modelling and social persuasion. The sense of validation participants reported through the community membership led to an increase in their uptake of pro-environmental behaviours offline, including changes in their consumption decisions. The wider implications of these findings indicate online communities of ethical consumption, such as the Litterati, promote a feeling of passive activism, where discussion of social change and interaction result in behaviour change...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the work}} done in grammaticography focuses on the writing of grammars for an {{audience}} of linguists, and more specifically, typologists. In this paper, we present a grammaticographic model designed mainly {{to take into account}} the needs of minority language speakers, because they play a central role in the preservation of their language. However, since in minority language situations it is not possible to generate as many grammars as there are different potential end users, we propose a multilevel grammar, based on our experience as grammarian of Innu, a First Nation language spoken in Quebec (Canada). In this type of grammatical description, the <b>first</b> (main) <b>level</b> is <b>addressed</b> to non-specialist users, the speakers of the language being described, whereas grammatical material aimed at other users (such as linguists) is presented in secondary levels and is limited to core information.

40|$|Exploration and patrolling {{are central}} themes in {{distributed}} robotics. These deployment scenarios have deep fundamental importance in robotics, beyond {{the most obvious}} direct applications, {{as they can be}} used to model a wider range of seemingly unrelated deployment objectives. Deploying a group of robots, or any type of agent in general, to explore or patrol in dynamic or unknown environments presents us with some fundamental conceptual steps. Regardless of the problem domain or application, we are required to (a) understand the environment that the agents are being deployed in; (b) encode the task as a set of constraints and guarantees; and (c) derive an effective deployment strategy for the operation of the agents. This thesis presents a coherent treatment of these steps at the theoretical and practical <b>level.</b> <b>First,</b> we <b>address</b> the problem of obtaining a concise description of a physical environment for robotic exploration. Specifically, we aim to determine the number of robots required to be deployed to clear an environment using non-recontaminatin...|$|R

40|$|The first {{purpose of}} data {{policy should be}} to serve the {{objectives}} of the organization or project sponsoring the collection of the data. With research data, data policy should also serve the broader goals of advancing scientific and scholarly inquiry and society at large. This is especially true with government-funded data, which likely comprise the vast majority of research data. Data policy should address multiple issues, depending on the nature and objectives of the data. These issues include data access requirements, data preservation and stewardship requirements, standards and compliance mechanisms, data security issues, privacy and ethical concerns, and potentially even specific collection protocols and defined data flows. The specifics of different policies can vary dramatically, but all data policies need to address data access and preservation. Research data gain value with use and must therefore be accessible and preserved for future access. This article focuses on data access. While policy might address multiple issues, at a <b>first</b> <b>level</b> it must <b>address</b> where the data stand on what Lyon (2009) calls the continuum of openness. Making data as openly accessible as possible provides the greatest societal benefit, and a central purpose of data policy is to work toward ethically open data access.

40|$|Damage Tolerance of {{aircraft}} fuselage structures {{has a strong}} link to explosion resistance. Though accidental explosions can and do occur, intentional explosions are more common as the terrorist threat increases. Structural toughness is as welcome in these scenarios as it is under penetration of non contained engine debris. Guidelines in structural design for such conditions are obviously lacking along with knowledge of typical consequences. The EU-sponsored project VULCAN addresses blast and fire behaviour of civil fuselage structures (cabin) {{with the aim of}} achieving significant improvements. This paper deals with blast only. Characterisation and vulnerability of existing monolithic aluminium structures as well as modern laminated materials (Glare, CFRP). is undertaken in this four year program. It aims at understanding typical catastrophic failure behaviour on a dynamic materials and mechanical level and improving this through well-balanced design guidelines. A twofold approach is used, firmly building on a dedicated experimental program and validating and applying numerical simulation tools from there as well. A building block approach was conceived. <b>First</b> <b>level</b> dynamic behaviour is studied at simplified structural and materials <b>level,</b> <b>addressing</b> crack initiation and propagation.
