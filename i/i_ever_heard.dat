Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably all <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, Come On Pilgrim, featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as [...] "The Holiday Song" [...] and [...] "Vamos".|$|E

According to Rogan's longtime catcher Frank Duncan, [...] "If {{you had to}} choose between Rogan and Paige, you'd pick Rogan, because he could hit.

500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And {{that was the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{opened the}} case for the plaintiff, telling the jury that [...] "It is a simple question, aye or no, did Sir William Gordon-Cumming cheat at cards?" [...] After {{describing}} Gordon-Cumming's background and record, he explained the rules of baccarat, which he described as [...] "the most unintelligent mode of losing your own money, or getting somebody else's, <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of". Clarke also outlined Gordon-Cumming's [...] system of placing bets which, he explained, could have been mistaken by the inexperienced players as cheating, rather than a correct method of gambling. After his opening speech, Clarke then questioned Gordon-Cumming, and his approach was to show that Gordon-Cumming [...] "was a man of honour who had been sacrificed to save the courtiers".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{critic of}} the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: [...] "it is a play of itself the worst that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> in my life." [...] Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: [...] "Shakespear show'd {{the best of his}} skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him." [...] Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's [...] "most pleasing" [...] plays.|$|E

500|$|With the Nuremberg Trials {{underway}} and Japanese {{war crimes}} {{during the war}} coming to light, the announcement of Hashimoto's appearance in testimony against an American officer caused considerable controversy in the American news media. Though Hashimoto was himself known to be innocent of any war crimes and was generally treated well by his guards, he spoke little English and was subject to derision in the press. Among the public responses, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean sent an angry telegram to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal to complain, and U.S. Representative Robert L. Doughton publicly stated, [...] "It is the most contemptible thing <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of to summon a Jap officer to testify against {{one of our own}} officers. I made my living practicing law before Navy courts and boards for 25 years, and this reaches an all-time low in courts, board or congressional investigation." [...] Columnist Robert Ruark accused the Navy of using Hashimoto to [...] "hype up" [...] the court martial. Even after his departure his testimony remained controversial, and the Chicago Sun criticized his trip, which it estimated to have cost $1,820.|$|E
500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 was the first time <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

500|$|The second Milton Berle Show {{appearance}} came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Berle {{persuaded the}} singer {{to leave his}} guitar backstage, advising, [...] "Let 'em see you, son." [...] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{with a wave of}} his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy. Newspaper critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway." [...] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music [...] "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him [...] "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as [...] "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called [...] "one of the most childish expressions <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> comin' from an adult." ...|$|E
