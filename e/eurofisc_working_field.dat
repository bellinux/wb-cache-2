40|$|Direct laser {{writing is}} a {{well-known}} method for fabricating features in the micrometer scale on a large variety of materials. Several efforts for increasing the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> of a common direct-writing system {{have been made in}} the past. Basically, an improvement of the precision of used devices and the implementation of correction algorithms lead to achieve an acceptable accuracy over the complete <b>working</b> <b>field.</b> However, stitching strategies are needed to increase the working area as well as the precision. In this work, a procedure to facilitate the reduction of stitching deviations of a common direct-writing device for large areas has been developed. Using a novel vision system, deviations of the structures inside the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> are measured. Subsequently, different algorithms are used for reducing these stitching deviations. Preliminary results for a conventional laser micromachining device are presented here. Deviations were reduced between ~ 30 % and ~ 80 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} the rubber dam in {{restorative}} dentistry and endodontics - abstract MUDr. Martin Kapitán Good isolation of the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> is a condition for high quality, safe, efficient and successful work in restorative dentistry and endodontics. The use of rubber dam is considered as a standard of care in the isolation of <b>working</b> <b>field.</b> Rubber dam is a rubber membrane with holes around the crowns of isolated teeth. It separates the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> from {{the other parts of}} the oral cavity. Rubber dam protects the patients from injuries and aspiration or ingestion of small foreign bodies. It enables suction of all cooling water, preparation debris and all agents used during the treatment. It steadily provides clear access and overview of the operation field. It protects the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> from saliva contamination. It {{plays an important role in}} infection control. In spite of repetitive recommendations of dentistry authorities the use of rubber dam is not widespread, even though the most frequent arguments of dental practitioners against rubber dam have been disproved in many studies. The aims of this work were (i) to find out the frequency and circumstances of rubber dam use among dentists in the Czech Republic and to compare the data with other countries, (ii) to reveal the patients' attitudes to rubber dam [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Proper use of ophthalmoscopic {{contact lenses}} for retinal {{photocoagulation}} requires {{knowledge of their}} comparative magnification, spot size, and field of view. We determined these parameters for four commonly used lenses, using data measured from optical components of the lenses and a commonly used photo-coagulator slit-lamp and spot size changer. A Krieger lens has 8 % more <b>working</b> <b>field</b> of view and 29 % less magnification than a Goldmann lens. A Panfundoscope lens has 84 % more <b>working</b> <b>field</b> of view and 24 % less magnification than a Goldmann lens. A Mainster lens has 58 % more <b>working</b> <b>field</b> of view and 3 % more magnification than a Goldmann lens. For Goldmann, Krieger, Panfundoscope, and Mainster lenses, respectively, retinal spot size is 8 %, 53 %, 41 %, and 5 % greater than photo-coagulator spot size settings. The field of view of each lens is increased in myopic and decreased in hyperopic patients. Anterior segment irradiance is higher than retinal irradiance for 1000 microns spot size settings with a Panfundoscope or Mainster lens, and this setting should be avoided, especially in patients with hazy ocular media...|$|R

Therefore, the accuracy of the assembly cost estimation is getting important. DFA and MODAPTS is useful method for measuring the working hour. But these two methods are used just as a timetable. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest the process of measuring the working hours by MODAPTS which includes the <b>working</b> <b>field’s</b> accurate information. In addition, we adduce the estimation method of accuracy assembly cost with the real information. This research could be useful for designers that can estimate the assembly cost more accurately, and also effective for the companies that which are concerned to reduce the product cost.

40|$|Galvanometer laser {{machining}} is a well-established {{laser machining}} technique {{in which the}} laser beam is positioned on a <b>working</b> <b>field</b> by means of mirrors mounted in galvanometers. Nonetheless, new applications make necessary the development of innovative techniques for increasing the performance of such systems. Aside all the advantages of this technique like given resolution, repeatability and velocity, a limited working area is an important drawback. In this thesis work, the limitations of different state-of-the-art schemes for increasing the <b>working</b> <b>field</b> of galvanometer laser machining systems are examined. The necessity of a new strategy for reducing present deviations introducing a vision system is established. The construction of an error vector and calculation of coordinate’s transformations to improve precision are presented. In this work, the “Arithmetic mean transformation”, “individual correction transformation”, “iterative inverse distance weighting transformation” and a stitching approach denominated “Auto-stitching” are presented and demonstrated as methods for reducing inherent deviations in galvanometer scanning systems for large area processing...|$|R

The percentual differences between the individual fields of practice indicate that lecturers <b>working</b> in the <b>field</b> of humanities and languages perform more activities related to social competencies than lecturers <b>working</b> in other <b>fields</b> do.
