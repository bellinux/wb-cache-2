5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of <b>her</b> <b>babies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Becky, still crushed {{over her}} {{betrayal}} by Steve, stays with Roy and Hayley. While Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) is in prison, Becky takes part in helping Hayley {{take care of}} baby Hope (Harriet Atkins and Sadie Pilbury), whom she grows very close to and struggles to hand her back to Fiz. Becky is upset when she discovers that Tracy is pregnant with Steve's twins. Becky goes on a business meeting with Steve and attempts to seduce him, while Tracy suffers a miscarriage. Tracy assumes Steve is sleeping with Becky and goes to see her. Tracy falls {{down the stairs and}} pretends to have only just lost <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> and blames Becky. When everyone turns against her, Becky gets drunk and burns photographs of herself and Steve which causes a fire in her flat. Becky is saved from the fire by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and vows to gain revenge on Tracy. Becky begins dating Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield) who later reveals that Tracy lost the babies before her fall. Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth) helps Becky retrieve Tracy's medical records which confirm she is lying. Becky exposes Tracy's lies at her wedding reception. Becky decides to go to Barbados with Danny and Steve attempts to stop her. Becky then boards the flight with Danny and departs.|$|E

25|$|Lindy Chamberlain was {{questioned}} about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria {{was wearing a}} matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She {{was questioned}} {{about the fact that}} Azaria's singlet, which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> inside out and that she was most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence. The garments had been arranged by the investigating officer for a photograph.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{demonstrate}} that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main olfactory system following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Pregnancy and childbirth result in a high state of plasticity of the olfactory system that may facilitate olfactory learning within the mother. Neurogenesis likely facilitates the formation of olfactory memory in the mother, {{as well as the}} infant. A significant change takes place in the regulation of olfaction just after birth so that odors related with the offspring are no longer aversive, allowing the female to positively respond to <b>her</b> <b>babies.</b> Research with a variety of animals suggest the role of norepinephrine in olfactory learning, in which norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus send projections to neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. This is significant in the formation of olfactory memory and learning.|$|E
25|$|Wandering {{alone in}} the forest, the empress (she is given no name in this romance) lies tired and {{exhausted}} at a spring one evening and falls asleep. In the morning, as the dawn chorus begins, an ape suddenly emerges from the forest and steals away one of <b>her</b> <b>babies.</b> Then a lioness appears and takes away the other in its mouth. The woman is distraught! She assumes that she is being punished for her sins and undertakes to journey to the Holy Land, so she travels to the Aegean Sea and takes a ship bound for Jerusalem. On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin – we already know – had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child {{and took it to}} this island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows. They all arrive in Jerusalem where the King recognises the lady for who she is, names her little boy Octavian and allows her to stay, with her child and her lioness, in wealth and comfort.|$|E

5000|$|The episode marks series regular Diane Farr's final {{appearance}} before delivering <b>her</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>Her</b> pregnancy during season three presented writers and producers {{with the challenge}} of deciding whether to include a pregnancy into the season's storyline.

500|$|During the {{breeding}} time, the Djungarian hamster may become aggressive. After mating, the female {{may want to}} attack the male to protect <b>her</b> <b>babies.</b> The male usually hides in holes or caves to escape the vicious bite of the female. The Djungarian hamster's estrous cycle lasts four days; every four days, the female may accept the male back to breed again. This usually occurs when {{the darkness of the}} evening sets in. If [...] male and female Djungarian hamsters are not housed together from a young age, determining if the female is willing to breed with the male is difficult.|$|E

500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> – here, I'm convinced, if only for a moment, that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
500|$|Meeting with Mulder and Scully, Shannon tearfully {{tells them}} that Ausbury {{and the other}} Satanists {{repeatedly}} raped and impregnated her {{as part of their}} rituals, sacrificing <b>her</b> <b>babies.</b> When the agents confront Ausbury with the accusations, he is shocked, and denies them. Shannon stays after school to make up her assignment of dissecting the pig. Mrs. Paddock takes her bracelet and uses it as part of a spell that causes Shannon to slit her wrists. When Ausbury learns that the other faculty members plan to use Shannon as a scapegoat, he admits the sect's existence to Mulder. He confirms that rituals did happen while Shannon was present, but said that exposure to sensational media coverage led her to [...] "remember" [...] the sexual abuse. Meanwhile, Scully researches Mrs. Paddock and finds that no one knows anything about her or her background. During a sudden power outage, Mrs. Paddock steals Scully's pen and uses it to impersonate her in a call to Mulder, pretending to be in trouble. Mulder handcuffs Ausbury in the basement to prevent his possible escape, then leaves to help Scully. Soon after, a giant snake appears, controlled by Mrs. Paddock, and devours Ausbury.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Want You" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, who previously directed Jackson's music videos for [...] "All for You" [...] and [...] "Just a Little While". It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out of my apartment building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. He has a great eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work.

500|$|One of Val's {{most memorable}} storylines occurs during the 1984-85 season {{when she is}} told that her infant twins are stillborn. Val senses that this could not be true as she clearly remembers hearing the babies cry. She suffers a nervous {{breakdown}} and disappears from Knots Landing for several months, and is later reunited with <b>her</b> <b>babies,</b> thanks largely to the investigations secretly undertaken by her neighbors Mack and Karen MacKenzie. In 1991, over 8 years after their second divorce, Gary and Val got married {{for the third time}} (Valene's fifth marriage, and Gary's fourth). While working on an assignment to write a biography about Greg Sumner (William Devane) in 1992, Valene crosses paths with some mafioso type characters who are targeting Sumner. Fearing that she could expose them, they kidnap Val and she is later believed to have died in a car accident. Joan Van Ark had decided to leave the series in 1992, at the end of Season 13, {{which turned out to be}} the show's penultimate season. However, Van Ark came back in the 2-part finale to the show's final season in 1993, when it was discovered that Val was never in the car. Having escaped her kidnappers, she later returns to the cul-de-sac. Valene is seen once again in the 1997 reunion mini-series [...] where she begins a new career as a screenwriter and adapts her best-selling novel [...] "Hostage", which tells the story of her kidnapping five years earlier, into a film.|$|E
2500|$|The sympathies of {{the local}} people were also in question, with {{observers}} unsure of how many residents of Shaba supported the rebels. The image of the FAZ–Moroccan forces deteriorated when three Moroccan troops stabbed a Kolwezi woman to death and beat <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> after she denied them sex. (It was later determined that the soldiers raped the woman and killed <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> on bayonetes; they were executed after military tribunal held in Shaba.) [...] Local people were threatened, imprisoned, and killed by the Zairian military {{in an effort to}} discourage them from joining the rebels. The European (and Australian and Canadian) missionaries who surfaced after fleeing to Angola said that locals supported the rebels, none of whom were Cuban or Angolan, because they opposed Mobutu.|$|E
2500|$|Sue {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "highly strung" [...] with a parlous emotional state. Author Hilary Kingsley has suggested that Sue was a character who was [...] "dogged by tragedy". She suggested that Sue was a [...] "moaner" [...] but despite this she [...] "did enjoy life a lot", making reference to her love for her husband Ali (despite his flaws) and <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> as evidence of this. Kingsley's surmation of Sue stems around psychological problems however, with her suggesting that Sue was [...] "always mentally unstable" [...] and that she was never [...] "that strong at the best of times". In her book Soapbox, Kingsley suggested that Sue, like many women in EastEnders, was [...] "very much the power behind the throne. She virtually runs the cafe singlehanded. She fights with their [...] landlord, tells the customers (the other residents) the unvarnished truth about themselves and struggles to keep Ali from gambling away the profits." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dionysius of Halicarnassus {{claims that}} the {{earliest}} Vestals at Alba Longa were whipped and [...] "put to death" [...] for breaking their vows of celibacy, and that their offspring were to be thrown into the river. According to Livy, Rhea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus, {{had been forced to}} become a Vestal Virgin, and when she gave birth to the twins, it is stated that she was merely loaded down with chains and cast into prison, <b>her</b> <b>babies</b> put into the river. Dionysius also relates the belief that live burial was instituted by the Roman king Tarquinius Priscus, and inflicted this punishment on the priestess Pinaria. The 11th century Byzantine historian George Kedrenos is the only extant source for the claim that prior to Priscus, the Roman King Numa Pompilius had instituted death by stoning for unchaste Vestal Virgins, and that it was Priscus who changed the punishment into that of live burial. But whipping with rods sometimes preceded the immuration as was done to Urbinia in 471 BC.|$|E
