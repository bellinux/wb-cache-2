25|$|Many {{operating}} systems support {{one or more}} vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example, SNA on IBM systems, <b>DECnet</b> on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, and Microsoft-specific protocols (SMB) on Windows. Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as NFS for file access. Protocols like ESound, or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications, on a remote system's sound hardware.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when AT agreed {{to place the}} TCP/IP code {{developed}} for UNIX into the public domain. Various vendors, including IBM, included this code in their own TCP/IP stacks. Many companies sold TCP/IP stacks for Windows until Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95. This event was a little late {{in the evolution of}} the Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols, which began to lose ground. These protocols included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's <b>DECnet,</b> Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).|$|E
25|$|IBM, AT and DEC {{were the}} first major {{corporations}} to adopt TCP/IP, despite having competing internal protocols (SNA, XNS, <b>DECNET).</b> In IBM, from 1984, Barry Appelman's group did TCP/IP development. (Appelman later moved to AOL {{to be the head}} of all its development efforts.) They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. At the same time, several smaller companies began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and MS Windows, such as the company FTP Software, and the Wollongong Group. The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1987 DKUUG {{made a name}} {{agreement}} ("navneaftalen") {{with the}} coordinators of the three other networks then working in Denmark, a national experimental X.400 net (EAN from University of British Columbia), EARN and <b>DECnet,</b> concerning the [...]dk domain. They agreed to share it, hiding from the users which network they were connected to, and nullifying the use of pseudo-domains like [...]uucp or second-level domains like gov.uk, thereby creating a practice that has been enforced ever since, and also applied in other countries.|$|E
50|$|Enhancements made to <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV {{eventually}} {{became known as}} <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV+, although systems running this protocol remained completely interoperable with <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV systems.|$|E
5000|$|... the <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV Control Protocol (DNCP) for DNA Phase IV Routing {{protocol}} (<b>DECnet</b> Phase IV), protocol {{code number}} 0x8027, RFC 1762 ...|$|E
50|$|The initial {{implementations}} released {{were for}} VMS and RSX-11, later this expanded to virtually every operating system DIGITAL ever shipped with {{the notable exception}} of RT-11. <b>DECnet</b> stacks are found on Linux, SunOS and other platforms, and Cisco and other network vendors offer products that can cooperate with and operate within <b>DECnet</b> networks. Full <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV specifications are available.|$|E
50|$|The Ethernet {{implementation}} {{was unusual}} {{in that the}} software changed the physical address of the Ethernet interface on the network to AA-00-04-00-xx-yy where xx-yy reflected the <b>DECnet</b> network address of the host. This allowed ARP-less LAN operation because the LAN address could be deduced from the <b>DECnet</b> address. This precluded connecting two NICs from the same <b>DECnet</b> node onto the same LAN segment, however.|$|E
50|$|VAX and MicroVAX {{computers}} (very {{widespread in}} the 1980s) running VMS formed {{one of the most}} important proprietary networks, <b>DECnet,</b> which linked business and research facilities. The <b>DECnet</b> protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with <b>DECnet</b> phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.|$|E
50|$|The <b>DECnet</b> {{protocols}} {{were designed}} entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, <b>DECnet</b> Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including ones for FreeBSD and Linux.|$|E
50|$|<b>DECnet</b> {{was built}} {{right into the}} DEC {{flagship}} operating system VMS since its inception. Later Digital ported it to Ultrix, as well as Apple Macintosh and IBM PC running variants of DOS and Microsoft Windows under the name DEC Pathworks, allowing these systems to connect to <b>DECnet</b> networks of VAX machines as terminal nodes. An open-source version was developed for Linux. <b>DECnet</b> code in the Linux kernel was marked as orphaned on February 18, 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Integrated {{computer}} networking (originally <b>DECnet,</b> {{and later}} TCP/IP) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>DECnet</b> is a {{suite of}} network {{protocols}} created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved {{into one of the}} first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The <b>DECnet</b> protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, <b>DECnet</b> Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.|$|E
5000|$|<b>DECnet</b> end-node {{connectivity}} {{with the}} host and client systems ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time that <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV was {{released}}, the company also released a proprietary protocol called LAT for serial terminal access via Terminal servers. LAT shared the OSI physical and datalink layers with <b>DECnet</b> and LAT terminal servers used MOP for the server image download and related bootstrap processing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>DECnet</b> - Digital's {{proprietary}} networking architecture {{which also}} includes MOP.|$|E
50|$|It {{normally}} used the <b>DECnet</b> networking system {{as opposed to}} TCP/IP.|$|E
5000|$|LAT and VMS {{drove the}} initial surge of {{adoption}} of [...] "thick-wire" [...] Ethernet {{by the computer}} industry. By 1986, terminal server networks accounted for 10% of Digital's $10 billion revenue. These early Ethernet LANs scaled using Ethernet bridges (another DEC invention) as well as <b>DECnet</b> routers. Subsequently, Cisco routers, which implemented TCP-IP and <b>DECnet,</b> emerged as a global connection between these packet-based Ethernet LANs.|$|E
50|$|The WANK Worm was a {{computer}} worm that attacked DEC VMS computers in 1989 over the <b>DECnet.</b> It {{was written in}} DIGITAL Command Language.|$|E
50|$|At around 17:00 EST on December 22, 1988, a worm was {{detected}} on the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN). This was a NASA network on the <b>DECnet</b> Internet with many connections to other networks such as HEPnet. The {{majority of the}} computers on SPAN were VAX computers operating VAX/VMS software. The worm originated from a computer on the <b>DECnet</b> in Switzerland by a person using the multi-user login name PHSOLIDE. The infection was thought to have spread to more than 6,000 computer nodes.|$|E
50|$|Leased {{lines were}} used to connect {{mainframe}} computers with terminals and remote sites, via IBM Systems Network Architecture (created in 1974) or <b>DECnet</b> (created in 1975).|$|E
5000|$|Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP) is a byte-oriented {{communications}} protocol devised by Digital Equipment Corporation in 1974 to allow communication over point-to-point network links for the company's <b>DECnet</b> Phase I network protocol suite. The protocol uses full or half duplex synchronous and asynchronous links and allowed errors introduced in transmission to be detected and corrected. It was retained and extended for later {{versions of the}} <b>DECnet</b> protocol suite. DDCMP {{has been described as}} the [...] "most popular and pervasive of the commercial byte-count data link protocols".|$|E
50|$|LanMan {{normally}} {{ran across}} Microsoft's basic, non-routable NetBIOS/NetBEUI NBF protocol, but Pathworks included a <b>DECnet</b> stack, including layers like the LAT transport used for terminal sessions. The complexity of <b>DECnet</b> by 1980s PC standards {{meant that the}} Pathworks client was a huge software stack to have resident in MS-DOS; configuring the Pathworks client was a complex task, made more so {{by the need to}} preserve enough Conventional memory for DOS applications to run. To keep a reasonable amount of base memory free mandated the use of QEMM or a similar memory manager.|$|E
5000|$|<b>DECnet</b> {{refers to}} a {{specific}} set of hardware and software networking products which implement the DIGITAL Network Architecture (DNA). The DIGITAL Network Architecture has a set of documents which define the network architecture in general, state the specifications for each layer of the architecture, and describe the protocols which operate within each layer. Although network protocol analyzer tools tend to categorize all protocols from DIGITAL as [...] "DECnet", strictly speaking, non-routed DIGITAL protocols such as LAT, SCS, AMDS, LAST/LAD are not <b>DECnet</b> protocols and {{are not part of the}} DIGITAL Network Architecture.|$|E
50|$|Interlink {{was founded}} in 1983 by Lambert Onuma, Fred Wright, Karl Johnson and Greg Thompson, {{formerly}} of Digital Equipment Corporation. The company's first product, called simply Interlink, allowed IBM MVS mainframes {{to be connected to}} VAX computers on a <b>DECnet</b> network. Later a VM/DECnet product was developed in cooperation with Dupont to link IBM VM/CMS systems with a <b>DECnet</b> network interconnecting e-mail, file, tape, and storage access, terminal emulation, a program-to-program API, and enabling <b>DECnet</b> to be tunneled over an SNA LU6.2 network. In 1990, Interlink acquired a product called ACCES/MVS from Advanced Computer Communications, which implemented a native TCP/IP protocol stack on the MVS and VM operating systems and within CICS regions. First released in 1986, ACCES/MVS had been the first commercial TCP/IP implementation for MVS mainframes. Interlink developed and marketed this product as SNS/TCPaccess. The prefix was later dropped, and TCPaccess became the company's main focus of development by the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|It offered {{very tight}} {{integration}} with the ND-NOTIS applications, {{as well as}} the SINTRAN III operating systems. In many ways, it was a strong parallel to DEC's <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV system.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{document}} didn't limit support to TCP/IP, TCP and UDP {{were the only}} protocols explicitly mentioned. Most vendors only delivered TCP/IP support, although Winsock from DEC included <b>DECNet</b> support as well.|$|E
50|$|The DECserver device's {{hardware}} address must be {{specified in the}} <b>DECnet</b> node database {{in order for the}} firmware file to be loaded. The firmware's filename is not specified in the <b>DECnet</b> database, it is found in a network request from the terminal server. If the firmware file does not exist in the MOM$SYSTEM directory at the time of a load request, the terminal server will not complete its boot process, and an error message will be displayed on the OpenVMS operator's console (and written to SYS$MANAGER:OPERATOR.LOG) and this message will give the name of the missing file.|$|E
50|$|The X Protocol {{provided}} {{a way to}} show high resolution images of data and graphics over a network connection. NCD supported a range of network protocols including TCP/IP, token ring, <b>DECnet</b> and others.|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} of session layer implementations include Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) - the AppleTalk protocol that coordinates the name binding process, and Session Control Protocol (SCP) - the <b>DECnet</b> Phase IV session-layer protocol.|$|E
50|$|On an Alpha, Itanium or VAX system {{running the}} OpenVMS {{operating}} system, these files {{are located in}} a directory named SYS$SYSROOT:MOM$SYSTEM which has system logical names of MOM$SYSTEM and MOM$LOAD if <b>DECnet</b> has been started.|$|E
50|$|The initial plan (1987) was to {{make use}} of a number of {{existing}} Bitnet and CCnet (regional <b>DECnet</b> network) connections to get started. Three network (compatible) protocols were used, NJE, <b>DECnet,</b> and TCP/IP. The first OARnet-funded line was installed between Case Western Reserve University and John Carroll University in June 1987. Many subsequent lines at 9.6 kbit/s, 56 kbit/s, and T1 (1.544 Mbit/s) were installed with the aid of an Ohio Department of Administrative Services contract with Litel Corp. Internet (then NSFnet) connections were obtained in the spring of 1988. The non-TCP/IP protocols were soon phased out, and a process of upgrading connections took place regularly.|$|E
50|$|The {{first chapter}} of Underground relates the {{diffusion}} and reactions of the computer security community to the WANK worm that attacked DEC VMS computers over the <b>DECnet</b> in 1989 and was purportedly coded by a Melbourne hacker.|$|E
50|$|Several {{very large}} <b>DECnet</b> {{networks}} with Mail-11 service existed, most notably ENET, which was DEC's worldwide internal network. Another big user was HEPNET, a network {{for the high}} energy physics research community that linked many universities and research labs.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC {{was well}} {{respected}} for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly <b>DECnet</b> products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its [...] "dumb terminal" [...] subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.|$|E
5000|$|The worm {{propagated}} {{through the}} network pseudo-randomly from one {{system to the}} other by using an algorithm which converted the victim machine's system time into a candidate target node address (composed of a <b>DECnet</b> Area and Node number) and subsequently attempted to exploit weakly secured accounts such as SYSTEM and <b>DECNET</b> that had password identical to the usernames. The worm did not attack computers within <b>DECnet</b> area 48, which was New Zealand. A comment inside the worm source code {{at the point of}} this branch logic indicated that New Zealand was a nuclear free zone. New Zealand had recently forbidden U.S. nuclear-powered vessels from docking at its harbours, thus further fueling the speculation inside NASA that the worm attack was related to the anti-nuclear protest. The line [...] "You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war" [...] is drawn from the lyrics of the Midnight Oil song [...] "Blossom and Blood". Midnight Oil are an Australian rock band known for their political activism and opposition to both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The process name of the second version of the worm to be detected was [...] "oilz", an Australian shorthand term for the band.|$|E
