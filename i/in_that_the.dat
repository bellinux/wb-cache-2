5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with {{a return to the}} gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E

5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and {{joined by a}} small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E

5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} glow {{discharge}} plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz.

5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the systems are to replicate, {{regardless of whether they}} benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus started {{developing}} its crest when {{half the size}} of adults, but Parasaurolophus juveniles grew crests when only 25% as long as adults. Juvenile Corythosaurus, along with adults, had a premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Young and adult Corythosaurus are similar to Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to Parasaurolophus <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sutures of the skull are sinuous, and not smooth and straight. This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia are quite alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|Cranham forms {{part of the}} Hornchurch and Upminster UK Parliament constituency, and {{is partly}} within the Havering wards of Upminster and Cranham. Together these form the Upminster Area Committee. The current MP is Angela Watkinson. Each ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All six councillors elected in 2010 for the two wards were the Upminster and Cranham Residents' Association {{candidates}} and the area is unusual <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> residents' association is strongly active. From 1945 to 1974 Cranham formed part of the Hornchurch constituency and from 1974 to 2010 it formed part of the Upminster constituency. Cranham is within the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency and the London European Parliament constituency.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled {{water of the}} tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night.

This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
