5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
25|$|In a Charlie Rose {{interview}} in 2000, Cartier-Bresson {{noted that it}} wasn't necessarily that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be photographed, but {{it was that he}} was embarrassed by the notion of being photographed for being famous.|$|E
500|$|However, {{preceding}} 1951 season, he reimposed {{the blackout}} rule on all {{teams in the}} league. The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, [...] "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect {{them to go to}} the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Bell was ecstatic. Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games. Although <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> fly, at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.|$|E

2500|$|Nadeau {{was born}} on September 9, 1970, {{and grew up in}} Danbury, Connecticut. His parents were Gerald Joseph, a roofer, and veteran in the United States Army (1944â€“2007) and Pauline Cyr Nadeau. Nadeau's {{ancestors}} originate from St. John's Valley, Maine. He has one sister, Debbie. Nadeau was educated at Henry Abbott Technical High School and studied automotive technology. His family had connections to auto racing; Gerald raced modifieds at the Danbury Race Arena. Nadeau was given a go-kart by his father when he was four and one-half years old. He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up. He wasn't afraid to yell and get on my toes to do my job because <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose and I hated to lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie {{patted her}} hand kindly. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> spoil her girlish day-dreams.|$|E
60|$|Archie looked grave. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> give pain, {{but he felt}} he must be honest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know he is, and I try to {{keep him}} decent, but I forget, and <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> be fixed, and Miss Bat doesn't care, and father laughs when I talk about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] she said. [...] "I {{hope you}} will be careful to keep them out. He always has such a lot of secrets, and I know that <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> have people prying round." ...|$|R
6000|$|He loves <b>to</b> be little, <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> be big, [...] 'Tis he that inhabits {{the caves}} that you dig; [...] 'Tis he {{when you play}} with your {{soldiers}} of tin [...] That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.|$|R
60|$|The pause was expressive. Inspector Jacks' eyes brightened. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> {{feel that}} his {{day had been}} {{altogether}} wasted.|$|E
60|$|The sailor addressed, scowled. It was not {{his watch}} on deck and <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> have his midday nap disturbed.|$|E
60|$|It was the man's shyness {{that made}} all the trouble. It seemed as if <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be taken notice of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> be idle; {{though what}} he earns doesn't add much to our exchequer. However, {{he says that}} when people are living upon their capital they must keep down current {{expenses}} by turning a penny where they can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{used to run}} up that hilly {{road for}} a breather, and think nothing of it. It {{would be a long}} job for him now, poor little chap, for his leg often {{troubles}} him, though <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> own it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He loves <b>to</b> be little, <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> be big, [...] 'T is he that inhabits {{the caves}} that you dig; [...] 'T is he {{when you play}} with your {{soldiers}} of tin [...] That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think he}} has more initiative?" [...] Guy asked, with a {{somewhat}} nettled air. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be thought less individual than Cyril.|$|E
60|$|The dealer frowned. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> {{think of}} a {{customer}} going to somebody else. In fact, this was, for a debtor, an unpardonable offense.|$|E
60|$|At first, {{he thought}} he would arouse some of the others, but all {{appeared}} to be sleeping so soundly <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{on account}} of you, Jimmy," [...] she answered, [...] "nor of any one else here, in fact. The truth is he has {{conceived}} a violent admiration for me--an admiration so pronounced, indeed, that <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> let me out of his sight." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{waved him}} back. Something {{of the old}} look, which <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> so <b>to</b> see, was in her face.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} spoofed on Sesame Street as [...] "Just Throw It My Way", Oscar the Grouch's anti-litter anthem.

Instead he urges Muppet boys and girls to throw it his way, right into his trash can.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad--Jorth is comin'," [...] said Jean, huskily. How <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> {{be forced}} to tell his father that! The boyish love of old had flashed up.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> see her, I knew. But I {{imagined}} in his voice--for I noted it even then--there rang some undertone {{of genuine}} desire to save her.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> rule so clever-seeming a woman quite out of court. But {{he remembered}} her {{scissors}} glance at him, and his soft little heart became very hard.|$|E
60|$|Thackeray has a {{dread of}} servants, insomuch that <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> address them, or {{to ask them}} for anything. His morbid sensibility, in this regard, has perhaps led him to study and muse upon them, so {{that he may be}} presumed to have a more {{intimate}} knowledge of this class than any other man.|$|R

60|$|It {{struck her}} that an illness {{she did not}} know might explain what had so much puzzled her. He flushed, for <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> refer to his deformity.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, you see, <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> travel, and I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> keep still, so we each suit ourselves, {{and there}} is no trouble. I am often with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?"
