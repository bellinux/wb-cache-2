2500|$|Livezeanu's {{thesis on}} the birth of Romanian fascism was criticized by Constantin Iordachi, who argued that {{the link between the}} local middle class and far right {{movement}} was only obvious in the cases of fascist intellectuals such as Nae Ionescu and Crainic, whereas the Iron Guard is known to have engaged in an open conflict and, eventually, a bloody battle with moderate nationalist groupings. He nonetheless praised Cultural Politics in Greater Romania for its innovative approach, while noting that: [...] "the examination of the civil society concept in the interwar context presents a special interest for contemporary Romanian society, given that it evidences the measure in which the obsession over historical justice, the excessive centralization, xenophobia and ethnocentrism undermine the development of <b>democratic</b> <b>pluralism,</b> alienate any potential sentiment of loyalty the national minorities might have toward the Romanian state, bereaving Romanian society of important creative forces." [...] Historian Ovidiu Pecican also cited Livezeanu's study, alongside those of Jean Ancel, as evidence that the image of interwar Romania as [...] "solely nimbed by the progresses following stately unification" [...] needed to be amended.|$|E

40|$|This paper verifies {{the aspects}} {{related to the}} {{development}} of Law in modern times, showing how the current paradigmatic model of the legal system evolved. It indicates incongruencies and difficulties in the implementation of this model, as well as the rhetorical use made by the dominating elites for the defense of exclusive and particular interests. This work shows the characteristics of the theory of autopoyetic systems, and its use in social sciences, presenting the characteristics of the autopoyetic model for the law system. It delineates the allopoyetic configuration of Law, mainly of the legal model of peripheral countries, including Brazil. This research confirms that the theory of system, although useful for several characterizations of |Law, is not in accord with the empirical reality. This work also expresses how the legal culture may be remodeled in peripheral countries, basing it on a new ideology: the participative <b>democratic</b> legal <b>pluralism,</b> in which new social subjects may be considered legitimate sources producers of Law, not matching the capitalist bourgeois model of modern Law. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{battles between}} proponents {{and opponents of}} {{judicial}} supremacy have recently intensified in the US and also in Europe. I summarise the debates in political philosophy, legal theory and comparative constitutionalism and argue that both judicial supremacy and parliamentary supremacy claims are empirically and normatively indefensible: no one actually has or should have the last word. Instead, we need adversarial judicial, political and public dialogues stimulated by cooperation/competition between parliaments and courts and other actors. I focus on judicial review in two contexts. I ask whether the Canadian notwithstanding clause might provide a rational way forward, if properly amended. For the EU I analyse new forms of dialogue, cooperation and competition between parliaments and constitutional courts in Member States, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. Learning from these comparisons, I submit, can profit from two non-legal discussions: first on ‘democratising expertise’ in the traditions of critical pragmatism and experimentalist governance and, second, on the traditions of <b>democratic</b> institutional <b>pluralism</b> and associative democracy...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to {{mainstream}} liberal accounts placing Eastern European countries under {{the common denominator}} of being exclusively ethnically divisive societies plagued by historically entrenched primordial divisions, the eruption of violent ethno-religious conflict in the former Yugoslavia was an {{exception rather than the}} rule in the region. This paper will argue that ethnic nationalism although present in some form, is not an eternally prevailing, historically and geographically fixed feature of all Eastern European countries, and the processes of remedying ethnic animosities during transition vary from country to country determined by diverse factors such as history, culture, national identity and domestic politics. This variation in unique ethnic conflict management will be illustrated with the case of Bulgaria, which witnessed during its initial transition period (1989 - 1991) the escalation of animosities between the country’s largest Muslim minority population and the national Bulgarian majority. Nevertheless, ethnic differences were channeled for mediation in the political and social space, without resorting to violent means. Ethnic politics do not always represent a ‘ticking time bomb waiting to explode’ if they involve cooperation and compromise. <b>Democratic</b> ethno- <b>pluralism</b> was constructive in the Bulgarian case to fostering civic unity, while guaranteeing safeguards for ethnic identity and self- expression in various spheres (education, party politics and the media). During the country’s unstable transition period, democratic ethno-pluralism fostered the conditions for managing the initial escalation of ethnic tensions...|$|R

40|$|Political theorists in {{the last}} few decades have {{developed}} three distinct kinds of pluralism, as they attempt to imagine a political life appropriate for an increasingly complex world characterised by the excessively unifying forces of globalisation and the potentially divisive forces of mass migration and multiculturalisation. 'Value pluralism' theorises the inherently conflicting nature of human value, providing us with a way of approaching moral, cultural, and political conflict; 'democratic pluralism' considers the nature of intermediate groups in civil society and their role to viable democratic politics; and 'agonistic pluralism' commends an ideal of democratic life where citizens actively and expressively engage in political activities to acquire a sense of identity and solidarity. Contemporary debates over value, <b>democratic</b> and agonistic <b>pluralisms</b> have taken place largely in isolation with each other; this thesis challenges the convention and offers a first comprehensive analysis of the contemporary pluralist ideas and their simultaneous emergence in the mid-twentieth century. The first part of the thesis discusses the pioneering formulations of value, <b>democratic</b> and agonistic <b>pluralisms</b> in the works of Isaiah Berlin, Robert Dahl, and Hannah Arendt, and analyses how those works have shaped the post-,; [...] 1980 s debates. The second part considers why multiple kinds of pluralism emerged {{as they did in the}} 1950 s and 1960 s. It argues that Berlin, Dahl and Arendt all appealed to the idea of 'the plural' as they attempted to propose antidotes to multi dimensionally monist totalitarianism, and that they formulated different pluralist antidotes because they theorised the nature and role of political theory differently and accordingly focused on different aspects oftotalitarianism. The lesson to be learnt from the mid-twentieth century is that real-world changes pose complex monist challenges to multiple aspects of life, so that those who care about pluralism must overcome today's fragmentation of pluralist discourses and become acquainted with diverse vocabularies to mobilise multiple pluralist ideas.

40|$|Public {{values are}} {{moving from a}} {{research}} concern to policy discourse and management practice. There are, though, different readings of what public values actually mean. Reflection suggests two distinct strands of thinking: a generative strand that sees public value emerging from processes of public debate; and an institutional interpretation that views public values as the attributes of government producers. Neither perspective seems to offer a persuasive account of how the public gains from strengthened public values. Key propositions on values are generated from comparison of influential texts. A provisional framework is presented of the values base of public institutions and the loosely coupled public propositions flowing from these values. Value propositions issue from different governing contexts, which are grouped into policy frames that then compete with other problem frames for citizens’ cognitive resources.

40|$|The recent (re-) {{establishment}} of constitutional democracies in Central and Eastern Europe {{is affected by}} a paradoxical situation: while modern constitutionalism was significantly strenghtened by the ‘new constitutionalism’ in the region, it is itself increasingly seen as {{out of touch with}} (pluralist) reality. In the paper, I explore to what extent it can be claimed that the new constitutionalism adopted in the former communist countries is a reinvigorated version of ‘traditional’ modern constitutionalism. To the extent that this seems indeed to be the case, I outline a number of problématiques or tensions that modern constitutionalism provokes in the current European context. These include four problématiques in particular: state-centrism, cultural diversity, depoliticization, and participation. In the third section, I will discuss possible solutions to or ways out of these four problématiques by hinting at, in a descriptive sense, insufficiently (or un-) explored dimensions of the Central and Eastern European constitutions. And in a more normative sense, I will at the same time indicate possible steps towards constitutional change that would, in my view, make current constitutional orders more amenable to challenges of <b>pluralism,</b> <b>democratic</b> legitimacy, and post-nationalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the meaning of {{multiculturalism}} in a college of teacher education. The research questions were: (1) What is the meaning of multiculturalism in teacher education? (2) How can a college change from Eurocentric to multi-cultural? (3) What is required of faculty and administrators to become multicultural educators who in turn facilitate the training of effective multicultural educators for a pluralistic society?^ Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 faculty and administrators in the teachers college of a large midwestern university. The college was found to be implementing aspects of multicultural education without an understanding of the meaning of multiculturalism. The literature search indicated that to effectively become multicultural the college needed a strong philosophical base defining multicultural education. A broad definition of culture including issues of racism, classism, sexism, abelism, and global issues was recommended. ^ The faculty and administrators revealed a wealth of knowledge and wisdom about human understanding and the importance of multicultural ideals. Conflicting ideas about multiculturalism and confusion about NCATE mandates were also apparent. Consequently, the metaphor of a drama of reconceptualization emerged as a 20 th century morality play in which the administrators and faculty [...] the players [...] were seen to be performing the roles of Knowledge, Commitment, Conscience, Equality, Affirmation, Wisdom, and Ignorance during a process of educational change. ^ Two theoretical ideals promoting dialogues within the college were proposed to facilitate the drama: the process of <b>democratic</b> cultural <b>pluralism</b> (Lynch, 1986) promoting critical thinking, and Friedmann 2 ̆ 7 s (1973) 2 ̆ 2 transactive planning. 2 ̆ 2 Acknowledged experts would be invited to bring the processed knowledge concerning theories, concepts, and models.
