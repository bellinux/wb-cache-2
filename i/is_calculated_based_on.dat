5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing gears and engines are visible. A confidence index <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> {{the number of items}} collected by lasers. If good data confidence is achieved, the position is updated. This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|When combat is initiated, a {{separate}} screen shows the battle play out: attack power {{is based on}} the strength of weapons and their units, while damage <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> both the type of attack used and the opposing unit's physical and magical defense. Critical hits triple the damage of normal attacks. Each battle awards experience points, which raise a unit's experience level: their level and statistics cap at 20. When a character changes class, their experience level returns to 1 while their stats increase slightly. Unit abilities can be influenced through a Support system: when two characters have a story-based relationship such as being lovers of friends, they boost stats such as attack power or dodging ability.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of}} the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

25|$|The {{test can}} be scored two ways. The number correct score <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an all-or-nothing approach; points are awarded if the {{reproduction}} of the design matches the original. The number error score, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the number and type of errors made for each design. The major categories for these errors are omissions, distortions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, and size errors. These scores are then be compared to several sets of normative data available in the manual, each representing different demographic characteristics, and conclusions can be drawn by the examiner. The two different methods of scoring allow for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of an individual's test.|$|E

The HPI-1 <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight.

Therefore, periodic decompression of the stomach though nasogastric intubation is essential to prevent rupture. Horses are monitored closely following abdominal surgery, and a sudden increase in heart rate indicates the need to check for nasogastric reflux, as it is an early indication of postoperative ileus. The horse is placed on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance and prevent hypovolemic shock, and rate of fluids <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> daily maintenance requirement plus fluid lose via nasogastric reflux.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of self {{consumption}} payback time <b>is</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> how much electricity is not brought from the grid. Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. An additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057 to $8,213 (analysis from 2009).|$|E

25|$|Privacy {{amplification}} is {{a method}} for reducing (and effectively eliminating) Eve's partial information about Alice and Bob's key. This partial information could have been gained both by eavesdropping on the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, {{in such a way}} that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a universal hash function, chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened <b>is</b> <b>calculated,</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> how much information Eve could have gained about the old key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value.|$|E
