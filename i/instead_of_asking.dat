25|$|Another {{approach}} to choosing an SOB: The auctioneer may achieve good success {{by asking the}} expected final sales price for the item, as this method suggests to the potential buyers the item's particular value. For instance, say an auctioneer is about to sell a $1,000 car at a sale. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> $100, hoping to entice wide interest (for who wouldn't want a $1,000 car for $100?), the auctioneer may suggest an opening bid of $1,000; although the first bidder may begin bidding at a mere $100, the final bid may more likely approach $1,000.|$|E

In 211, Cao Cao engaged {{a coalition of}} northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui at the Battle of Tong Pass. After discovering that Han Sui did not leave any troops to guard Puban Ford (浦阪津), Xu Huang suggested to Cao Cao to send him north and cross the Yellow River via Puban Ford to circumvent Tong Pass from {{the west of the}} river. Cao Cao assented to Xu Huang's plan, and sent Zhu Ling to go with him. They crossed Puban and started pitching camps, but before the defence fortification was completed, one of the coalition members, Liang Xing (梁興), scouted them. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> his allies for reinforcement, Liang Xing attacked right away, but was routed in the end. Xu Huang and Zhu Ling then impelled the pace to complete the defence, and waited for the arrival of the main forces. However, the discovery of Xu Huang's presence had alerted the coalition forces and created a serious crisis for Cao Cao's crossing of the river.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{continuum}} of dialects varies, typical features of AAVE grammar include an implicit copula (e.g., She my sister <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> She is my sister), simplification of the possessive form (e.g., my momma sister <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> my mother's sister), and complexification of verb aspects and tenses beyond those of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like I'm a-run, I be running, etc.). Common features of the phonology include non-rhoticity (dropping the r sound {{at the end of}} syllables), metathesis (e.g., aks <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>ask),</b> and simplification <b>of</b> diphthongs (e.g., eye typically sounds like ah).|$|R

25|$|In 62 BC Pompey {{returned}} to Italy {{after winning the}} Third Mithridatic War against Pontus and Armenia (in present-day eastern Turkey) and annexing Syria. He wanted the senate to ratify the acts of the settlements he had made with the kings and cities in the region en bloc. He was opposed by the optimates led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who carried {{the day in the}} senate with the support of Cato the Younger. Pompey had taken over the command of the last phase of that war from Lucullus, who felt that he should have been allowed to continue the war and win it. Moreover, when he took over the command of the war Pompey ignored the settlements Lucullus had already made. Lucullus demanded that Pompey should render account for each act individually and separately <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> for the approval of all his acts at once in a single vote {{as if they were the}} acts of a master. The character of the acts was not known. Each act should be scrutinised, and the senators should ratify those that suited the senate. Appian thought that the optimates, particularly Lucullus, were motivated by jealousy. Crassus cooperated with Lucullus on this matter. Plutarch wrote that when Lucullus {{returned to}} Rome after being relieved from his command the senate hoped that it would find in him an opponent of the tyranny of Pompey and a champion of the aristocracy. However, he withdrew from public affairs. Those who looked on the power of Pompey with suspicion made Crassus and Cato the champions of the senatorial party when Lucullus declined the leadership. Plutarch also wrote that Pompey asked the senate to postpone the consular elections so that he could be in Rome to help Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus to canvass for his candidacy. Cato swayed the senate to reject this. Plutarch also noted that according to some sources since Cato was the major stumbling-block for his ambitions, he asked for Cato’s elder niece's hand for himself and the hand of the younger one, whereas according to other sources he asked for the hand Cato’s daughters. The women were happy with this because of Pompey’s high repute, but Cato thought that this was aimed bribing him by means of a marriage alliance and refused.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his later}} work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three {{distinct}} disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways.

According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others: they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, [...] "separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another." [...] For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>asking</b> traditional questions of identity such as [...] "is it true?"
