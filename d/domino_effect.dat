Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son.

5|$|On {{top of the}} Przeworsk culture's {{internal}} {{crisis situation}} came external pressures, namely the massive migration of peoples. At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a <b>domino</b> <b>effect,</b> as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while {{the weakness of the}} Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part. The paths of this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, {{in the course of the}} 5th century, depopulation of Poland.|$|E

The consequences of these latter are at various levels and may affect not only the industrial sites, but also people, environment and economy. The probability of the <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> is increasingly high due to development in industrial complexes, the proximity of such industrial plant, the storage of dangerous substances and the transportation networks. The diversity of these factors is even more critical that they are often related {{to the emergence of}} new threats that exploit the malicious acts and human error. Although the literature abounds in several studies on <b>domino</b> <b>effects,</b> it is necessary to deepen their analysis, and pay more attention to their modeling.

Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{introduced}} a methodology based on graph theory and multicriteria decision analysis for cost-effective fire protection of chemical plants subject to fire-induced <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> By modeling <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> in chemical plants as a directed graph, the graph centrality {{measures such as}} out-closeness and betweenness scores {{can be used to}} identify the installations playing a key role in initiating and propagating potential <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> It is demonstrated that active fire protection of installations with the highest out-closeness score and passive fire protection of installations with the highest betweenness score are the most effective strategies for reducing the vulnerability of chemical plants to fire-induced <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> We have employed a dynamic graph analysis to investigate the impact of both the availability and the degradation of fire protection measures over time on the vulnerability of chemical plants.

40|$|Chains of accidents, in {{literature}} generally {{referred to as}} <b>domino</b> <b>effects,</b> knock-on effects, cascade effects or escalation effects occur very infrequently but with disastrous consequences. There exist very few software packages to study such domino accidents in complex industrial areas and to forecast potential catastrophes caused by secondary order (involving a sequence of three installations submitted to two consecutive accidents), tertiary order or even higher order accidents. Moreover, available domino software focuses on risk assessment and on consequence assessment. None of these toolkits specifically addresses the prioritization of installation sequences in an industrial area {{in order to facilitate}} objective prevention decisions about <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> This paper describes the application of a new computer-automated tool designed to support decision-making on preventive and protective measures to alleviate <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> in a complex surrounding of chemical installations. Using a holistic approach and thus looking at the entire industrial area as a whole, all sequences of three installations in the area are ranked according to their danger contribution to <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> An example of a cluster of chemical plants demonstrates the level of qualitative and quantitative input data required.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite the {{remarkable}} severity of <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> in activities at major hazard, a complete methodology analysing such events {{has not been}} developed and integrated within Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA). Such a deficiency appears to be particularly remarkable for <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> triggered by the projection of fragments. The aim of the present work is therefore to propose a systematic procedure for the quantification of <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> due to fragments projection within QRA. To achieve this objective, the deterministic approach for the estimation of the realistic trajectory of fragments is entirely reviewed. In order to incorporate such a reviewed approach within the standard QRA, a probabilistic model for the impact probability of the fragments is developed by applying a Monte-Carlo method to the trajectory equations. The validation of the proposed framework is carried out by using the data related to an accident occurred in 1993 in the oil refinery of Milazzo (Italy) ...|$|R

The lesson from the current crisis is very clear: The Eurozone faces the serious risk of economic and fiscal <b>domino</b> <b>effects.</b> We see that shocks and fiscal imbalances in one country affect other Eurozone countries more quickly and more strongly than initially thought.

Labor migrants are typically more mobile than the native population. Hence, labor mobility could help to avoid the <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> we are currently experiencing. Nevertheless, mobility remains low in Europe. This is even more surprising given the huge differences in unemployment rates between Eurozone countries.
