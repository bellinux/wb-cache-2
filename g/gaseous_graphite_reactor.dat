50|$|A <b>graphite</b> <b>reactor</b> is {{a nuclear}} reactor that uses carbon as a neutron moderator, which allows un-enriched uranium {{to be used as}} nuclear fuel.|$|R
50|$|Although catastrophic {{behaviour}} such as fusion or crumbling of graphite pieces {{has never}} occurred, large changes in many properties do result from fast neutron irradiation which {{need to be}} taken into account when graphite components of nuclear reactors are designed. Although not all effects are well understood yet, more than 100 <b>graphite</b> <b>reactors</b> have successfully operated in the last 60 years. A few severe accidents in <b>graphite</b> <b>reactors</b> can in no case be attributed to a lack of knowledge or insufficient properties of the graphite in use.|$|R

5000|$|Of {{historical}} significance: The world's first {{nuclear power}} generated electricity {{was produced in}} September 1948 with the X-10 <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor</b> in Oak Ridge National Labs, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where among other firsts, this first ever electricity generated by nuclear power occurred utilizing a Jensen #50 steam engine and generator. A miniature atomic power plant was operating and generating electricity on September 3, 1948 per records at ORNL.gov. The #50 was the largest model engine and generator made by Jensen Manufacturing Co of Jeannette, PA. That Jensen #50 and generator are still there in the <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor</b> building and still on the same shelf they were mounted on in 1948. That shelf with the engine {{is now part of}} a kiosk display in the visitor area in front of the loading face of the X-10 <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor.</b> While the power generated here was only about 3 volts, enough to light a flashlight bulb, it did occur in Oak Ridge in 1948 with a Jensen Steam Engine and generator. The makeshift boiling water reactor that these engineers built also became the test bed for the light water reactors used today.|$|R

ORNL on the Oak Ridge Reservation in East Tennessee at the Anderson and Roane County lines, approximately 38 km (24 miles) west of Knoxville, Tennessee, and 18 km (11 miles) southwest of downtown Oak Ridge. The Oak Ridge <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor</b> and its storage and transfer canal are located in Bldg. 3001 in the approximate center of Waste Area Grouping I in the ORNL main complex. 4 : 1 The Bldg. 3001 Storage Canal is an L-shaped, underground, reinforced-concrete structure running from the back and below the <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor</b> in Bldg. 3001 to a location beneath a hot cell in the adjacent Bldg. 3019. The <b>Graphite</b> <b>Reactor</b> was built in 1943 to produce small quantities of plutonium and was subsequently used to produce other isotopes for medical research before it was finally shut down in 1963. The associated canal was used to transport, under water, spent fuel slugs and other isotopes {{from the back of}} the reactor to the adjacent Bldg. 31319 hot cell for further processing. During its operation and years subsequent to operation, the canal`s concrete walls and floor became contaminated with radioisotopes from the water.
