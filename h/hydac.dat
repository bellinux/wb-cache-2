50|$|Hybrid {{computers}} are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally {{serves as the}} controller and provides logical and numerical operations, while the analog component often serves as a solver of differential equations and other mathematically complex equations. The first desktop hybrid computing system was the Hycomp 250, released by Packard Bell in 1961. Another early example was the <b>HYDAC</b> 2400, an integrated hybrid computer released by EAI in 1963. Late in the 20th century, hybrids dwindled with the increasing capabilities of digital computers including digital signal processors.|$|E
