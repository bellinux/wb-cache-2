40|$|Various {{research}} groups {{across the globe}} have developed models for engine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis based on the data from steady state performance measurements {{over the last two}} decade. However, these performance data are not amenable for easy collection in some situations and some of the data may show little performance deviation at the steady state conditions of operation. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify engine operating conditions and parameters that can be used to develop a diagnostic tool for internal combustion (CI) engine running on biodiesel blends fuel. Ricardo Wave Software was used to stimulate healthy and degraded engine. The degraded condition of operation was created by forcing one injector to work with 90 %, 80 % and 70 % of the normal fuel flow efficiency. The measurable performance parameters such as brake power, brake torque and exhaust temperature and CO emission have been used to compare the deviations during steady and transient condition. From the comparison of the data obtained from transient and steady state simulation of the engine with and without injector fault, it can be concluded that the transient parameters show higher deviations and hence are better suited for condition monitoring and diagnostic modelling in <b>engine</b> <b>working</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|E
40|$|NOx {{is one of}} {{the major}} toxic {{emissions}} that needs to be regulated stringently in both EU and USA emission regulations. The engine designer is keen to get an accurate, reliable and cost effective NOx measurement system. In this paper, the application of the cylinder pressure for predicting the NOx emission of compression ignition (CI) engine fuelled with diesel and biodiesel during steady state operations is carried out. To address the problem, an experimental work was conducted on four-cylinder, turbo-charged, four-stroke and direct-injection CI engine which was fuelled with diesel and biodiesel blends. During the experiment, the main parameters consisting of in-cylinder pressure, fuel flow rate, air flow rate, and the NOx emission, were measured. The temperature within the cylinder was predicted using the cylinder pressure and air flow rate. Using the temperature values, the NOx emission was simulated in the Zeldovich extended mechanism. The simulation result was then compared with the measured one for a range of engine operating conditions. The models were shown to produce consistent results with the measured one for a range of <b>engine</b> <b>working</b> <b>speeds</b> and loads...|$|R

60|$|On the 4th of August the gunboats El Teb and Tamai {{approached}} the Fourth Cataract to ascend to the Abu Hamed-Berber {{reach of the}} river. Major David {{was in charge of}} the operation. Lieutenants Hood and Beatty (Royal Navy) commanded the vessels. Two hundred men of the 7th Egyptians were towed in barges to assist in hauling the steamers in the difficult places. The current was, however, too strong, and it was found necessary to leave three barges, containing 160 soldiers, at the foot of the rapids. Nevertheless, as the cataract was not considered a very formidable barrier, Major David determined to make the attempt. Early on the 5th, therefore, the Tamai tried the ascent. About 300 local Shaiggia tribesmen had been collected, and their efforts were directed--or, as the result proved, mis-directed--by those few of the Egyptian soldiers who had not been left behind. The steamer, with her <b>engines</b> <b>working</b> at full <b>speed,</b> succeeded in mounting half the distance. But the rush of water was then so great that her bows were swept round, and, after a narrow escape of capsizing, she was carried swiftly down the stream.|$|R

The tests are conducted using each of the above fuel blends or neat diesel fuel, with the <b>engine</b> <b>working</b> at a <b>speed</b> of 2000 rpm and at four different loads. In each test, combustion chamber and fuel injection pressure diagrams are obtained using a specially developed, high-speed, data acquisition and processing system. A heat release analysis of the experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams is developed and used, with the pertinent application of the energy and state equations. From the analysis results, plots of the history in the combustion chamber of the gross heat release rate and other related parameters reveal some very interesting features, which {{shed light on the}} combustion mechanism when using these blends. Moreover, for each test, volumetric fuel consumption, exhaust smokiness and exhaust regulated gas emissions are measured. The differences in the performance and exhaust emission parameters from the baseline operation of the diesel engine, i. e., when working with neat diesel fuel, are determined and compared. The heat release analysis results for the relevant combustion mechanism, combined with the widely differing physical and chemical properties of the ethanol against those for the diesel fuel, are used to aid the correct interpretation of the observed engine behavior.

More specifically, a high variety of vegetable oils or bio-diesels of various origins are tested as supplements, i. e. cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and their corresponding methyl esters, as well as rapeseed oil methyl ester, palm oil methyl ester, corn oil and olive kernel oil.

From the first measurement, specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency are computed. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters from the baseline operation of the engine, i. e. when working with neat Diesel fuel, are determined and compared.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of this {{dissertation}} the evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters for the basic soil cultivation using showels with different edge thickness was carried out. Field evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters of sets for soil cultivation was done with tractor John Deer 7810 + combined loosener. The comparison of energy and efficiency parameters of the sets using showels having average edge thickness 2, 16 mm, 4, 17 mm and 6, 23 mm was done. Two variants of the engine performance A and B were selected. A variant: A full supply of fuel was selected, using shift gears the motor was kept in the revolution limit of 1600 - 2000 min- 1. B variant: Before the ride the fuel supply was set {{in the way that}} the revolutions of unloaded engine were 1800 min- 1. Shifting the motor gears the range of revolutions was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. Shifting the motor gears the range of revolutions was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the thickness of the loosener edge and the working regime of the tractor engine on energic and efficiency parameters. The data could be concluded in following way: By increasing the tension resistance due to the showel thickness by the determined <b>working</b> <b>engine</b> regimes the <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> was lowered and this way the efficiency of the working set as well; The fuel reduction and higher efficiency could be reached by the suitable selection of the shape and dimensions of the working machine parts used for soil cultivation and good technical working conditions; Areal efficiency by the fixed <b>engine</b> <b>working</b> regimes is influenced by the depth of cultivation, thus the value of energic parameters were calculated in the relation of the soil cultivated; Linear course of the edge thickness on the energy demand of the soil cultivation was proved by both laboratory and field tests; When suggesting a suitable set, i. e. the selection of suitable tractor for a given machine it is necessary to consider its working resistance and tension power in relation to the given soil conditions; From values obtained the so called economy regime, when the engine works with the specific fuel consumption, is obvious; When it is not possible to use full performance of the tractor engine it is convenient to change the working regime of the engine by lowering the fuel supply on the presumption that agrotechnical demands on the particular operations will be carried out. On the basic of the presented thesis with the aim of establishing the effect of edge thickness of the working parts of the loosener and effect of the tractor motor working regime on the energic demand of the soil cultivation some other questions appeared. Their study is the subject of future research. They are listed here: Study of the effects of the shape and dimension changes of the working parts of soil cultivation machinery on the energic demand of the given operation; Establishing the optimal <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> considering the quality of labour and minimal speed of wear; Establishing the minimal thickness of the soil machinery working parts edge considering the maximal durability of the working parts and minimal specific resistance; Establishing the optimal regime of the engine performance in relation to the fuel consumption and efficiency of the set.
