25|$|While the {{earliest}} microprocessor ICs literally contained only the processor, i.e. the central processing unit, of a computer, their progressive development naturally led to chips containing {{most or all}} of the internal <b>electronic</b> <b>parts</b> of a computer. The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an Intel 8742, is an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip.|$|E
25|$|Several {{open source}} modchips were {{designed}} using readily available <b>electronic</b> <b>parts,</b> {{by the end}} of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs.|$|E

The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{researchers}} at Fort Monmouth grew the first synthetically produced large quartz crystals. The crystals {{were able to}} be used in the manufacture of electronic components, and made the United States largely independent of foreign imports for this critical mineral. In 1949 the first auto-assembly of printed circuits was invented. A technique for assembling <b>electronic</b> <b>parts</b> on a printed circuit board, developed by Fort Monmouth engineers, pioneered the development and fabrication of miniature circuits for both military and civilian use. Although they did not invent the transistor, Fort Monmouth scientists were among the first to recognize its importance, particularly in military applications, and did pioneer significant improvements in its composition and production.|$|E
25|$|The Heath Company {{was founded}} as an {{aircraft}} company in 1912 by Edward Bayard Heath with {{the purchase of}} Bates Aeroplane Co, soon renamed to the E.B. Heath Aerial Vehicle Co. Starting in 1926 it sold a light aircraft, the Heath Parasol, in kit form. Heath died during a 1931 test flight. The company reorganized and moved from Chicago to Niles, Michigan. In 1935, Howard Anthony purchased the then-bankrupt Heath Company, and focused on selling accessories for small aircraft. After World War II, Anthony decided that entering the electronics industry was a good idea, and bought a large stock of surplus wartime <b>electronic</b> <b>parts</b> {{with the intention of}} building kits with them. In 1947, Heath introduced its first electronic kit, the O1 oscilloscope that sold for US$50â€”the price was unbeatable at the time, and the oscilloscope went on to be a huge seller.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not long}} before major {{corporations}} started taking an interest in computer graphics. TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive <b>electronic</b> <b>parts,</b> it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked {{for the next five years}} as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.|$|E
40|$|We just commemorated the 10 years {{anniversary of}} the {{discovery}} of the high T-c superconductivity of Bednorz and Muller (BM). In their celebrated paper BM mentioned the possible role of the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the enhancement of the transition temperature to the superconducting state. In the present work we analize, under the quasi-molecular approximation, the conditions for the existence of the JT effect in the CuO 6 cluster belonging to the La-Ba-Cu-O superconductor of BM. The <b>electronic</b> <b>part</b> is obtained from self consistent ab initio calculations and the force constants are calculated taking the second derivatives of the energy using the Hartree-Fock approximation for the <b>electronic</b> <b>part.</b> Both, the <b>electronic</b> and vibrational <b>parts</b> are classified accordingly to the irreducible representations of the D- 4 h group in order to establish the JT theorem.

500|$|The {{design of}} the Borg were {{reminiscent}} of Lord Dread from the television series Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future and the designs of H. R. Giger. The first designs for the new race were created by costume designer Dorinda Wood after she received the script to [...] "Q Who". While her design showed a suit with tubes running {{in and out of}} it, she left the head design up to make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. The headpieces and the main costumes were made at the same time by the two different departments, with Wood and Westmore working together at times to ensure that they matched. The base of the head pieces was made from foam, and while Westmore initially made casts of model kits using polyurethane for the <b>electronic</b> <b>parts,</b> he found it more effective to use actual electronics from damaged equipment. He designed a latex attachment to allow for tubes to be attached to skin so that there was not a great deal of bare skin left on the actors' bodies. That skin was covered in a white base make-up in order to achieve a zombie-like appearance.|$|E

2500|$|Moisture {{absorption}} {{occurs when}} the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for [...] "popcorning" [...] damage on wet packaging of <b>electronic</b> <b>parts.</b> Careful baking of the substrates may be required.|$|E
40|$|Mismatches between <b>electronic</b> <b>part</b> {{procurement}} lifecycles and the lifecycles of {{the products}} they are used in causes products with long manufacturing and/or support lives to suffer from significant obsolescence management costs. Lifetime buy is a prevalent mitigation approach employed for <b>electronic</b> <b>part</b> obsolescence management. Making lifetime purchases of parts upon obsolescence involves managing interacting influences and concurrent buys for multiple parts in a sequential manner. This thesis is focused on optimizing lifetime buy quantities by minimizing lifecycle cost. The Life of Type Evaluation (LOTE) tool was created to optimize lifetime buy quantities. LOTE requires component and system data and expected demand information. With the given data, LOTE uses stochastic analysis to determine the lifetime buy quantity per part that minimizes the lifecycle cost for the system. Results from a LOTE analysis of a Motorola communication system indicate that organizations may be systematically overbuying at lifetime buys giving inventory shortage penalties a greater emphasis than other hidden costs...|$|R
