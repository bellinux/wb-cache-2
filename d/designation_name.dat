50|$|The EL84 is a {{thermionic}} valve {{of the power}} pentode type. It has a 9 pin Noval base and is used mainly in the power output stages of audio amplification circuits, most commonly now in guitar amplifiers, but originally in radios and many other devices of the pre-transistor era. The EL84 is smaller and more sensitive than the octal 6V6 that was widely used around the world until the 1960s. An interchangeable North American type is the 6BQ5 (the RETMA tube <b>designation</b> <b>name</b> for the EL84).|$|E

50|$|The {{anti-tank}} {{grenade launcher}} was originally developed around 1960 {{and put into}} service by the Bundeswehr shortly thereafter. It was developed to provide West German infantry with a modern replacement for the Bazooka that they had previously used. As such, {{it was the first}} German antitank rocket developed after World War II, a conflict in which German hand-held antitank weapons such as the Panzerfaust played a prominent role during 1944-45. The Lanze was a product of a period in which the German army was re-equipped with locally developed arms and equipment and retired the aging U.S. gear that had formed their initial arsenal. The full <b>designation</b> <b>name</b> by the German Army is Panzerfaust 44mm DM2 Ausführung 1 Lanze.|$|E

50|$|Other Sri Lankan rulers whose {{military}} achievements {{stand out}} include King Gajabâhu (113 AD), who sailed to India {{to bring back}} his captured soldiers, and King Dhatusena (433) who is credited with repulsing numerous Indian invasions and for organising a naval build-up to deter seaborne attacks. He also {{had the foresight to}} cover his defences with artillery. Vijayabâhu I (1001) was another warrior king who dislodged Indian invaders and united the country. Parakramabahu the Great (1153) was an outstanding monarch of the Polonnaruwa period of Sri Lankan history, and his accomplishments as a military leader and a great administrator are noteworthy. His reign included a military expedition to Burma (Myanmar) in retaliation for indignities inflicted on his envoys and Burmese interference in the elephant trade. This marked the first overseas expedition in Sri Lankan military history. It is also reported that Parakramabahu's fame was such that his assistance was sought by South Indian rulers who were involved in internecine struggles. Another strong ruler in the pre-colonial era was Parâkramabâhu VI, who defeated Indian invaders, united the island and ruled it from capital Sri Jayawardhanapura, Kotte.Although the known epigraphical records do not indicate that the Sri Lankan rulers had a full-time standing army at their disposal, there is evidence supported by legend, <b>designation,</b> <b>name,</b> place and tradition that prove there were 'stand-by' equestrian, elephant, and infantry divisions to ensure royal authority at all times.

30|$|The “main ingredient” {{definition}} is fundamental for the standardisation of COOL. Eleven experts {{agreed with the}} threshold of 50 %, {{and some of them}} provided further considerations. All the answers can be summarised as follows: “Main ingredient means over 50 %” is currently the most popular definition. However, the percentage should be defined better according to the characteristics of the ingredient, referring to the presence by weight in the final product (excluding water). The definition of “characterising ingredient” could be “appearance in the food <b>designation</b> (<b>name)</b> or be associated with the food designation, presence in words or pictures on the label”. To avoid misleading consumers, the minimum percentage of “characterising ingredient” should also be defined in accordance with other non-COOL regulations (e.g. that about advertising).|$|E
