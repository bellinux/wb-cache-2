Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper Naționalul, consequently pressured Stere to indicate who Șărcăleanu was ("We wish to know him, does he wear sidelocks or <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> Judaisized Romanian?"). Similar calls were voiced by Vieața, who alleged that Stere himself was a Russian Jew.|$|E

500|$|The game {{begins and}} Stanley {{proves to be}} a horrible player. Furthermore, Michael cannot make a shot, nor <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> fan of passing or defending. Upon gaining {{possession}} of the ball, Michael fools around and intentionally acts stupid to tease the opponents, which results in Roy Anderson (David Denman) snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. Despite the fact that Michael {{is the one who}} foolishly lost the ball, he blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. As Jim begins to show his prowess at the game, Roy and Jim gradually become aggressive toward each other, with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) looking on. At a crucial point in the game, Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a [...] "flagrant personal intentional foul". He pettily stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. As everybody returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills.|$|E
500|$|Cook reads {{further into}} the concept of child {{empowerment}} in Joe 90, writing that the series creates a [...] "technological utopia" [...] around youth, remarking, [...] "Through the character of Joe, his brain hardwired {{at the start of}} each episode into the BIG RAT supercomputer, the young are shown to be literally at one with technology." [...] He adds that the instant access to brain patterns that the BIG RAT affords to Joe may be interpreted as heralding the development of the Internet over a decade after Joe 90 was produced. With his intellectual horizons broadened, Joe becomes the manifestation of homo superior, yet his youthfulness grants him the power to change the fraught political world in ways that no adult could due to the limitations of their imagination. In this respect, Cook holds up Joe 90 as a precursor to the 1970s television series The Tomorrow People, which also concerned ideas of human transcendence in children. This idea, Cook says, was evident in the title of Joe 90 itself: [...] "no longer <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> nine-year-old boy but instead his status and capacities have been multiplied tenfold to transform him into agent 'Joe 90', his name an appealing futuristic echo of the then distant year of 1990." ...|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{credited}} Richthofen with {{shooting down}} Ball, {{but there is}} some doubt as to what happened, especially as Richthofen's claim was for a Sopwith Triplane, not an S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the amount of propaganda the German High Command generated touting the younger Richthofen, a high-level decision may have been taken to attribute Ball's death to him. It is probable that Ball was not shot down at all, but had become disoriented and lost control during his final combat, the victim of a form of temporary vertigo that has claimed other pilots. [...] Ball's squadron harboured hopes that he was a prisoner of war, and the British government officially listed him as [...] "missing" [...] on 18 May. There was much speculation in the press; in France, the Havas news agency reported: [...] "Albert Ball, the star of aviators... has been missing since the 7th May. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>a</b> prisoner or has he been killed? If he is dead, he died fighting for his forty-fifth victory." [...] It was only {{at the end of the}} month that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines announcing that Ball was dead, and had been buried in Annoeullin with full military honours two days after he crashed. Over the grave of the man they dubbed [...] "the English Richthofen", the Germans erected a cross bearing the inscription In Luftkampf gefallen für sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps ("Fallen in air combat for his fatherland English pilot Captain Albert Ball").|$|E
