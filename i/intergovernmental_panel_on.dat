30|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the <b>Intergovernmental</b> Technical <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> Soils (ITPS) have {{recently}} identified soil pollution {{as one of}} the ten major soil threats listed in the 2015 Status of the World’s Soil Resources report [35].

There is an urgent need to eliminate pollution sources and to control, secure and remediate contaminated sites and reservoirs, to reduce exposure and guarantee food safety.

We need to increase nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use in infertile tropical and semi-tropical soils – the regions where the most food insecure among us are found – while reducing global use of these products overall. Stores of soil organic carbon are critical in the global carbon balance, and national governments must set specific targets to stabilize or ideally increase soil organic carbon stores. Finally the quality of soil information available for policy formulation must be improved – the regional assessments in the SWSR report frequently base their evaluations on studies from the 1990 s based on observations made in the 1980 s or earlier.

40|$|Soils {{underpin}} {{our existence}} through food production {{and represent the}} largest terrestrial carbon store. Understanding soil state-and-change in response to climate and land use change is a major challenge. Our aim is to bridge the science-policy interface by developing a natural capital accounting structure for soil, for example, attempting a mass balance between soil erosion and production, which indicates that barren land, and woody crop areas are most vulnerable to potential soil loss. We test out our approach using earth observation, modelling and ground based sample data from the European Union’s Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) soil monitoring program. Using land cover change data for 2000 – 2012 {{we are able to}} identify land covers susceptible to change, and the soil resources most at risk. Tree covered soils are associated with the highest carbon stocks, and are on the increase, while areas of arable crops are declining, but artificial surfaces are increasing.

40|$|The {{societal}} responses {{required to}} achieve sustainable soil management are complex and many-faceted. The implementation of soil management decisions is typically made locally and occurs within widely differing socio-economic contexts. The development of specific measures appropriate for adoption by local decision-makers requires multi-level, interdisciplinary initiatives by many stakeholders – partnerships are therefore essential. In recognition of this, the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was established {{by members of the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Its <b>Intergovernmental</b> Technical <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> Soils (ITPS) was established at the first Plenary Assembly of the GSP in June 2013. After two years of work, the ITPS is publishing the first ever comprehensive State of the World’s Soil Resources report (SWSR). The goal of the SWSR is to make clear the essential connections between human well-being and the soil. The report provides a benchmark against which the world’s collective progress to conserve this essential resource can be measured. About 200 soil scientists from 60 countries contributed directly to the report. Their assessment has synthesized the scientific knowledge embodied in more than 2, 000 peer-reviewed scientific publications. The report provides a global perspective on {{the current state of the}} soil, its role in providing ecosystem services, and the threats to its continued contribution to these services. The specific threats to soil function considered in the report are erosion, compaction, acidification, contamination, sealing, salinization, waterlogging, nutrient imbalance (i. e., both nutrient deficiency and nutrient excess), and losses of soil organic carbon and of biodiversity.

This paper provides an initial assessment of this new path for key vulnerabilities climate change and its implications for policy. We project greenhouse gas emissions based on current policies to 2030, with a minimum achievable emissions path assuming aggressive reductions after 2030; probabilities for global mean temperature to 2100 are estimated using a simple climate model for climate outcomes and applied to damage probabilities for four key vulnerabilities. Five conclusions are reached. First, CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion are projected to grow by 3. 1 % per annum over 2004 – 2030. This is well above any of the <b>Intergovernmental</b> <b>on</b> <b>Panel</b> Change’s (IPCC) Special Report for Emission Scenarios (SRES) marker scenarios, which are no longer a reliable tool for medium term analysis in the new economy.
