5|$|In a {{flashback}} to the 1950s, Dales (Fredric Lane) {{and his partner}} Hayes Michel are sent to arrest Skur (Garret Dillahunt) for being a communist. When Dales is told that Skur hanged himself while in custody, he feels guilty and returns to Skur's house to apologize to his wife. While there, he sees Skur alive and tries to recapture him. In the following struggle, an appendage emerges from Skur's mouth. Skur is forced to flee when a neighbor interrupts the fight. Dales' partner and Roy Cohn warn Dales to change his report about the attack. He does so, but feels <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bornheimer {{was cast}} in the {{recurring}} role by October 2014, {{as part of the}} series [...] "stocking up on male counterparts" [...] for Carter to deal with throughout the series. In terms of costume designe, Ottobre-Melton described Krzeminski as [...] "a bit of a slob with his sport jacket, and open collar shirts." [...] After the character's death, Butters explained that Carter would feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> moving forward, as it was her decisions that [...] "inadvertently put Krzeminski at risk". His death also affected the series in general, with Fazekas explaining, [...] "The stakes have changed now, they’ve gotten a lot more serious. The episodes that come subsequently really reflect that".|$|E
500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on the woman {{at the center of the}} charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E
50|$|Children {{may be used}} {{to exert}} control by the abuser {{threatening}} to take the children or making them feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> the children. <b>It</b> could include harassing them during visitation or using the children to relay messages. Another controlling tactic is abusing pets.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of this movement, several {{cultural}} works, including many identified above, were considered elements of [...] "new sincerity", but this was also seen to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of Wired saw this as having being able to enjoy one's guilty pleasures without having to feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> enjoying <b>it,</b> and being able to share that appreciation with others.|$|R
50|$|Natalie, at {{the close}} of the novel, has moved to a new hotel with her family and things are going well but while her family, old teachers, and old {{community}} all criticise and dislike Tulip, Natalie knows she will remember Tulip for the rest of her life and always feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> her. <b>It</b> is clear that at the time of her friendship with Tulip, Natalie was too young to recognise the signs of abuse but wonders why adults who seem to have known the same thing never helped Tulip.|$|R
500|$|Marge is a caring, understanding, and {{nurturing}} parent to Bart, but {{she refers to}} him as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (season seven, 1995), {{she felt she was}} mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her [...] "over-mothering", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." [...] Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. In [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] (season four, 1992) When Marge was playing the role of Blanche DuBois, she hit Ned Flanders naked with a bottle and she tells him 'What's this bottle in your face!'.|$|E
500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really going to be quite shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're back in that moment when he was dragged away from her. She really did fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{his friend}} and I, Me, Mine editor Derek Taylor in 1979, Harrison said of the episode: [...] "I don't feel <b>guilty</b> or bad <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> in fact it saved many a heroin addict's life. I know the motive behind writing the song {{in the first place}} and its effect far {{exceeded}} the legal hassle." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Walker said, [...] "The lyric and content have become a lot more positive. Strait's 'Check Yes or No'--very positive; my song 'Rumor Has It'--very positive. When I do a concert, I can sing for 3- and 4- and 5-year-old kids and not have a <b>guilty</b> conscience <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I don't {{want to go out}} there and depress people. I want them to smile and feel good and feel the way I feel. We don't live that long, and that's one thing that having MS made me realize. My God, you need to love your family, you need to love your friends, and you don't need to carry bitterness in your heart because you don't live that doggone long. That's about as simple as I can say it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian in November 2006, David acknowledged that owning two homes {{on opposite sides of}} the country and flying in a private jet several times per year is at odds with her message to others. In the interview she notes [...] "Yes, I take a private plane on holiday a couple of times a year, and I feel horribly <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I probably shouldn't do it. But the truth is, I'm not perfect. This is not about perfection. I don't expect anybody else to be perfect either. That's what hurts the environmental movement – holding people to a standard they cannot meet. That just pushes people away." ...|$|E
5000|$|The storyline to [...] "One Last Dance" [...] was {{somewhat}} {{based on the}} Iranian Embassy Siege, {{which took place in}} London on May 1980. Writer Simon Mirren noted the episode was hard to write, since he had to add two main storylines and tie them together - the Consulate siege and the bank robbery. Mirren was concerned that adding too much dialogue explaining certain aspects of the storyline would make the episode [...] "silly". In the original pitch of the consulate siege, the terrorists were to abseil down from the roof, but was changed in favour of a ground assault. The police officer in the Consulate, Steven Burrows, was originally written to conceal a gun, and feeling <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> never using <b>it,</b> but was cut.|$|R
500|$|... "Did It Again" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira for her eighth studio album, She Wolf (2009). It was released on 16 October 2009, by Epic Records, as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Shakira, with additional songwriting and production from Pharrell Williams and The Neptunes, respectively. There is an alternate version vocals from American recording artist Kid Cudi, while its Spanish-language version [...] "Lo Hecho Está Hecho" [...] (...) includes additional lyrical contributions from Uruguayan musician Jorge Drexler. [...] "Did It Again" [...] is an electropop song with elements of samba. Lyrically, it details Shakira's involvement in a man's extramarital affair, which leads to her feeling <b>guilty</b> and hurt <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Firemen {{frequently}} pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, {{reduced to}} a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves {{of at least two}} innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. [...] "The times I did a one-inning save, I felt <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It's like it was too easy", said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be [...] "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities". It also noted that blown saves are [...] "non-qualitative", pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, [...] "But {{you have to be a}} great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [...] saved many, many more than he did not save." [...] More than half of Gossage's and Fingers' blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. [...] The pitchers need to get out of the initial situation and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more [...] "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered [...] "praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings." ...|$|E
