2500|$|In 2007, Williams {{teamed with}} {{retailer}} Steve & Barry's to launch her own fashion line, EleVen. [...] "I love fashion {{and the idea}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> my design education to actually create clothing and footwear that I will wear on and off the tennis court is a dream come true for me. The vision has been to create a collection that will allow women to enjoy an active lifestyle while remaining fashionable at the same time. I'm thrilled with everything we've created to launch EleVen." [...] Venus's line, EleVen made its debut at the 2012 New York fashion week. It was modeled by athletes as opposed to models, a choice made by Venus herself to feature the sort of people the line was designed for. She flaunts her vibrant outfits each time she steps on the court.|$|E
2500|$|At present, I am {{particularly}} {{excited by}} [...] "bad taste." [...] I have the deep {{feeling that there}} exists in {{the very essence of}} bad taste a power capable of creating those things situated far beyond what is traditionally termed [...] "The Work of Art." [...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very recently I have become a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> the very terms of my enemies). Some of my latest works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high. I use these to bathe the surface of the painting {{in such a way that}} it registered the spontaneous trace of fire.|$|E
2500|$|... 'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. Did {{he do that}} because it {{made it easier to}} play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

I think I am still better to-day than I was yesterday; but I am far from strong, and have no appetite. To see me at my little table at night, you would think me the freshest of the fresh. And this is the marvel of Fields' life.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes Pupkin would swear off {{and keep}} away from the cursed thing for weeks, and then perhaps he'd see by sheer {{accident}} a pile of matches on the table, or a match {{lying on the floor}} and it would start the craze in him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> his own words--a [...] "craze"--that's what he called it when he told Miss Lawson all about it, and she promised to cure him of it.

Of our {{powers in}} {{historical}} sculpture, I am, without question, just, in taking for sufficient evidence the monuments we have erected to our two greatest heroes by sea and land; namely, the Nelson Column, and {{the statue of}} the Duke of Wellington opposite Apsley House. Nor will you, I hope, think me severe,--certainly, whatever you may think me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> only the most temperate language, in saying of both these monuments, that they are absolutely devoid of high sculptural merit. But consider how much {{is involved in the}} fact thus dispassionately stated, respecting the two monuments in the principal places of our capital, to our two greatest heroes.|$|E
60|$|I take it {{that the}} whole object of {{education}} is, in the first place, to train the faculties of the young {{in such a manner}} as to give their possessors the best chance of being happy [79] and useful in their generation; and, in the second place, to furnish them with the most important portions of that immense capitalised experience of the human race which we call knowledge of various kinds. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> the term knowledge in its widest possible sense; and the question is, what subjects to select by training and discipline, in which the object I have just defined may be best attained.|$|E

You must feel, however, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> {{the word}} [...] "engraving" [...] in a {{somewhat}} different, and, you may imagine, a wider, sense, than that which you are accustomed to attach to it. So {{far from being a}} wider sense, it is in reality a more accurate and restricted one, while yet it embraces every conceivable right application of the art. And I wish, in this first lecture, to make entirely clear to you the proper meaning of the word, and proper range of the art of, engraving; in my next following lecture, to show you its place in Italian schools, and then, in due order, the place it ought to take in our own, and in all schools.|$|E

Because;' {{here was}} {{something}} to demonstrate, and it set him up again; 'because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on {{the sense in which}} we use the expression. Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>using</b> synonymous terms) sentimental. Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground. Therefore, perhaps the expression itself - I merely suggest this to you, my dear - may be a little misplaced.' ...|$|E

But I can only produce a work of art, when irresistible impulse urges me to express my thoughts in form and color.

I can only write when the fit takes me--sometimes at night when I ought to be asleep; sometimes at meals when I ought to be handling my knife and fork; sometimes out of doors when I meet with inquisitive strangers who stare at me.

They would, indeed, be unjustifiable, if, spoken {{from this}} chair, they were violent at all. They are, unhappily, {{temperate}} and accurate,--except in shortcoming of blame. For {{we are not}} only impotent to restore, but strong to defile, the work of past ages. Of the impotence, take but this one, utterly humiliatory, and, in the full meaning of it, ghastly, example. We have lately been busy embanking, {{in the capital of}} the country, the river which, of all its waters, the imagination of our ancestors had made most sacred, and the bounty of nature most useful. Of all architectural features of the metropolis, that embankment will be, in future, the most conspicuous; and in its position and purpose it was the most capable of noble adornment.|$|E
