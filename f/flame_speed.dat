He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased <b>flame</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and that he}} could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce the distance that the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.|$|E

The results indicate that cyclohexane/air flames propagate somewhat faster than mono-alkylated cyclohexane/air flames. Flames of mono-alkylated cyclohexane compounds were found to have similar laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speeds,</b> from methylcyclohexane to n-butylcyclohexane, suggesting that the different alkyl groups have a secondary effect on flame propagation. The experiments were modeled using JetSurF (version 1. 1) - a detailed kinetic model for the combustion of cyclohexane and its derivatives. Both experiment and model show satisfactory agreement with each other. Based on the analysis of the model results, the somewhat lower rates of mono-alkylated cyclohexane flame propagation are attributed to the greater production of propene and allyl and the increased H-atom scavenging by these C 3 intermediates. Though these fuel-specific reaction kinetic features do not limit the overall oxidation rates, the distribution of the cracked products do exert influences on flame propagation, leading to the subtle differences in the laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> observed experimentally. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

40|$|Abstract 2 -Methylfuran (MF) {{has become}} very {{attractive}} due to the recent breakthrough in its production method using the process of dehydration and hydrogenolysis of fructose. MF–gasoline blended fuel has been considered as a potential choice of alternative fuel pathway for spark ignition (SI) engines, as have other biofuel blends. Isooctane is used to represent gasoline in fundamental studies of gasoline blended fuels, however, {{little is known about}} the laminar burning characteristics of MF–isooctane blended fuels. In this study, high-speed schlieren photography is used to investigate the laminar burning characteristics of gaseous MF–isooctane at varying temperatures and equivalence ratios with an initial pressure of 0. 1 MPa in a constant-volume vessel. The outwardly spherical flame method is used to determine the stretched <b>flame</b> <b>speeds.</b> The un-stretched <b>flame</b> <b>speeds,</b> Markstein lengths, Markstein number, laminar burning velocities and laminar burning flux of MF 20 (20 % MF and 80 % isooctane) and MF 50 (50 % MF and 50 % isooctane) under different equivalence ratios and temperatures are then deduced and compared to MF and isooctane. The results show that the un-stretched <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> and laminar burning velocities of MF 20 and MF 50 are between those of MF and isooctane under all conditions. The peak un-stretched <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> of the blends occur in an equivalence ratio range of 1. 1 – 1. 2 at all temperatures, closer to the case of MF at higher temperatures. Both blended fuels have Markstein lengths closer to isooctane at an equivalence ratio lower than 1. 2 at all temperatures.

Studies at high strain rates are important in quantifying and understanding the response of vigorously burning flames and determine extinction states. Studies of weakly strained flames can be of particular interest for all stoichiometries. For example, the laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speeds,</b> S(sup o) (sub u), can be accurately determined by using the counterflow technique only if measurements are obtained at very low strain rates. Furthermore, near-limit flames are stabilized by weak strain rates. Previous studies have shown that near-limit flames are particularly sensitive to chain mechanisms, thermal radiation, and unsteadiness. The stabilization and study of weakly strained flames is complicated by the presence of buoyancy that can render the flames unstable to the point of extinction.

In our past studies the laminar <b>flame</b> <b>speeds</b> and extinction strain rates were directly measured at ultra-low strain rates.
