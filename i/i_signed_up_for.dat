Calling it an [...] "impressive debut issue", Jakala predicted that its high quality content and high value for the price would result in the anthology becoming a successful anthology in North America. In succeeding reviews, Jakala stated that Shonen Jump put [...] "American comics to shame", particularly in terms of the size {{of the magazine}} for the price versus the normal size of a similarly priced issue of a regular comic book. He did, however, note that the episodic nature of some of the series included had started to become repetitive after three issues, and that while the articles might appeal to many readers, he himself skipped over them. In addition to praising the value for the dollar, Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux felt that each of the chapters included were [...] "a self-sustaining and satisfying tale with a beginning, middle, and end" [...] that, coupled with the character and story summaries included for each series, made it easy for readers to keep up with a series even if they missed an issue.

5000|$|This is {{the story}} for the male {{character}}; the story for the female character differs only slightly. Returning Home; Well, we're going to dock with the main transfer station {{in about an hour}} now, and I won't have a chance to record anything until well after the shuttle drops us back planetside, so I've got to recount the last ten-day's events now.I'll tell you, seeing Inuktha on my screen was really something else, I mean, I never thought that one picture could mean that much to me. After having hitchhiked the length and breadth of the Galaxy for the past few years, it's really good to be home, I'll just say that. After having been in more tight spots than I'd care to recount, and having practically no real job skills, I've realized that I can either take the boring job my Uncle Karlan offered me in his importing business, or <b>I</b> could <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the Hyperball Races. I don't want to be stuck behind a desk the rest of my life, so just as soon as I get dropped planetside, I'm heading straight over to the Hyperball Racer's Association Office and <b>signing</b> <b>up.</b> My mothers don't want me to, they say it's too dangerous. They keep bringing up poor Cassandra, but now I think I'm ready to take on Calec. If I can, then I've got to. He's stepped on me a few too many times for me to forget.Calec <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> {{as soon as he got}} out of school. I remember him bragging to all the fems back home about how he'd win all the races. It seems, from what I've heard, that he's been doing just that. Of course, he wouldn't have the slightest problem with cheating to get there, the miserable cur. I remember when he took my old sweethearts, Lirani and Janica, from me, and I found out not a ten-day later that they'd found him with three other fem-pairs. He's hurt too many people, and he doesn't deserve to win any more.Personally, I still think he had something to do with Cassandra... She used to be very pretty, even for a Human, until her accident. Now she's almost as cruel as Calec. You know, I heard Calec spread so many rumors that I wasn't coming back, I'm sure he believes them himself. Won't he be surprised to see me walk up on the first day of the Races? Ah, we're docking now; it's time for me to collect my stuff and head over to the Transfer Depot. I'm back, Calec, and it's time for payback! ...|$|R
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment <b>I</b> tried to <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|R
