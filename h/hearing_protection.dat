5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear <b>hearing</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Workers {{may want}} to wear their hearing aids under an earmuff. According to OSHA, hearing aids {{should not be used}} in areas with {{dangerous}} noise levels. However, OSHA allows for the professional(s) in charge of the <b>hearing</b> loss <b>protection</b> program to decide on a case-by-case basis if a worker can wear their hearing aids under an earmuff in high-level noise environments. However, workers are not permitted to wear their hearing aids (even if they are turned off) instead of using HPD. OSHA specifies that hearing aids are not [...] "hearing protectors" [...] and do not attenuate enough sound to be used instead of HPD.|$|R
25|$|The {{compression}} effect: The amplification {{needed to}} make quiet sounds audible, if applied to loud sounds would damage the inner ear (cochlea). Louder sounds are therefore reduced giving a smaller audible volume range and hence inherent distortion. <b>Hearing</b> <b>protection</b> is also provided by an overall cap to the sound pressure. Also of protective value is impulse noise suppression, available in some high-end aids.|$|E

Currently, ACMS includes a soldier computer subsystem, which features a wearable computer and power pack, a communications subsystem supporting wireless radio and data connectivity through mesh networking, full color OLED based helmet mounted display and active noise diction <b>hearing</b> <b>protection,</b> indoor and outdoor navigation system with GPS support, and weapon-mounted camera with an ITL MARS reflex sight.|$|E
25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers {{have to work hard}} in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the back-pressure of the exhaust valve, to ensure that there is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face anything he wants to see. For this reason the faceplate is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{recently}} that people can use visual feedback about the current gaze direction of a second searcher to effectively partition the search space (Zelinsky et al., VSS abstract 2005, p. 193). We investigated whether a partitioning of space during dual visual search can occur without explicit feedback and verbal communication. Pairs of participants were seated side-by-side and searched for a target letter (“T”) among a set of distractor letters (“L”), projected on a large projection screen (2. 20 x 1. 80 m), indicating target present or absent on their individual keyboard. The instructions were varied: In experiment 1 (N= 20) neither collaboration nor competition was emphasized (neutral instruction condition, NIC). In experiment 2, participants (N= 22) were instructed to collaborate {{in order to obtain}} an announced gratification for the best group performance (collaborative instruction condition, CIC). In both experiments participants wore <b>hearing</b> <b>protections</b> and communication was prohibited. In NIC, participants responded fastest when the target appeared at {{the opposite side of the}} screen's center. In CIC, however, reaction times were faster when target letters were presented on the same side of the participant, resulting in a linear relationship between horizontal target eccentricity and the prevalence of the faster response at a particular seating side. We conclude that attention became spatially biased in horizontal direction during dual visual search, as a result of the physical juxtaposition of the participants. These findings can be interpreted as evidence for an implicit spatial partitioning of search space which can occur even without explicit feedback and verbal communication...|$|R

40|$|The burgeoning {{field of}} epigenetics is {{beginning}} to make {{a significant impact on}} our understanding of tissue development, maintenance, and function. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate the structure and activity of the genome in response to intracellular and environmental cues that direct cell-type specific gene networks. The inner ear is comprised of highly specialized cell types with identical genomes that originate from a single totipotent zygote. During inner ear development specific combinations of transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers must function in a coordinated manner to establish and maintain cellular identity. These epigenetic regulatory mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of distinct chromatin states and cell-type specific gene expression patterns. In this review, we highlight emerging paradigms for epigenetic modifications related to inner ear development, and how epigenetics may have a significant role in <b>hearing</b> loss, <b>protection,</b> and regeneration...|$|R

2500|$|Ultrasonic welding machines, {{like most}} {{industrial}} equipment, pose {{the risk of}} some hazards. [...] These include exposure to high heat levels and voltages.

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. <b>Hearing</b> <b>protection</b> devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> device (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E

For example, workers cannot be exposed to a sound level of 95 dB for more than 4 hours per day, or to sounds at 100 dB for more than 2 hours per day.

5000|$|The {{investigation}} of bogus marriages was, {{especially during the}} 1980s and 1990s, a bread-and-butter activity for Immigration Service enforcement. There were occasional operations to stop marriages at Registry Offices where firm intelligence suggested a fraud {{but the majority of}} this work was conducted at residential addresses at the behest of IND caseworkers who referred applications for further checks. Immigration Officers would visit the marital address and assess whether there was evidence that the marriage was genuine and subsisting and not a [...] "marriage of convenience". Officers would assess the domestic setting and draw obvious conclusions where there was only evidence of one person living there. That might conclude matters but, in cases of doubt, the couple would be interviewed in detail and asked questions regarding their domestic life together and the history of their relationship. Some marriage visits did not fall into this category and were altogether sadder. It was common for immigration offices to receive letters, particularly from young Anglo-Asian women, asking for help to prevent a forced marriage. The ability of immigration officers to provide help in these scenarios was fatally limited by the fear the women had of the consequences of presenting evidence in a public immigration appeals <b>hearing.</b> Some <b>protection</b> was eventually provided by the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007.|$|R

5000|$|Motivational {{techniques}} {{can be implemented}} to promote hearing conservation program compliance {{and the use of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>protection.</b> One suggestion is continued education at the workers' audiometric screening. They should be asked to bring along their current <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> device to the screening. If the results are normal and the inspection of the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> device is good, praise can be given for following protocol. If there is a shift in their hearing, instruction can be given again about the proper use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> and the importance of wearing them. Audiograms can be very useful in showing workers how noise can affect their hearing. One specific {{way to do this is}} to perform two hearing test on an employee on two different days. [...] One day the hearing test will be after wearing <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> all day and the other will be after not wearing <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> for the day. The difference can then be discussed with the worker and he/she has a tangible way to see how noise affects hearing. Another technique is using [...] "internal triggers" [...] to motivate employees to comply to the hearing conservation program. [...] If the individual already suffers from tinnitus and/or hearing loss they are probably more likely to use <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> because he/she does not want that problem to progress with noise exposure. Finally, the <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> offered should be comfortable so the worker will wear it. It is suggested that workers have a variety of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> devices available to them, including at least one type of earmuff and two different forms of earplugs, to fit the individual needs and wants of the workers.|$|E
50|$|PPE for <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> {{consists}} of earplugs and earmuffs. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> by the employers, {{as they are}} a low-cost intervention.|$|E

The Sixth Circuit and the Federal Circuit apply strict scrutiny while the Third, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits apply intermediate scrutiny.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the relationship between property rights on business methods and computer implemented inventions on the one hand, and the social and economic effects of such on the other hand. Although the rationales for IPR regimes (i. e. why we have them) have been greatly discussed, the existing socio-legal or economic literature on IPRs has largely ignored the dynamic effects (economic or social) of the exploitation of IPRs on the general profile of corporate power, or the accountability of that power. First when we understand this relationship, we will be able to design the most appropriate intellectual property right regime in relation to such ideas. The European Union (EU) ’s <b>hearing</b> on IPR <b>protection</b> of business methods and computer implemented inventions has been overshadowed by defining alternative classifications of business methods for patent protection. This paper argues we should instead focus on the nature and form of such legislation. It is here the challenge for IPR policy resides, and such discussion has been largely ignored.

50|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing <b>hearing</b> <b>protection</b> equipment did reduce overall hearing loss.|$|E
