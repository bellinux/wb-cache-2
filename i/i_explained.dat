500|$|Following Jackson's {{death in}} June 2009, {{there were reports}} that Jackson had left the Beatles {{catalogue}} to McCartney in his will, having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.) However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs. Upon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. [...] "Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately." [...] Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. [...] "His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts." ...|$|E

Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera".

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} race, Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods, {{collapsed}} and lost consciousness. [...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president Nelson said [...] "I feel bad. Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way anyone wants to take away the win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> I did not see the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E

He recalled to Stasov, [...] "Because I am not a theorist, I could not teach him harmony (as, for instance Rimsky-Korsakov now teaches it) ... <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to him the form of compositions, and to do this we played through both Beethoven symphonies [...] and much else (Schumann, Schubert, Glinka, and others), analyzing the form."
