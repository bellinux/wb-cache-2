5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and <b>hoeing,</b> preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E

40|$|In family {{agriculture}} in the Brazilian Northeast, {{it is a common}} practice to plant corn seeds harvested during previous cultivations. Because weed control in those properties does not get appropriate attention, it is possible that weeds interfere with seed quality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of weed control on germination, vigor (plantlet, first count and dry matter data), dimensions, and weight of corn seeds. Two experiments were carried out as a random block design with split-plots, and five replicates, either with six (AG 405 C, DKB 425, EX 6005, AG 2060, BA 8517, and BA 9513) or four (BA 9012, BA 8512, EX 4001, and EX 6004) cultivars, respectively. In both, cultivars were assigned to plots and weed control to subplots. In the first experiment, weed control was achieved by means of two <b>hoeings.</b> In the second, control was accomplished by two <b>hoeings</b> or by intercropping with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.). In both experiments, it was verified that weeds did not have an influence on germination percentage or on first count data (except for one cultivar); however, plantlet dry matter weight was higher in hand hoed plots. In those plots, width, height, and seed weight were also higher. In both experiments, the cultivars were not different in relation to germination percentage. In the first experiment, the cultivars were different with respect to first count data, while in the second experiment they were different with regard to first count and plantlet dry matter data...|$|R

25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the annual flood rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of <b>hoeing,</b> some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two <b>hoeing</b> and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E

This study aims at evaluating growth, green ear yield, and grain yield in corn when in competition with weeds. Cultivars AG 1051 and BRS 106 were grown with (two <b>hoeings,</b> at 20 and 40 days after sowing) or without weed control. In order to evaluate crop growth, six collections of the above-ground part and the root system of corn were performed, every 15 days, with the first collection made 30 days after sowing. A randomized complete block design was adopted, with split-split plots (weed control in plots, cultivars in subplots, and collections in sub-subplots) and ten replicates. Eighteen weed species were found in the experiment area. Increased values of corn leaf area, above-ground part and root system, due to plant age function, were smaller in non-hoed plots than in hoed plots and were dependent upon cultivar. The lack of weed control increased dry matter of weeds aboveground part and decreased green ear yield and grain yield. Cultivar AG 1051 had higher increases in leaf area, above-ground part of the plant and root system, due to plant age function, and controlled weeds better than cultivar BRS 106. In addition, cultivar AG 1051 was superior to other cultivars with respect to most traits used for green corn yield and grain yield assessment...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the beneficial influence of nitrogen doses on corn dry grain yield and green ear yield. Due to a growing concern with environmental degradation, many agricultural practices, adopted in the past, are being reexamined. With regard to weed control, strategies that employ mechanical control, including intercrops, are being the object of renewed interest. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of the application of nitrogen doses (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha- 1; as ammonium sulfate) and weed control on the growth, green ear yield, and grain yield of the AG 1051 corn cultivar. A randomized block experimental design with split-plots and nine replications was adopted. In addition to nitrogen rates, the AG 1051 cultivar was submitted to the following treatments, applied to subplots: no weeding, two <b>hoeings</b> (at 20 and 40 days after sowing), and intercropping with gliricídia (Gliricidia sepium). Gliricidia was sowed at corn planting, between the corn rows, using two seedlings per pit, in pits spaced 0. 30 m apart. Gliricidia did not provide weed control, and gave plant growth, green ear yield and grain yield values similar to the no weeding treatment. However, regarding the number of mature ears got, intercropping with gliricidia did not differ from the two-hoeing treatment. Weed control did not have an effect on plant height and number of marketable, husked green ears, with the application of 120 kg N ha- 1; indicating that nitrogen improved the corn's competitive ability. The two-hoeing treatment provided the best means for total green ears weight, number of marketable husked ears, both unhusked and husked marketable ear weight, grain yield and its components than the other treatments. Nitrogen application increased corn growth, green ear yield, and grain yield, as well as weed green biomass, but reduced the stand and growth of gliricidia...|$|R

Nevertheless, interaction between weeds and insects may exist. This study aimed to evaluate green ear and corn grain yield response to weed and fall armyworm control. A completely randomized block design with split-plots and five replicates was adopted. Corn cultivar AG 1051 was grown under weedy conditions or with control by hand <b>hoeings</b> performed at 20 and 40 days after planting. Fall armyworm control (applied to subplots) was performed with sprays of water (control), deltamethrin (5 g active ingredient ha- 1); neem oil, at 0. 5 % (diluted in water), and neem leaf extract at 5 %.

A interferência imposta pelas plantas daninhas ao milho reduz praticamente todas as características vegetativas. Em conseqüência, os rendimentos de espigas verdes e degrãos são reduzidos. Perdas devidas ao ataque da lagarta-do-cartucho (Spodoptera frugiperda) podem reduzir o rendimento de grãos em até 34 %. Em geral, os efeitos dos controles das plantas daninhas e das pragas são estudados separadamente. Apesar disso a interação entre interferência de plantas daninhas e ataque de pragas pode existir. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os rendimentos de espigas verdes e de grãos de milho em resposta ao controle das plantas daninhas e da lagarta-do-cartucho. Utilizou-se o delineamento de blocos completos casualizados com parcelas subdivididas e cinco repetições. O milho cultivar AG 1051 foi cultivado no mato ou com controle de plantas daninhas por capinas manuais aplicadas aos 20 e 40 dias após a semeadura. Para avaliar o controle do inseto (aplicado às subparcelas) foram feitas pulverizações com: água (testemunha); deltamethrin (5 g do ingrediente ativo ha- 1); óleo de nim, obtido comercialmente, à base de 0, 5 % (com diluição em água); e extrato foliar de nim, a 5 %.
