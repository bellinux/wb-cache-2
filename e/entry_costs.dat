5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the earthquakes, the National Crisis Management Centre was activated through The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to manage public response to the disaster; hundreds of police officers were accordingly dispatched to patrol the city streets. Authorities proposed to set up an outdoors emergency operations centre, as well as a public welfare centre to provide shelter to victims overnight. The Student Volunteer Army — which partook in silt shifting after the February 2011 quake — again prepared the recruitment of participants to initiate street clearing actions. A total of NZ$285,000 (US$230,000) was allocated for donations to nine charities, including NZ$40,000 (US$32,000) to both the Red Cross Christchurch earthquake appeal and the Canterbury Earthquake Appeal Salvation Army funds. At Westpac Bank, a public donation account was opened in order to provide financial assistance for earthquake victims. Chief executives from the Commonwealth Bank sponsored an exclusive dinner in Sydney to raise money for rebuilding costs; an initial A$700,000 (US$660,000) was allocated prior to the event, with <b>entry</b> <b>costs</b> of A$10,000 (US$9,500) per ticket.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from <b>entry</b> <b>costs</b> but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

40|$|A {{monopoly}} facing potential entry may {{not want}} to develop an efficient technology even at zero R&D costs. Such a phenomenon occurs if a new technology is distinct from the existing one so production uncertainty becomes technology-specific. Then the monopoly can reduce the entrant's post-entry profit to the point of deterrence by using the existing technology with which the entrant would enter. We show that the monopoly develops a new technology when the entrant faces a sufficiently high or low <b>entry</b> <b>cost</b> but forgoes invention when the <b>entry</b> <b>cost</b> is intermediate.

40|$|In {{this study}} we adopt a general {{equilibrium}} model with occupational choice and incomplete contract enforcement in order to evaluate the effects of policies {{to reduce the size}} of the informal economy. More concretely, we try to quantify the effects of tax, <b>entry</b> <b>cost,</b> and contract enforcement on output, income distribution, and tax revenue. The model is specifically calibrated to the Korean economy. Under the assumption of an endogenously determined interest rate, the effects of policies on total output are restrictive. However, the demand effect shows that <b>entry</b> <b>cost</b> and contract enforcement have significant potential influences on output. Lowering the tax rate increases income inequality in spite of the shrinkage in size of the informal sector. There is no Laffer curve effect when the tax rate is lowered, despite the broadened tax base. Lowering the <b>entry</b> <b>cost</b> turns out to be a viable policy option for reducing the size of the informal sector, as it reduces inequality and increases tax revenue effectively.

500|$|Irons {{proposed}} that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These [...] "ostentatious" [...] displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members. Sosis demonstrated {{that people in}} religious communities are {{four times more likely}} to live longer than their secular counterparts, and that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly requirements demanded from religious community members. However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the <b>entry</b> <b>costs</b> imposed.|$|E
