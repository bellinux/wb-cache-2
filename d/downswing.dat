25|$|The {{bowling ball}} speed is {{affected}} primarily by three factors: gravitational forces, forward momentum, and <b>downswing</b> acceleration. The {{speed of the}} ball as generated by gravitational forces during the swing depends primarily on the total arc of the swing. This arc is further affected by {{the length of the}} bowler’s arm and by the height at which the swing begins. Assuming a longer arm and higher swing peak will maximize the speed that the gravitational forces produce. Forward momentum is manifested in the walking approach of the bowler prior to the throw. The “four-step” approach is most commonly applied, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left at starting position (for right handed bowlers). Longer legs and a faster approach during the third step and <b>downswing</b> will increase the ball speed. Finally, the deliberate acceleration of the arm during <b>downswing</b> is of critical focus. This particular factor is difficult to master, however, because one can easily force the armswing and thus accelerate too quickly or cause the arm to deviate from the natural path.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Hogan advocates {{the use of}} a waggle {{not only}} because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to {{remember}} where to go for the first part of your backswing. The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass. [...] The [...] "glass" [...] has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the <b>downswing.</b> [...] At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.|$|E
2500|$|A proper stance {{starts with}} your feet being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. [...] As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. [...] Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. [...] Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. [...] The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the <b>downswing.</b> [...] Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E

Our unique approach is to combine an established method relying on daily prices with institutional features of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It enables us to separate individuals from institutions by examining two trading mechanisms with different investor structures. The empirical results suggest that individuals engage in herding during market <b>downswings,</b> while there is less evidence of imitating trading behaviour in bullish markets. Regardless {{of the state of the}} market, institutions' trading behaviour does not appear to exhibit herd behaviour. Further evidence suggests that herding by individuals becomes less pronounced over time. Herding Behavioural finance Market microstructure Polish stock market...|$|R

Furthermore and in line with Hypothesis 7, employees who leave a firm providing further training face a comparatively low risk of unemployment and are exposed to less lateral mobility or decline. Evidently, employees working in such a firm profit from the increase in their productivity gained from the further training they have received (Büchel and Pannenberg 2004; Dieckhoff 2007) and from the positive signals ascribed to them (Backes-Gellner and Tuor 2010; Tirole 1996).|$|R

50|$|Shaft flex {{has a very}} {{pronounced}} effect on the power and accuracy of a wood. Every wood {{is somewhere in between}} the two extremes of flex, from the extra whippy, to the extra stiff. Whippy shafts are used by those who have low swing speeds and stiff by those who have faster swing speeds. The flex of a shaft allows it to store energy from a player's <b>downswing,</b> and release it as the head makes contact for increased club speed at impact. A shaft that is too stiff cannot be flexed by the golfer during their <b>downswing,</b> which reduces club speed at impact. A shaft that is too whippy will retain some of its stored flex at contact, wasting energy.|$|E
