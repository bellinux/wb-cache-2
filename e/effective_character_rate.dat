40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an <b>effective</b> <b>character</b> extraction algorithm {{that can}} be used for optical character recognition (OCR). Using both geometrical and colour information, the character extraction algorithm can extract text from colour document images which contain mixed text and pictures. The algorithm consists of three components, i. e., adaptive k-means clustering, binary morphological processing, and shape and space-related refinement. When the algorithm is used as a plug-in pre-processing stage for an OCR system, the performance of the system can be improved. Character recognition experiment was done with a commercial OCR package. It has been shown that our algorithm can improve <b>character</b> recognition <b>rate</b> on complex document from 73. 1 % to 95. 5 % on average...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{if there is}} a difference in viewer perception of computer animated character facial expressions based on character body style, specifically, realistic and stylized character body styles. Participants viewed twenty clips of computer animated characters expressing one of five emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, surprise and fear. They then named the emotion and rated the sincerity, intensity, and typicality of each clip. The results indicated that for recognition, participants were more slightly more likely to recognize a stylized character although it was not a significant difference. Stylized characters were on average rated higher for sincerity and intensity and realistic characters were on average rated higher for typicality. A significant difference in ratings was shown with fear (within sincerity and typicality) having realistic <b>characters</b> <b>rated</b> higher, happiness (within sincerity and intensity) having stylized <b>characters</b> <b>rated</b> higher and stylized being rated higher once for anger (stylized) and realistic (typicality) being rated once for anger.

We provide a statistical analysis showing that if, for example, the expected <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> is around 1 %, then with a test set of at least 10; 000 statistically independent handwritten characters (which could be obtained by taking 100 characters from each of 100 different writers), we guarantee, with 95 % confidence, that: (1) the expected value of the <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> is not worse than 1 : 25 E, where E is the empirical <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> of the best recognizer, calculated on the test set; and (2) a difference of 0 : 3 E between the error rates of two recognizers is significant.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{years have}} seen a growing {{interest}} in creating virtual agents to populate the cast of characters for interactive narrative. A key challenge posed by interactive characters for narrative environments is devising expressive dialogue generators. To be <b>effective,</b> <b>character</b> dialogue generators {{must be able to}} simultaneously take into account multiple sources of information that bear on dialogue, including character attributes, plot development, and communicative goals. Building on the narrative theory of character archetypes, we propose an archetype-driven character dialogue generator that uses a probabilistic unification framework to generate dialogue motivated by character personality and narrative history to achieve communicative goals.
