Minor archaeological excavations {{were conducted in}} the 19th century. In 1905 Mexican archaeologist and government official, in the regime of Porfirio Díaz, Leopoldo Batres led a major project of excavation and restoration. The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of the Mexican War of Independence in 1910. The site of Teotihuacan {{was the first to}} be expropriated for the national patrimony under the Law of Monuments (1897), giving jurisdiction under legislation for the Mexican state to take control. Some 250 plots were farmed on the site. Peasants who had been farming portions were ordered to leave and the Mexican government eventually paid some compensation to those individuals. A <b>feeder</b> <b>train</b> line was built to the site in 1908, which allowed the efficient hauling of material from the excavations and later to bring tourists to the site. In 1910, the International Congress of Americanists met in Mexico, coinciding with the centennial celebrations, and the distinguished delegates, such as its president Eduard Seler and vice president Franz Boas were taken to the newly finished excavations.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of delay management is whether trains should wait for delayed <b>feeder</b> <b>trains</b> or should depart on time.

Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm in which we first solve the delay management model with a fixed platform assignment and then improve this platform assignment in each step. We show that the latter problem can be solved in polynomial time by presenting a totally unimodular IP formulation.

Primary initial delays of trains may cause a whole cascade of secondary delays of other trains over the entire network. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for delay propagation and forecasts of arrival and departure events which is applicable to all kind of public transport (not only to railway traffic). Our model is fairly realistic, it includes general waiting policies (how long do trains wait for delayed <b>feeder</b> <b>trains),</b> it uses driving time profiles (discrete distributions) on travel arcs which depend on the departure time, and it incorporates the catch-up potential of buffer times on driving sections and train stops. The model is suited for an online scenario where a massive stream of update messages on {{the current status of}} trains arrives which has to be propagated through the whole network. Efficient stochastic propagation of delays has important applications in online timetable information, in delay management and train disposition, and in stability analysis of timetables.

These models have approximately 50  %, 25  % and 25  % respectively of the tonne‐kilometres in Europe. ‘Trainload’ refers to dedicated trains operating {{for a specific}} company, or cargo type, e.g. ore, coal and timber trains. ‘Wagonload’ refers to conventional SWL (Single Wagon Load) from customers, transported by a feeder rail freight operator to a nearest or suitable marshalling yard or terminal for consolidation, from where they are transported by long distance block or shuttle trains to the destination terminal or marshalling yard, {{and then on to}} destination by <b>feeder</b> <b>train</b> transport. ‘Intermodal traffic’ refers to cargo in containers, swap‐bodies and trailers used for feeder transport, that are loaded on trains at terminals for long‐distance transportation. SWL volume has gradually decreased in favour of trainload and intermodal [7, 18, 39]. In contrast, the freight volume carried by intermodal train has increased, mainly due to the higher flow of containers through maritime ports.|$|E

However, for large-scale real-world instances, these extended models become too large to be solved with standard integer programming techniques. We therefore develop several heuristics to tackle these larger instances. The dispatching rules that are used in practice are our first heuristic. Our second heuristic applies the classical delay management model without passenger rerouting. Finally, the third heuristic updates the parameters of the classical model iteratively. We compare the quality of these heuristic solution methods on real-life instances from Netherlands Railways. In this experimental study, we show that our iterative heuristic can solve large real-world instances within a short computation time. Furthermore, the solutions obtained by this iterative heuristic are of good quality. public transportation;daily management;passenger rerouting;railway operations...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{robustness}} of timetables for {{a network of}} passenger train services, this paper seeks to minimize a waiting cost function that includes running time supplements and different types of waiting times and late arrivals. The approach {{is applied to the}} whole intercity (IC) network of the Belgian railways. The IC network consists of 14 fast trains connecting all major cities in Belgium. In {{the first phase of the}} approach, ideal running time supplements are calculated to safeguard connections when the <b>feeder</b> <b>train</b> is late. These supplements are based on the delay distributions of the trains, the passenger counts and on the weighting of different types of waiting times. In a second phase, continuous Linear Programming (LP) is used to construct an improved timetable with well-scheduled connections and, whenever possible, with ideal running time supplements. Simulation evaluates different timetables and makes further improvement of the LP timetable possible. For the case of the IC network, the final result is a timetable with suitable transfer times and a waiting cost, that is, 40 % lower than the current timetable. Since continuous LP modelling is applied, the proposed technique is very promising for developing better timetables - even for very extensive railway networks. ...|$|E

A catch-and-release experimental design was applied in which <b>feeder</b> <b>trained</b> bees were caught when arriving at the feeder, treated with one of the neonicotinoids, and released 1. 5 hours later at a remote site. The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar.

The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory.

In the world of grandmother Noemi, “things are made of put together utterances”, and her granddaughter makes the effort to catch the meaning hidden in them, subtly interwoven in grandmother’s life hour after hour, gesture by gesture.

In Jana Šrámková’s text the things, even the very trivial ones, were not made into bare details, they are not just a background for such constructions as action or character. They were interwoven into the semantic relations revealing other levels of meaning. They are the things-symbols, things-metaphors, things-allegories.

40|$|Process {{operators}} {{at large}} railway stations have the difficult task {{to secure a}} fluent train traffic flow while minimizing deviations from established timetables. Variation in actual train departure times is inevitable due to many circumstances such as arrival delays and fluctuations in alighting and boarding time, even if some buffer time is contained in the dwell time. Moreover, a departure may be delayed by waiting for a <b>feeder</b> <b>train</b> to secure a connection and by conflicting train movements prohibiting an outbound train path. The predictability of train processes is even more degraded when in similar situations different control actions are pursued depending on for instance individual dispatchers. In the Netherlands, passenger train services operate basically according to a cyclic timetable, repeating the same arrival and departure times each hour, {{with the exception of}} additional passenger trains in rush hours and freight trains that are scheduled in between the regular train services. It is hence anticipated that the traffic processes are mainly variations on a repetitious pattern. Analysis of historical realization data then yields operational insight {{that can be used to}} improve or support process management. To gain accurate operations data a software tool, TNV-Prepare, has been developed that filters relevant train detection data from train describer records. This paper starts with a brief account of the collection and preparation of train detection data. Then for the particular case of station Eindhoven a detailed punctuality analysis is reported including the performance of dwell and transfer times (tightness or possible recovery time) and train waiting times to secure connections. Departure delays are predicted from arrival delays using regression analysis, whereas the remaining noise is attributed to human factors. Transport and PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

When {{in particular}} experimental paradigms {{the two types}} of information – vector-based and landmark-based information – are made to compete with each other, the insect may weight either source more heavily depending on the navigational context and the animal's motivational state. Here we studied the effects of a displaced nest mark on the homing performances of Cataglyphis ants. Foragers were trained to shuttle between the nest, which was marked by a black cylinder (the beacon), and an artificial <b>feeder.</b> <b>Trained</b> ants were captured at the feeder and transferred to a distant test field, where they experienced the nest mark at various positions relative to their home vector. When the beacon was positioned {{to one side of the}} point of release, the ants slightly drifted towards the beacon right at the start of their inbound run, but thereafter resumed their home-vector courses. When the nest mark appeared to one side further down the homing course, the ants set off in the home-vector direction, but then gradually drifted towards the beacon. The distance, at which this occurred, and the ants' drift from the home-vector course were very similar across test conditions. During the final search for the nest, landmark information dominated the ants' path integrator. The results clearly show that nest-mark memories are effective during the entire vector-based homeward course, but that they are either only partly activated or partly used unless the state of the ants' path integrator is close to zero...|$|R

40|$|Reliability of {{transfers}} in {{a transportation}} network largely influences {{the level of}} service of trip chains. Especially in low-frequency service networks like (long-distance) railway networks. Running and dwell times are typically subject to random variations resulting in arrival delays during operation. If a scheduled transfer connection is endangered, process operators can decide to secure the tansfer by holding the connecting train until the passengers of the delayed <b>feeder</b> <b>train(s)</b> have arrived. However, a large departure delay may result in severe delay propagation. The effect of dispatching is thus very complex {{and can not be}} foreseen without advanced mathematical models. This paper proposes a mathematical model for computing optimal train waiting times depending on the actual state of delays in the train service network. The optimal strategy determines the transfers that must be secured or cancelled with respect to estimated arrival delays. Several objectives may be pursued, including the minimization of total delay or the minimization of weighted passenger waiting time. The incorporated delay propagation model explores the compensating effect of recovery times to arrival delays and is modelled as a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS), and in particular as a max-plus linear system. The optimal train waiting time strategies can be computed offline for each scenario of arrival delays. The optimal strategies result in critical passage times at reference points about 10 minutes before the railway stations. If the actual passage time exceeds the relevant critical passage time then the associated connection at the railway station is cancelled. The results can be incorporated in a decision support system to assist process operators at railway stations or traffic operators at traffic control centra.

40|$|Frequent train delays make passenger-oriented train {{dispatching}} a task of high practical relevance. In case of delays, dispatchers have {{to decide}} whether trains should wait for one or several delayed <b>feeder</b> <b>trains</b> or should depart on time. To support dispatchers, we have recently introduced the train dispatching framework PANDA (CASPT 2015). In this paper, we present and evaluate two enhancements which are also of general interest. First, we study the sensitivity of waiting decisions with respect to the accuracy of passenger flow data. More specifically, we develop an integer linear programming formulation for the following optimization problem: Given a critical transfer, what is the minimum number of passengers we have to add or to subtract from the given passenger flow such that the decision would change from waiting to non-waiting or vice versa? Based on experiments with realistic passenger flows and delay data from 2015 in Germany, an important empirical finding is that a significant fraction of all decisions is highly sensitive to small changes in passenger flow composition. Hence, very accurate passenger flows are needed in these cases. Second, we investigate the practical value of more sophisticated simulations. A simple strategy evaluates the effect of a waiting decision of some critical transfer on passenger delay subject to the assumption that all subsequent decisions are taken according to standard waiting time rules, as usually employed by railway companies like Deutsche Bahn. Here we analyze the impact of a higher level of simulation where waiting decisions for a critical transfer are considered jointly with one or more other decisions for subsequent transfers. We learn that such "coupled decisions" lead to improved solution in about 6. 3 % of all considered cases...|$|R
