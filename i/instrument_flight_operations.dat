The increased speed of aircraft and higher air traffic density made it harder to give pilots enough time to spot each other during flights. [...] Therefore, the CAB said, [...] "it is essential that positive control be extended to altitudes at 35,000feet and on additional routes as rapidly as practical."

50|$|The runway has {{a length}} of 3,000 m and a width of 45 m. The {{approaches}} to {{both ends of the}} runway are categorized for <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> in precision category I.|$|E
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} reaches {{from the}} surface to 4,000 ft. AGL above the airport which it surrounds. Class C airspace only exists over airports which have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have {{a certain number of}} <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b> Class C is also individually designed for airports but usually covers a surface area of about 5 nautical miles around the airport up to 1,200 ft AGL. At 1,200 ft. the airspace extends to 10 nautical miles in diameter which continues to 4,000 ft. Pilots are required to establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic control service to the area before entering the airspace. Within Class C, Visual and Instrument pilots are separated.|$|E
50|$|On July 26, 1979 {{at about}} 9:43 pm a Cessna 320A (tail number N3005R) crashed during its final {{approach}} to Monterey. The 62-year-old pilot used improper <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rules <b>operations.</b> The pilot had about 3,621 flight hours.|$|R

50|$|Certified for single-pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules (IFR) <b>operation,</b> the HH-65A was {{the first}} {{helicopter}} certified with a four-axis autopilot, allowing for hands-off hover over a pre-determined location.|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} usable IFR {{infrastructure}} and radar coverage combined with the harsh weather conditions caused Alaska {{to have a high}} rate of CFIT accidents. Pilots, departing for VFR-only destinations with the intention of maintaining visual separation with terrain or water, continued flying toward their destination after encountering marginal weather conditions which would normally involve <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b> The terrain-awareness function of the Capstone avionics provided ground-proximity functionality. The terrain function showed terrain via an intuitive high-resolution color display using black, green, yellow and red to indicate the proximity of terrain to the aircraft. The avionics continuously monitored the aircraft's altitude, GPS-derived position, ground speed, route of flight, and compared this data to a built-in database of terrain elevation. The display automatically provided a terrain advisory to the pilot if the aircraft was within two minutes of a close encounter with the ground.|$|E

50|$|The Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) {{operates}} as a U.S. Air Force Field Operating Agency operating {{under the direction of}} the Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force. AFFSA maximizes the effectiveness of Air Force global air operations by ensuring access to worldwide airspace in all weather conditions. The agency does this by providing accurate, relevant, and timely flight information and support services to Department of Defense, national, and coalition aviators. It also acts as lead command for the creation and application of criteria, procedures, and precision equipment for worldwide <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations,</b> air traffic control, airfield management, and air traffic control and landing systems for the Air Force. AFFSA evaluates and capitalizes on emerging technologies to ensure unrestricted access to domestic and international airspace. It partners with Federal Aviation Administration, sister services, major commands, coalition partners, and host nations to maintain the consistency and accuracy of more than 81 airfields, 1,092 navigation systems and 8,214 instrument approach procedures worldwide. It performs combat flight inspections, oversees the Air Force airfield operations standardization program and instructs the Air Force Advanced Instrument School.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash, {{according}} to the NTSB, was improper IFR (<b>Instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules) <b>operation,</b> failure to adhere to instrument approach procedures. The airplane collided with a mountain on a missed approach to landing, after multiple missed approaches. The weather at the airport was below approach minima with a low ceiling and sea fog.|$|R

50|$|Approach plates (or, more formally, {{instrument}} approach procedure charts) are the printed charts of {{instrument approach}} procedures that pilots use to fly instrument approaches during <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules (IFR) <b>operations.</b> Each country maintains their own {{instrument approach procedure}}s according to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.|$|R
40|$|A fixed-base {{simulator}} {{study was conducted}} to define pilot workload and task performance associated with <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> for an intracity helicopter passenger service. Displays considered necessary to provide a minimal capability under Instrument Flight Rules conditions were used to fly a representative commercial helicopter route structure in the New York area, with each terminal assumed to be equipped with a precision approach guidance system. A cross section of pilots participated as test subjects, and despite the high workload level, the results indicated that for the assumptions employed, minimums of 61 m (200 ft) ceiling and 805 m (0. 5 mile) visibility were feasible...|$|E
40|$|Key {{problems}} in single pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> {{are in the}} management of flight data and the processing of cockpit information during conditions of heavy workload. A flight data console was developed to allow simulation of a digital data link to replace the current voice communications stem used in air traffic control. This is a human factors evaluation of a data link communications system to determine how such a system might reduce cockpit workload, improve flight proficiency, and be accepted by general aviation pilots. The need for a voice channel as backup to a digital link is examined. The evaluations cover both airport terminal area operations and full mission instrument flight. Results show that general aviation pilots operate well with a digital data link communications system. The findings indicate that a data link system for pilot/ATC communications, with a backup voice channel, is well accepted by general aviation pilots and is considered to be safer, more efficient, and result in less workload than the current voice system...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Ames Research Center's Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft to evaluate the influence of highly augmented control modes {{on the ability of}} pilots to execute precision <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> in the terminal area, particularly approaches to and landings on a short runway. The aircraft is a powered-lift, short-takeoff and landing configuration that is equipped with a modern digital fly-by-wire flight control system, a head-up display, and a solar head-down display that make it possible to investigate control concepts and display format and content for full envelope, powered-lift operations. Considerable attention has been devoted in this flight program to assessing flightpath and airspeed command and stabilization modes developed using nonlinear, inverse model-following methods.

50|$|Manufacturing {{began in}} 1975. The Model 222 first flew on August 13, 1976. It {{received}} certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on August 16, 1979 and was approved for {{visual flight rules}} (VFR) use on December 20, 1979. Helicopter deliveries began on January 16, 1980. The FAA approved the 222 for single-pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules (IFR) <b>operation</b> on May 15, 1980.|$|R
40|$|The pilot-machine {{interface}} with aircraft automation {{to increase the}} safety and utility of single-pilot IFR (<b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules) <b>operations</b> is addressed. An automatic terminal approach system (ATAS), that uses stored instrument approach data to automatically tune aircraft radios and control the aircraft autopilot, was conceived {{as a means of}} improving this critical interface. The ATAS automatically flies instrument approach procedures, including the missed approach, and provides for easy pilot interaction to accommodate air traffic control radar vectors and altitude assignments. A research prototype of an ATAS was developed to the extent necessary for a simulation implementation and piloted evaluation. The development of the ATAS concept and the software algorithms is described...|$|R
50|$|On January 15, {{heavy traffic}} {{to the airport}} forced the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control System Command Center to issue a ground stop for all {{aircraft}} trying to leave the U.S. for Haitian airspace due to limited space and lack of fuel at Haiti airport. Problems had been compounded by pilots inbound to the airport canceling <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules <b>operation</b> and proceeding on visual flight rules. That day the United States was formally granted temporary control of the airport per a memorandum of understanding signed by the Haitian Prime Minister. The airport has apparently been operating without radar, although the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson arrived {{the morning of the}} 15th and has advanced aircraft tracking capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Special use {{airspace}} includes: restricted airspace, prohibited airspace, {{military operations}} areas (MOA), warning areas, alert areas, temporary flight restriction (TFR), national security areas, and controlled firing areas, typically up to FL180 or 18,000 ft above sea level. In addition {{there is often}} an Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) from FL180 through FL600 in which ATC plans for military operations. ATCAAs are generally not depicted on charts because flights above FL180 are subject to mandatory <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules <b>operation</b> requiring continuous contact with ATC. Alert areas may contain high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. MOAs (located over land) and warning areas (located over domestic or international waters or both) and training routes contain high volumes of military activity.|$|R
40|$|A set {{of flight}} tests {{designed}} {{to evaluate the}} relative utility of candidate displays with advanced symbology for general aviation terminal area <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules <b>operations</b> are discussed. The symbology was previously evaluated {{as part of the}} NASA Langley Research Center's Terminal Configured Vehicle Program for use in commercial airlines. The advanced symbology included vehicle track angle, flight path angle and a perspective representation of the runway. These symbols were selectively drawn on a cathode ray tube (CRT) display along with the roll attitude, pitch attitude, localizer deviation and glideslope deviation. In addition to the CRT display, the instrument panel contained standard turn and bank, altimeter, rate of climb, airspeed, heading, and engine instruments. The symbology was evaluated using tracking performance and pilot subjective ratings for an instrument landing system capture and tracking task...|$|R
40|$|Flying qualities {{criteria}} for Single Pilot <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rule (SPIFR) <b>operations</b> were investigated. The ARA aircraft was modified and adapted for SPIFR operations. Aircraft configurations to be flight-tested were chosen and matched on the ARA in-flight simulator, implementing {{modern control theory}} algorithms. Mission planning and experimental matrix design were completed. Microprocessor software for the onboard data acquisition system was debugged and flight-tested. Flight-path reconstruction procedure and the associated FORTRAN program were developed. Algorithms associated with the statistical analysis of flight test results and the SPIFR flying qualities criteria deduction are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of Mexico {{airspace}} has {{two major}} operating regions: low altitude offshore (below 7, 000 ft) and high altitude oceanic (above 18, 000 ft). Both regions suffer significant inefficiencies {{due to the}} lack of continuous surveillance during <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rules <b>operations.</b> Provision of surveillance in the offshore region is hindered by its low-altitude nature, which makes coverage by conventional radars economically infeasible. Significant portions of the oceanic sectors are inaccessible to shore-based sensors, as they are beyond line-of-sight. Two emerging surveillance technologies were assessed that are relatively low cost and can be deployed on offshore platforms Wide Area Multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast. Performance criteria were formulated using existing FAA specifications. Three configurations were developed and deployed representative of systems serving full-size and reduced-sized domestic terminal areas and an en-route/oceanic region. These configurations were evaluated during nine flight test periods using fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{estimation}} {{and control}} theory, flight testing, and statistical analysis {{were used to}} deduce flying qualities criteria for General Aviation Single Pilot <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rule (SPIFR) <b>operations.</b> The principal concern is that unsatisfactory aircraft dynamic response combined with high navigation/communication workload can produce problems of safety and efficiency. To alleviate these problems, {{the relative importance of}} these factors must be determined. This objective was achieved by flying SPIFR tasks with different aircraft dynamic configurations and assessing the effects of such variations under these conditions. The experimental results yielded quantitative indicators of pilot's performance and workload, and for each of them, multivariate regression was applied to evaluate several candidate flying qualities criteria...|$|R
25|$|The EC135 can be {{equipped}} with either a conventional flight deck or the Avionique Novelle glass cockpit – the latter allows for single pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules <b>operation.</b> The glass cockpit is equipped with several liquid-crystal displays, including two Sextant SMD45 displays and a central panel display. The main avionics suite is supplied by Thales Group; the EC135 can be outfitted with various avionics suites from manufacturers such as Russian firm Transas Aviation and British firm Britannia 2000. The newer H135 model can {{be equipped}} with a four-axis autopilot, which is included {{as part of the}} Helionix avionics suite; this suite provides the H135 a greater level of commonality with several other Airbus Helicopters-produced rotorcraft including the H145, H160 and H175. Earlier versions of the EC135 were equipped with a three-axis autopilot with integrated stability augmentation; featuring a First Limit Indicator (FLI), simplifying engine and torque monitoring. Cockpit touch screens can be optionally installed.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that radio {{communications}} between pilots and air traffic control contribute to high pilot workload and are subject to various errors. These errors result from congestion on the voice radio channel, and missed and misunderstood messages. The use of digital data link has been proposed {{as a means of}} reducing this workload and error rate. A critical factor, however, in determining the potential benefit of data link will be the interface between future data link systems and the operator of those systems, both in the air and on the ground. The purpose of this effort was to evaluate the pilot interface with various levels of data link capability, in simulated general aviation, single-pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rule <b>operations.</b> Results show that the data link reduced demands on pilots' short-term memory, reduced the number of communication transmissions, and permitted the pilots to more easily allocate time to critical cockpit tasks while receiving air traffic control messages. The pilots who participated unanimously indicated a preference for data link communications over voice-only communications. There were, however, situations in which the pilot preferred the use of voice communications, and the ability for pilots to delay processing the data link messages, during high workload events, caused delays in the acknowledgement of messages to air traffic control...|$|R

40|$|A helical-approach {{concept is}} {{presented}} for <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rules (IFR) <b>operation</b> of rotorcraft into congested terminal areas where separation from high-speed jet traffic is highly desirable and the airport-precision-approach aid is a Microwave Landing System (MLS). The concept {{takes advantage of}} the fact that rotorcraft need not land on the main runway but can operate from a pad that lies on an MLS radial offset from the centerline. The results of 48 flights using a UH- 1 H helicopter and a research avionics system are presented. Three levels of navigation sophistication were also investigated. It is shown that an approach helix can be contained in a relatively small volume and that being within the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Category II window at a 30 -m (100 -ft) altitude is not a requirement for a successful hover over a landing pad. Only two of the three navigation systems provided estimates that allowed all flights to descend from hover to touchdown...|$|R
50|$|Under ATC Zero conditions, normal <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> are suspended. Residual {{capabilities}} will dictate {{what type}} flights can be continued. <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> Rule flights {{are not permitted}} as safe separation cannot be assured under ATC Zero. If weather conditions permit, Visual Flight Rules flights can be continued {{if they do not}} impact military or emergency response flights. The ATC Zero condition and any additional specific restrictions would be published by the FAA as a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) for the airspace involved. The TFR would state what aircraft are permitted into the affected airspace (e.g., military, first responders, fire fighting, surveillance) and under what constraints and requirements those flights can operate.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental research program {{was conducted to}} develop criteria for pilot interaction with advanced controls and displays in single pilot <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> rules (SPIFR) <b>operations.</b> The analytic phase reviewed fundamental considerations for pilot workload taking into account existing data, and using that data to develop a divided attention SPIFR pilot workload model. The pilot model was utilized to interpret the two experimental phases. The first experimental phase was a flight test program that evaluated pilot workload {{in the presence of}} current and near-term displays and autopilot functions. The second experiment was conducted on a King Air simulator, investigating the effects of co-pilot functions in the presence of very high SPIFR workload. The results indicate that the simplest displays tested were marginal for SPIFR operations. A moving map display aided the most in mental orientation, but had inherent deficiencies as a stand alone replacement for an HSI. Autopilot functions were highly effective for reducing pilot workload. The simulator tests showed that extremely high workload situations can be adequately handled when co-pilot functions are provided...|$|R
