25|$|IC design can {{be divided}} into the broad {{categories}} of digital and analog IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, memories (RAM, ROM, and flash) and digital ASICs. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and RF IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of op-amps, linear regulators, phase locked loops, oscillators and active filters. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as <b>gain,</b> <b>matching,</b> power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.|$|E
40|$|Extremely small-area sensor {{front-ends}} {{are required}} for cost-constrained automotive applications. Instrumentation amplifiers (IA) for such front-ends must process multi-channel sensor outputs and provide <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> over the channels for proper sensor operation. Angular sensors are a typical example, in which the sine and cosine outputs of a resistive magnetic sensor must be processed with adequate <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> to avoid unacceptable angular errors. This paper presents a 2 -channel instrumentation amplifier in 0. 16 μm CMOS with 0. 1 % <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> and occupying 0. 035 mm 2 per channel. This represents a 13. 3 × area improvement with respect to state-of-the-art designs with similar gain accuracy [1]-[4], while maintaining low noise (18. 7 nV/√Hz), low offset (17 μV) and high power efficiency (NEF= 12. 9).

40|$|Sponsored by : IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques SocietyThe {{theoretical}} minimum noise {{measure of}} a multipath amplifier (an amplifier that has multiple parallel amplifiers) is achieved by using the optimum source impedance and optimum gain for each amplification path. This optimum source impedance and gain can be calculated by replacing each amplifier with its optimum source impedance. The resulting noise measure {{is the same as}} the minimum noise measure of the amplifiers used. The theory is demonstrated by applying it to distributed am plifiers. In an ideal distributed amplifier, the magnitude of the optimum gain of the amplification paths decreases and the phase delay increases the farther the stage is from the input, with the decrease in gain being faster for higher frequencies. The challenge in designing broadband low-noise distributed amplifiers is to achieve optimum <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> over broad bandwidths. A numerical optimization procedure that separates source impedance and <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> is proposed and demonstrated by optimizing a 0. 5 - 2 -GHz distributed amplifier. An average noise measure of 0. 3 dB is achieved, which is only 0. 1 dB higher than the minimum noise measure of the amplification stages used. This increase is due to transmission line loss and gain mismatch. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design RF circuits using silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) for communication system. The packaging effect for the SiGe chip using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) is presented and methodology to derive {{the model for the}} package is discussed. Chapter 1, we discuss the overview and benefits of SiGe HBT technology in high frequency circuit design. Chapter 2 presents the methodology of the low noise amplifier (LNA) design and discusses the trade-off between the noise and <b>gain</b> <b>matching.</b> The technique for achieving simultaneous noise and <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> for the LNA is also presented. Chapter 3 presents an L-band cascaded feedback SiGe low noise amplifier (LNA) design for use in Global Position System (GPS) receivers. Implemented in a 200 GHz SiGe BiCMOS technology, the LNA occupies 1 x 1 millimeter square (including the bondpads). The SiGe LNA exhibits a gain greater than 23 dB from 1. 1 to 2. 0 GHz, and a noise figure of 2. 7 to 3. 3 dB from 1. 2 to 2. 4 GHz. At 1. 575 GHz, the 1 -dB compression point (P 1 dB) is 1. 73 dBm, with an input third-order intercept point (IIP 3) of - 3. 98 dBm. Lastly, Chapter 4 covers the packaging techniques for the SiGe monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC). We present the modeling of a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) package for use with an X-band SiGe HBT Low Noise Amplifier (LNA). The package consists of a 2 mil LCP laminated over an embedded SiGe LNA, with vias in the LCP serving as interconnects to the LNA bondpads. An accurate model for the packaging interconnects has been developed and verified by comparing to measurement results, and can be used in chip/package co-design. M. S.

40|$|Pattern {{matching}} algorithm {{is simple and}} fast comparing to other {{matching algorithm}}s such as Boolean matching. One major draw-back of the pattern matching {{is that there is}} a case where a cell needs a lot of patterns representing its logic function. That is be-cause patterns are decomposed into 2 -AND/NOT patterns to match against decomposed subject graphs. Furthermore, the conventional technology mapper does not pay much attention to relations among patterns. Each pattern is tried to match independently. In this paper, a novel pattern matching algorithm that does not require patterns to be decomposed and couple of speeding up techniques utilizing inter-relations among cells are described. These methods are very effective for large cell libraries with complex cells. Experimental results show that our methods <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> time up to 40 times faster. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 10 -bit 50 MS/s 300 mW CMOS ADC employing time-interleaved, 4 -stage pipelined configuration. To reduce power dissipation, Reference Feed-Forward architecture is introduced. In this architecture, resistive-load differential amplifiers (DifAMPs) are used between two pipline stages instead of high-gain high-speed amplifiers. The <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> of the reference voltage {{with the internal}} signal range is achieved by a reference generator (RefGEN) having the same characteristics as a DAC/subtractor (DA/subt) circuit. The offset voltages of the DifAMPs are canncelled by the offset cancellation technique. The front-end sample/hold (S/H) circuit is eliminated to reduce power dissipation. By introducing highspeed comparators based on source follower and latch circuit into the 1 ststage A/D subconverter (ADSC), analog bandwidth is not degraded. 1.

40|$|An {{important}} drawback {{of current}} biopotential monitoring systems is {{their dependence on}} gel electrodes, which can dry out, cause skin irritation, and necessitate skilled personnel. These associated drawbacks increase the running costs and significantly hamper their use in consumer healthcare and lifestyle applications. Unfortunately, the use of gel-free, or dry, electrodes increases the electrode-tissue contact impedance, thus exacerbating the effects of interference and cable motion artifacts. A solution {{is the use of}} active electrodes, i. e. electrodes in which an amplifier with high input impedance, low noise and good electrode offset rejection is co-integrated. Previous active electrodes employed voltage buffers to facilitate the inter-channel <b>gain</b> <b>matching</b> necessary to achieve high CMRR. However, low-noise buffers consume significant power and due to their lack of gain still require a low-noise and thus power-hungry back-end to keep the total integrated noise at acceptable levels. To reduce the total power dissipation, this paper proposes a biopotential monitoring system based on active electrodes with gain...|$|E

40|$|The {{in-phase}} and quadrature modulator (IQ modulator) is a {{key component}} in modern wireless transmitter. It provides a convenient method for modulating data bits or symbols onto an RF carrier. It has become the architecture of choice for implementing transmitter signal chains for end applications such as cellular, WiMAX, and wireless point-to-point. However, there are several non-ideal aspects of analog IQ modulator, include IQ gain imbalance, imperfect quadrature, and LO leakage. These imperfections will result in image spectral and degrade MER of the modulator, which in turn degrades bit error rate (BER). <b>Gain</b> <b>matching</b> and phase compensation both affect {{the total amount of}} image rejection.
