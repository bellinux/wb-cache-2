40|$|Abstract: Focussing on {{the prime}} example of CO 2 emissions, we discuss several {{important}} theoretical and econometric problems that arise when studying environmental <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curves</b> (EKCs). The dominant theoretical approach is given by integrated assessment modelling, which consists of economic models that are combined with environmental impact models. We critically evaluate the aggregation, model dynamics and calibration aspects and their implications for {{the validity of the}} results. We then turn to a discussion of several important econometric problems that go almost unnoticed in the literature. The most fundamental problems relate to nonlinear transformations of nonstationary regressors and, in a nonstationary panel context, to neglected cross-sectional dependence. We discuss the implications of these two major and some minor problems that arise in the econometric analysis of <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curves.</b> Our discussion shows that EKC modelling as performed to date is subject to major drawbacks atboth the theoretical and the econometric level. ...|$|R
40|$|Empirical <b>Kuznets</b> <b>Curves</b> (EKC) usually imply an {{inverted}} U-shaped {{relationship between a}} pollutant and per capita GDP growth. We initially find {{an inverted}} U-shaped EKC between CO 2 -emissions and per capita GDP for the period 1960 to 2004. However, once accounting for a major uprising in 1988 in Myanmar, we can identify two different growth regimes. This structural break changes {{the nature of the}} EKC relationship. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{environmental}} <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve</b> is a hypothesized {{relationship between}} environmental quality and economic development: various indicators {{of environmental degradation}} tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point {{over the course of}} development. Although the subject of continuing debate, some evidence supports the claim that environmental health indicators, such as water and air pollution, show the inverted U-shaped curve. It has been argued that this trend occurs in the level of many of the environmental pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, lead, DDT, chlorofluorocarbons, sewage, and other chemicals previously released directly into the air or water.|$|E
25|$|Plotting the {{relationship}} between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what {{is now known as}} the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve.</b> Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter. However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory. It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector. This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.|$|E
25|$|A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph has a {{measures}} trade openness {{along the}} x-axis and inequality along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by {{the ratio of}} exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary school enrolment rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization. By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve</b> seems {{to apply to the}} relationship between trade liberalization and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient). However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality felt.|$|E

According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by economists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan University in China), financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution and financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution.

25|$|The <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve</b> {{implies that}} as a nation {{undergoes}} industrialization – and especially the mechanization of agriculture – {{the center of the}} nation’s economy will shift to the cities. As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase. Inequality is then expected to decrease when a certain level of average income is reached and the processes of industrialization – democratization {{and the rise of the}} welfare state – allow for the trickle-down of the benefits from rapid growth, and increase the per-capita income. Kuznets believed that inequality would follow an inverted “U” shape as it rises and then falls again with the increase of income per-capita.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the Environment <b>Kuznet's</b> <b>Curve</b> (EKC) {{hypothesis}} for 43 developing countries. We suggest examining the EKC hypothesis {{based on the}} short- and long-run income elasticities; that is, if the long-run income elasticity is smaller than the short-run income elasticity then {{it is evident that}} a country has reduced carbon dioxide emissions as its income has increased. Our empirical analysis based on individual countries suggests that Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Yemen, Qatar, the UAE, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Algeria, Kenya, Nigeria, Congo, Ghana, and South Africa [...] approximately 35 per cent of the sample [...] carbon dioxide emissions have fallen over the long run; that is, as these economies have grown emissions have fallen since the long-run income elasticity is smaller than the short-run elasticity. We also examine the EKC hypothesis for panels of countries constructed on the basis of regional location using the panel cointegration and the panel long-run estimation techniques.

40|$|We draw on a {{dynamical}} two-sector {{model and}} on a calibration exercise to study {{the impact of a}} skill-biased technological shock on the growth path and income distribution of a developing economy. The model builds on the theoretical framework developed by Silverberg and Verspagen (1995) and on the idea of localised technological change (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1969) with sector-level increasing returns to scale. We find that a scenario of catching-up to the high-growth steady state is predictable for those economies starting off with a high enough endowment of skilled workforce. Dur ing the transition phase, if the skill upgrade process for the workforce is relatively slow, the typical inverse-U Kuznets pattern emerges for income inequality in the long run. Small-scale <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curves,</b> driven by sectoral business cycles, may also be de tected in the short run.

2500|$|The East Asian miracle {{has been}} used to criticize the {{validity}} of the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve</b> theory. The rapid economic growth of eight East Asian countries—Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore (Four Asian Tigers), Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia—between 1965 and 1990, was called the East Asian miracle (EAM). Manufacturing and export grew quickly and powerfully. Yet simultaneously, life expectancy was found to increase and population levels living in absolute poverty decreased. This development process was contrary to the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve</b> theory. Many studies have been done to identify how the EAM was able to ensure that the benefits of rapid economic growth were distributed broadly among the population, because Kuznets’ theory stated that rapid capital accumulation would lead to an initial increase in inequality. Joseph Stiglitz argues the East Asian experience of an intensive and successful economic development process along with an immediate decrease in population inequality {{can be explained by the}} immediate re-investment of initial benefits into land reform (increasing rural productivity, income, and savings), universal education (providing greater equality and what Stiglitz calls an “intellectual infrastructure” for productivity [...] ), and industrial policies that distributed income more equally through high and increasing wages and limited the price increases of commodities. These factors increased the average citizen’s ability to consume and invest within the economy, further contributing to economic growth. Stiglitz highlights that the high rates of growth provided the resources to promote equality, which acted as a positive-feedback loop to support the high rates of growth. The EAM defies the <b>Kuznets</b> <b>curve,</b> which insists growth produces inequality, and that inequality is a necessity for overall growth.|$|E
