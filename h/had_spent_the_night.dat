5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still {{on the ground in}} some places. Both Tom and Ike <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 23/24 April {{in their}} pits {{listening}} {{to the sounds of}} the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{began to}} {{circulate}} among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{prior to the}} body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's murder of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley {{was responsible for the}} death.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When {{the night was}} {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée assumed she <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
5|$|American {{casualties}} were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks {{and the cost}} of storming pillboxes. The Germans <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission. On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link-up with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the death of}} Miller and Stiles, every one {{of the rest of the}} gang was wounded, including Frank James and Pitts, both shot in their right legs. Jesse James was the last one to be shot, taking a bullet in the thigh as the gang escaped. The six surviving outlaws rode out of town on the Dundas Road toward Millersburg where four of them <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> before.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Maria and António <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> together. In <b>the</b> morning, Maria wakes {{first and}} notices the {{indentation}} on António's finger from his wedding ring. She deduces {{that he is}} not Tertuliano and demands she be allowed to leave.|$|R

25|$|The {{view of the}} German police {{was that}} Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5km from the apartment. Duggan's family complained {{that the police had}} failed to {{establish}} that. Other allegations included that he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road, and that he had run onto the road from a car. Forensic reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the coroner rejected in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Barry was {{one half}} of Walford's first {{homosexual}} couple. His boyfriend, Colin, had already been introduced to the show several months prior to Barry's arrival and he had proven to be an extremely popular addition to the cast. Both the audience and the residents of Walford had been {{kept in the dark}} about the fact that Colin was gay. This changed upon Barry's first scene on-screen, whereby the audience learnt that he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with Colin after picking him up the night before (off-screen) at a gay club.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April {{the last}} desperate combat sorties flown by the VNAF {{were carried out}} in defense of Tan Son Nhut. An AC-119 Shadow gunship, which <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{defending}} the base perimeter, landed for fuel and ammunition. After refueling and rearming, the Shadow took off again. The gunship orbited the air base firing on advancing NVA troops and was soon joined {{by a pair of}} A-1s. The Skyraiders made repeated runs over NVA positions until NVA gunners downed one with a SA-7. The second A-1 pilot continued his attacks until his fuel and ordnance were used up. All the while, the AC-119 kept its fire directed on advancing enemy forces.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th and 14th centuries some pilgrims to Canterbury journeyed via Billericay. Some of {{them may}} <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> in Billericay before {{crossing}} the River Thames at Tilbury. This {{may account for the}} large number of inns in the town.|$|R

25|$|In {{outlining}} {{the case for}} colleagues hours after {{the discovery of the}} body, Perugia Reparto volanti (Flying Squad) Detective Superintendent Monica Napoleoni told them that the murderer was definitely not a burglar and that apparent signs of a break-in were staged as a deliberate deception. Knox was the only occupant of the house who had been nearby {{on the night of the}} murder; she said she <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 1November with Sollecito at his flat. Over the next four days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed without being given access to a lawyer. She later testified that she was subjected to pressure tactics and struck by police to make her incriminate herself. She was arrested and charged with murder at noon on 6November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{had been}} in only one shootout and Morgan {{had never been in}} any gun battles. Billy Claiborne {{had been in}} one gunfight prior to the shootout and was {{the only member of the}} Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting {{experience}} (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other than a couple of drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot. Both Tom and Ike <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from having been pistol-whipped by the Earps earlier that morning, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
25|$|The events {{surrounding}} Corrie's death are disputed. Fellow ISM activists {{said that the}} soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran Corrie over while she was acting as a human shield to prevent the demolition of the home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. They said she was between the bulldozer and a wall near Nasrallah's home, in which ISM activists <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> several times. Israeli eyewitnesses maintain that the death was accidental because the bulldozer operator was unable to see Corrie due to the vehicle's obstructed view. Furthermore, Israeli witnesses maintain that Corrie was not defending a house from being demolished and was instead inhibiting a military operation to find contraband weapons and smuggling tunnels in Gaza. An IDF officer testified in court that on that day they were only clearing vegetation and rubble from houses that were previously demolished, and that no new houses were slated for demolition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Dunwoodie, Isabella?" [...] he said. [...] "The {{excellent}} fellow {{is never}} weary of kind actions.

25|$|Vandenbroucke made {{headlines}} in 1999 {{for the first}} of many drug problems, arrested by Paris police but then released. In 2001 he was stopped on the E17 motorway in Belgium in a speeding car shared with Bernard Sainz, the so-called Dr Mabuse of cycling. Sainz was jailed in 2008 for falsely practising medicine. Sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as clenbuterol, morphine and EPO, which is used in sport as a blood-booster. Sainz insisted they were homeopathic products. After Sainz said he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at Vandenbroucke's house, police acquired a search warrant from a court in Termonde and searched Vandenbroucke's house with drugs specialists. There they found small quantities of more drugs which Vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog. Vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station. Two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment. Among them was his rival, Peter van Petegem. Vandenbroucke was banned by the Flemish cycling federation from riding in Belgium for six months.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon breakfasted off {{silver plate}} at Le Caillou, {{the house where}} he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> When Soult {{suggested}} that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, [...] "Just because {{you have all been}} beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast".|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{moved to}} Rotherham during the 2004 season {{to be with}} his fiancée, Clare, whom he married in July 2005. Murphy's wife filed for divorce in 2009 on the grounds of {{infidelity}} after The People newspaper published an exposé revealing he <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with an escort girl he had met at a religious youth group. Murphy's then manager, Brandon Parker, issued a statement confirming that Murphy had slept with the woman but denied he had been unfaithful, stating that Murphy did not have sex with her. He also dated Claire Chorlton, who was first introduced to the viewing public backstage during the final of the 2012 UK Championship.|$|E
50|$|Always {{one with}} a flair for the dramatic, Holmes {{literally}} has the treaty served up to Phelps as breakfast {{the next morning at}} 221B Baker Street, where he <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> under Watson's watchful eyes (although there has been no danger). Phelps is ecstatic, Holmes is quietly triumphant, and once again, Watson is dumbfounded.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Honey Pie, who <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{trapped in}} a store, is ambushed {{by one of the}} monsters.

500|$|At {{dawn the}} VNAF began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A-37s, F-5s, C-7s, C-119s and C-130s {{departed}} for Thailand while UH-1s {{took off in}} search of the ships of TF-76. Some VNAF aircraft stayed to continue to fight the advancing PAVN. One AC-119 gunship <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching PAVN. At dawn on 29 April two A-1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at [...] until one was shot down, presumably by an SA-7 missile.

500|$|After Jade {{challenged}} Mark {{to a game}} of pool, [...] "sparks of {{a different}} kind" [...] began to fly between them. McGregor explained the situation: [...] "Mark has had a really bad day at work, so he's out for a fun night. To his surprise, he enjoys Jade's company. Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss." [...] The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> together and Mark was full of regret. Mark was [...] "terrified" [...] that Kate would find out and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet, he does not feel any less guilty. Mark's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down. Despite talking to his superior officer, nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place.|$|E
500|$|By {{the night}} of 28 April, North Vietnamese {{artillery}} and rockets were hitting Tan Son Nhut. [...] At dawn on 29 April, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A-37s, F-5s, C-7s, C-119s, and C-130s departed for Thailand, while UH-1 helicopters took {{off in search of}} the evacuation fleet of Task Force 76. [...] Some VNAF aircraft, however, did stay and continue to fight the advancing North Vietnamese. [...] One AC-119 gunship <b>had</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching North Vietnamese.
