50|$|In 2016, the nitrate <b>dupe</b> <b>negative</b> {{with the}} English soundtrack was {{discovered}} to exist. A 2K scan restoration {{was made by}} Lobster Films, {{and this is going}} into theatrical release, and later home media release by Kino Lorber.|$|E
5000|$|Digital matting has {{replaced}} the traditional approach for two reasons. In the old system, the five separate strips of film (foreground and background originals, positive and negative mattes, and copy stock) could drift slightly out of registration, resulting in halos and other edge artifacts in the result. Done correctly, digital matting is perfect, down to the single-pixel level. Also, the final <b>dupe</b> <b>negative</b> was a [...] "third generation" [...] copy, and film loses quality each time it is copied. Digital images can be copied without quality loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} reissued as Killer Bait in 1955. Too Late for Tears {{has been in}} the public domain for many years and has since gained a cult following; there are several {{different}} edits of the film with different running times. On January 25, 2014, a restored 35mm print was premiered by the Film Noir Foundation at Noir City 12 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The film was restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Film Noir Foundation, with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association providing some of the necessary funding. The restoration combined 35mm <b>dupe</b> <b>negative</b> elements from France with some material from surviving prints.|$|E
5000|$|In most of Harryhausen's films, model {{animated}} characters interact with, {{and are a}} part of, {{the live}} action world, {{with the idea that}} they will cease to call attention to themselves as only [...] "animation." [...] Most of the effects shots in his earliest films were created via Harryhausen's careful frame-by-frame control of the lighting of both the set and the projector. This dramatically reduced much of degradation common in the use of back-projection or the creation of <b>dupe</b> <b>negatives</b> via the use of an optical printer. Harryhausen's use of diffused glass to soften the sharpness of light on the animated elements allowed the matching of the soft background plates far more successfully than Willis O'Brien had achieved in his early films, allowing Harryhausen to match live and miniature elements seamlessly in most of his shots. By developing and executing most of this miniature work himself, Harryhausen saved money, while maintaining full technical control.A few years later, when Harryhausen began working with color film to make The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he experimented extensively with color film stocks to overcome the color-balance-shift problems. Ray's producer/partner Charles H. Schneer coined the word Dynamation as a [...] "merchandising term" [...] (modifying it to [...] "SuperDynaMation" [...] and then [...] "Dynarama" [...] for some subsequent films).|$|R
5000|$|Wade Williams {{actually}} {{discovered an}} Italian language nitrate {{print of the}} film {{in the basement of}} an old mansion in Rome in 1981 belonging to his friend and Italian film producer Luigi Cozzi aka Lewis Coates. Forry Ackerman, his wife Wyndane, the Mossman Brothers and Wade Williams were guest speakers at a Science-Fiction Festival in Rome. Forry Ackerman verified it was a lost film in the US. Wade Williams bought the access rights, made a <b>dupe</b> preservation <b>negative</b> and 35MM print. It was sub-titled in English for the first US re-release on VHS by Englewood Entertainment and the 35MM print was re-released theatrically and played at the Film Forum in New York and other revival houses and archives.

25|$|Later that year, Méliès {{made the}} féerie Cinderella, based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale. The film was six minutes long {{and had a}} cast of over 35 people, {{including}} Bleuette Bernon in the title role. It was also Méliès' first film with multiple scenes, known as tableaux. The film was very successful across Europe and in the United States, playing mostly in fairgrounds and music halls. American film distributors such as Siegmund Lubin were especially in need of new material both to attract their audience with new films and to counter Edison's growing monopoly. Méliès' films were particularly popular, and Cinderella was often screened as a featured attraction even years after its U.S. release in December 1899. Such U.S. filmmakers as Thomas Edison were resentful of the competition from foreign companies and after the success of Cinderella, attempted to block Méliès from screening most films in the U.S.; but they soon discovered {{the process of creating}} film <b>dupes</b> (duplicate <b>negatives).</b> Méliès and others then established the trade union Chambre Syndicale des Editeurs Cinématographiques as a way to defend themselves in foreign markets. Méliès was made the first president of the union, serving until 1912, and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was the group's headquarters.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Momijigari {{became the}} first film to be {{designated}} an Important Cultural Property under Japan's Law for the Protection for Cultural Properties. What has specifically received that designation is a <b>dupe</b> <b>negative</b> 35mm celluloid print of the film that is 352 feet in length, which if projected at 16 frames per second would be 3 minutes and 50 seconds long. The film historian Aaron Gerow, however, has speculated that the film received this designation less {{because it was an}} example of the legacy of Japanese film art than because it was a historical document. The print is preserved at the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between camera stocks and print stocks involves {{a difference in}} the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more <b>Dupe</b> <b>Negative</b> (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.|$|E
