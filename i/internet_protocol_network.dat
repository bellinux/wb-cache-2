25|$|IPv6 is not {{directly}} interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet {{not directly}} accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol.</b> <b>Network</b> infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.|$|E
