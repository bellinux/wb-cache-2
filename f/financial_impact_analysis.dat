40|$|This {{research}} examines {{both social}} and financial {{impacts of the}} privatization of municipally-owned transit systems {{from the perspective of}} a privatizing city and its citizens by studying the case of Yokohama, Japan's second largest city whose transit systems are now subject to privatization arguments. First, privatization models are defined based on two dimensions - degree of privatization and deregulation, which are frequently commingled and misused. Then, this research examines the social impact on fare levels, service quality, safety, service provision, and labor condition is analyzed based on prior privatization cases such as Singapore's MRT system, the UK municipal bus systems, and Japan National Rails. Third, this research suggests a new framework and methodology based on the perpetuity valuation for <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>analysis</b> and quantifies the financial value of each option from the perspective of the City of Yokohama and its citizens. (cont.) Based on the above analysis, this research concludes that publicly-controlled full privatization in which government retains regulatory power over a privatized entity after full privatization is the most effective managerial model among the examined options at least for the City of Yokohama because this option maximizes the net financial value (Citizens' Equity Value) for the city, while at the same time minimizing the social risks potentially caused by privatization. More generally, this research recommends that government should keep its control over a privatized public transit service even after full privatization and should not rely much on market mechanism in order to alleviate public concerns and protect public interest. Because transit privatization is a hot public policy issue discussed widely among major municipalities in Japan and in developed nations, this research is expected to provide evidence and policy guidelines not only for Yokohama but also for other municipalities in developed nations that own and operate transit systems. by Tsukihito Nakajima.

40|$|This Article advocates that {{financial}} regulators analyze, measure, and {{take into account}} the emotional impacts of their policies and procedures. Examples of emotional impacts are investor confidence, process concerns, and overall market or social mood. Investor confidence or trust in securities markets, process concerns about how much securities regulators actually deliberate over proposed rules, and financial anxiety or investment stress affect and are affected by financial economic variables, such as consumer debt, consumer expenditures, consumer wealth, corporate investment, initial public offerings, and securities market demand, liquidity, prices, supply, and volume. Cost-benefit analysis does not quantitatively consider interdependencies between regulations’ emotional <b>impacts</b> and their <b>financial</b> outcomes. Emotional <b>impact</b> <b>analysis</b> does.

40|$|Access to {{loans and}} credit {{facilities}} has been, and still is, {{a major problem}} for {{a large portion of the}} South African society. The problem is particularly significant in the disadvantaged and rural areas where the majority of people do not have access to formal banking services. Against this background the government further exacerbated the problem by prescribing legislation, which is thought to protect borrowers from perceived usurious rates. This particular law in contention is the Usury Act (No. 73 of 1968). The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money lending institutions. The objective of this study was to examine the impact that interest rate ceilings will have on the micro lending market. This was done through looking at a case study based on information obtained from a micro lender. Firstly the study undertook the <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> <b>analysis</b> on a micro lending business to determine the effect of a change in the maximum interest rate that could be charged by the micro lenders. This process was conducted to help understand the costs, revenues and profits of a micro lending business. The data, which were based on the micro lender’s financial statements, were analysed and evaluated on the basis that the statements reflect the financial position of the micro lender charging an interest rate not exceeding 30 per cent. Calculations were then made to reflect their financial position in the event of them being allowed to charge a maximum rate of 20 per cent, 12. 08 per cent and 10 per cent per month. The results showed that micro lenders could make a profit when charging rates of between 30 and 20 per cent. However when the interest rate is reduced to 10 per cent the micro lender start to lose. The bottom line for micro lenders is greatly influenced by their turnover, as large portions of their costs are fixed. Therefore one micro lender might earn economic profits at 12. 08 per cent per month, while another might just break-even. Simple and multiple regression techniques were used to analyse the data pertinent to the study. The analyses were performed to show the impact, which ceilings on the interest rate have on the market structure, company size and on the characteristics of loan services. The results were evaluated according to their significance. The findings showed that interest rate ceilings can have positive significant effect on risk and the market structure. Based on the findings of both methods applied to this study, it is evident that the interest rate ceilings could act as a constraint to the provision of credit to low-income earners and operators of small and micro enterprises. The micro lenders offer small amounts of credit to a large number of people, therefore interest rate ceilings may not only ration consumers out of the legal market, but also drive smaller lenders from the market and thus diminish competition.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} provide a directional sense of some key considerations for business continuity planning (BCP) specific to a company's downstream distribution operations in the U. S. This was achieved via a two-pronged strategy comprised of quantitative and qualitative elements to complement insights gained from the literature review. By quantitatively assessing the <b>financial</b> <b>impacts</b> arising from four hypothetical scenarios, the business <b>impact</b> <b>analysis</b> (BIA) showcased the merits of short time-to-recovery (TTR) {{in the event of a}} disruption. However, available information also appears to suggest that the estimated <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> from carrying high-value inventory is not necessarily insignificant. Hence, a company may want to mitigate the likelihood of a scenario whereby large amounts of inventory become damaged. Qualitative information from industry participants in the study highlighted the importance of tailoring continuity plans to the unique supply chain needs of an organization. by Arthur K. L.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{evaluate}} the tools {{used to measure the}} financial value of libraries in a clinical setting. Methods Searches were carried out on ten databases for the years 2003 — 2013, with a final search before completion to identify any recent papers. Results Eleven papers met the final inclusion criteria. There was no evidence of a single ‘best practice’, and many metrics used to measure <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> of clinical libraries were developed on an ad hoc basis locally. The most common measures of <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> were value of time saved, value of resource collection against cost of alternative sources, cost avoidance and revenue generated through assistance on grant submissions. Few papers provided an insight into the longer term impact on the library service resulting from submitting return on investment (ROI) or other <b>financial</b> <b>impact</b> statements. Conclusions There are limited examples of metrics which clinical libraries can use to measure explicit <b>financial</b> <b>impact.</b> The methods highlighted in this literature review are generally implicit in the measures used and lack robustness. There is a need for future research to develop standardised, validated tools that clinical libraries can use to demonstrate their <b>financial</b> <b>impact...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-country}} petroleum pipelines are {{environmentally sensitive}} because they traverse through varied terrain covering crop fields, forests, rivers, populated areas, desert, hills and offshore. Any malfunction of these pipelines may cause devastating {{effect on the}} environment. Hence, the pipeline operators plan and design pipelines projects with sufficient consideration of environment and social aspects along with the technological alternatives. Traditionally, in project appraisal, optimum technical alternative is selected using <b>financial</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Impact</b> assessments (IA) are then carried out to justify the selection and subsequent statutory approval. However, the IAs often suggest alternative sites and/or alternate technology and implementation methodology, resulting in revision of entire technical and financial analysis. This study addresses the above issues by developing an integrated framework for project feasibility analysis with the application of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multiple attribute decision-making technique. The model considers technical analysis (TA), socioeconomic IA (SEIA) and environmental IA (EIA) in an integrated framework to select the best project from a few alternative feasible projects. Subsequent financial analysis then justifies the selection. The entire methodology has been explained here through a case application on cross-country petroleum pipeline project in India...|$|R
