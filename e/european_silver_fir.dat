40|$|Aim: Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to modify growth trends of forests around the world. However, this modification may vary in strength and intensity across a species' biogeographical range. Here, we study <b>European</b> populations of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba) across its southern distribution limits in Spain, Italy and Romania. We hypothesized that growth trends of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> will differ across its distribution range, with a marked decline in growth in drought-prone regions near the species' southernmost biogeographical limits. Location: Europe (Spain, Italy, Romania). Methods: We collected tree-ring data from at least 1300 <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees located in 111 sites. The dataset {{was used to assess}} and model growth trends, quantified as changes in basal area increment, and to determine how growth responds to climate. Results: We found contrasting patterns of basal area increments among countries and sites. Populations of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> located outside the Mediterranean area (e. g. northern Italy, Romania) have shown a clear increase in growth over the last two decades, whereas most populations in Spain and southern Italy have displayed a marked decline in growth since the 1980 s. The growth of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forests at the south-western distribution limit is severely constrained by low spring-summer water availability, whereas growth of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> forests in non-Mediterranean areas is limited by cold conditions in late winter to early spring. Main conclusions: Climate warming is distinctly modifying growth patterns and responses to climate in <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> across most of the species' European distribution area. In south-western Europe the reduction in growth of many populations is related to an observed increase in aridity, whereas in more temperate areas warming is enhancing growth. Our results confirm a decline in the growth of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> at its south-western distribution limits as a consequence of climate warming. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageIn mixed forests, coarse woody debris {{promotes}} the successful establishment {{and growth of}} conifers and beech. In contrast to beech and fir, older spruce seedlings were only present on coarse woody debris {{and not on the}} forest floor. ContextCoarse woody debris (CWD) is considered a suitable seedbed for small-seeded and light-demanding species. Its role in enhancing tree regeneration is well reported in boreal or subalpine spruce forests. Less is known about its role in the establishment, growth, and survival of other species, particularly in mixed forests. AimsWe analyzed the role of CWD in seedling establishment, growth, and survival for <b>European</b> beech, <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> and Norway spruce. MethodsWe tracked the growth and survival of all germinants and seedlings over 5  years. ResultsConifers were relatively more successful than beech at colonizing on CWD. The density of seedlings was variable in all CWD decay classes but was the highest on well-decomposed CWD. CWD supported the growth of all species. Beech cohorts and older seedlings had similar mortality rates on both microsites. Spruce germinants did not survive on the forest floor for more than a year, and older seedlings were only observed on CWD. Fir cohorts had similar mortality rates on both microsites, but older seedlings survived better on the forest floor. ConclusionAlthough the three species differed in their preferred microsite for establishment, CWD can be considered a suitable regeneration microsite for all three species by enhancing their growth and, in the case of spruce, both short- and long-term survival...|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the characteristics}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba Mill.) occurrence and distribution in Slovenia using databases of the Slovenian Forest Service (SFS). <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> is the third most widely distributed tree species in Slovenia, occurring in approximately 40 % of total forest area, but abundantly in less than 10 %. Its share in total growing stock varies between separate forest management regions. It is more abundant in the Dinaric {{and part of the}} Pre-alpine phytogeographic regions. The highest share in total growing stock reaches at altitudes between 800 m and 1000 m above sea level, forests with <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> cover the most extensive surface in the altitude belt from 1000 to 1200 m. <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> occurs abundantly in 11 syntaxes. Between them, silver fir-beech forests (Abieti-Fagetum dinaricum TREG. 57, syn. : Omphalodo-Fagetum (TREG. 57 corr. PUNC. 80) MAR et al. 93) strongly prevail, followed by fir forests with fern (Dryopterido-Abietetum KOŠ. 65, syn. : Galio rotundifolii-Abietetum BARTSCH. 40). <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> diameter distribution considerably varies between separate forest management regions. The regions with the highest share of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Postojna, Kočevje) dominate also in having large diameter <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees, whereas in other regions (e. g.

Successful regeneration due to lower red deer population and balanced stem diameter structure with higher proportion of small diameter trees promise easier conservation of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> in northern parts...|$|R

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> are of high importance for selection forest management, {{and for the}} current aims laid out in Serbia’s forest management focused on increasing the share of <b>silver</b> <b>firs</b> in Serbia’s growing stock. With the objective of increasing {{the understanding of the}} growth {{characteristics of}} <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> the growth of two <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> trees felled during forest site production research on Mt. Goč, located in Central Serbia, have been analyzed. Both trees showed significant differences in their growth dynamics over long periods as results of micro-site and micro-stand effects (primarily ambient light regime). The common growth characteristic of the two trees, a 450 -year-old tree as the main study object (labeled Tree A) and a 270 -year-old Tree B is a long stagnation stage. For Tree A the latent phase, with small interruptions, lasted 410 years; one phase lasted 330 years in continuity, which is the longest period of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> stagnation recorded in Europe. Tree B showed a long-lasting stagnation stage that lasted 170 years. The long stagnation stage of Tree A, characterized by an average diameter increment of 1. 4 mm/year (average growth ring width of 0. 7 mm) and an average height increment of 0. 08 m/year, shows the extraordinary <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> capacity for physiological survival in complete shade.
