40|$|Project 4. 2 was {{designed}} to study direct (primary) air blast injury, in animals, from an atomic weapon {{in the range of}} 20 to 50 psi under circumstances affording protection against missiles, thermal and ionizing radiation and to estimate the probable direct air blast hazard in man. The pressure levels at which atomic weapons direct air blast injuries occur will determine, to a large extent, the number of blast casualties likely to be encountered. It is probable that fatal overpressures are not reached until well within the range at which indirect (secondary) blast, thermal and ionizing radiation are practically certain to prove fatal. Only in special situations affording partial protection from other injuries are blast injuries likely to be of practical importance. Two animal species of widely different body weights (700 rats and 56 dogs) were exposed, together with air pressure recorders, in aluminum cylinders, covered by sandbags and dirt but open at both ends, at seven stations distributed within the intended overpressure range of 20 to 50 psi of Shot 10 « About 200 rats were likewise exposed in Shot 9. Unfortunately, the destructive effect of the air blast of Shot 10 was much greater than anticipated. Many of the exposure cylinders were displaced and their contents destroyed. Only a partial recovery of the animals was possible due to the excessive radioactive contamination which greatly limited the time in the area. Most of the animals were dead upon recovery. Those living were in a state of severe shock. Autopsy findings showed remarkably few traumatic lesions and lung hemorrhages in spite of the rough treatment and high overpressure to which they were subjected. The rats recovered from Shot 9 were exposed to a recorded pressure of 18 to 2 k psi. The autopsy findings showed moderate lung hemorrhage in most of the animals undoubtedly due to direct air blast injury. The findings were typical of those seen following exposure to air blast from HE or in the shock tube. The agreement between the estimated pressures and the recorded pressures in the containers were good in some instances but not in others. Discounting the initial pressure rise, it was thought that the records represent the pressure changes in the <b>exposure</b> <b>containers.</b> The individual records exhibited rather wide variations in recorded pressures indicating a complex pressure field. The attempt to compare levels of direct air blast in small and large animals, and thereby to extrapolate to man, was not accomplished {{due to the lack of}} statistically reliable data on the dogs. The lapse of time between the death of the dogs and autopsy reduced the interpretable findings below the level required for statistical significance. Laboratory studies are planned to evaluate the relative importance of the several blast wave parameters in the production of injury, Recommendations for future field test studies will depend upon the outcome of this laboratory work...|$|R

Course organization is {{an exploration of the}} plethora of commonly used implementation structures, along with analysis of their run-time costs and benefits. This paper examines an alternative organization of this course that uses inheritance and polymorphism as the primary means for organizing presentation and student projects in implementation, testing and application of data structures. Abstract sequence, map and set interfaces provide a conceptual and code-concrete framework within which students implement and extend arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, iterators and other structures. Reuse of student design and code modules fits seamlessly into this organization, saving time and effort and reinforcing the utility of reused classes. Achieving working <b>exposure</b> to type-generic <b>container</b> classes and class libraries is straightforward.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop and standardize a novel feeding bioassay with Macrobrachium rosenbergii for use in the laboratory and allowing it to be easily deployed under field conditions. Standardization of the test aimed to minimize feeding rate variations and to ensure that subsequent statistical analyses have sufficient power to consistently detect changes in feeding rates. These were accomplished through the development of a post-exposure feeding toxicity test under laboratory, microcosm and in situ/field conditions. This procedure was proven to be repeatable and economical. M. rosenbergii as test animals were available in terms of quantity and uniformity in sizes. The standard guidelines and procedures for M. rosenbergii bioassay developed from this study include the size of test animals (9 - 10 mm), density in <b>exposure</b> <b>containers</b> (10 animals in 500 mL of medium in the laboratory, 10 animals in field chambers with 98. 6 mL volume), exposure time (24 hours), feeding period for post-exposure feeding (4 hours) and number of replicates for the feeding test (10 replicates for individual measurements). The tiered approach used in the preliminary risk assessment of pesticide using TOXSWA was capable of screening the risk level of pesticide in the study area, identifying profenofos and dimethoate as test chemicals for the lethal and sub-lethal experiments. This model was beneficial in the preliminary risk assessment of pesticides in the tropics, since it was not necessary to set up laboratory work. This method could also provide preliminary data to support the environmental planner and decision/policy maker. This is an alternative way to develop a cost efficient model to inform and warn the risk of pesticide use. The effects of pH, temperature and hardness on control post-exposure feeding rates of M. rosenbergii were assessed and indicated that M. rosenbergii was very sensitive to acidic and basic conditions. The use of post-exposure feeding inhibition as the endpoint under laboratory conditions revealed that prawns were sensitive to pesticides (chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and profenofos) and a heavy metal (zinc). Post-exposure feeding rate inhibition {{could be used as a}} sublethal endpoint as the EC 50 values obtained for chlorpyrifos and zinc were lower than their lethal levels. Mortality of prawn was also another endpoint used to define the toxicity of pesticides such as carbendazim, in which mortality occurred during exposure, but post-exposure feeding rate of the surviving animals did not decrease. The microcosm experiments were able to link the laboratory toxicity tests and the effects observed in the field. Microcosm studies provided another dimension to studies looking at pesticide effects on aquatic systems. In this research, carbendazim affected feeding and survival rates in the microcosm set-up but in the laboratory only mortality showed a significant difference (P < 0. 05). In situ bioassays were able to show the effects of pesticides on post-exposure feeding rates using the methods developed. Post-exposure feeding rates were significantly lower than control in farms using pesticides while in uncontaminated sites (pesticide-free), the post-exposure feeding rates did not decrease. However, mortality was observed even in the uncontaminated sites which could be attributed to other factors such as low dissolved oxygen and presence of some other unidentified chemical substances. The degree of mortality and the effect on feeding rates depends not only on the type and concentration of the known pesticide but also on water quality parameters. The basic methods developed for in situ bioassay from this research is a simple, easy and fast way to determine the effect of pesticides because the results can be seen in the field. The procedures developed and results obtained from this study can be used as a basis for further toxicity studies on M. rosenbergii and other potential tropical species.

Two agricultural soils, polluted and unpolluted, were studied. Lettuce was cultivated {{for eight weeks}} before introduction of snails into the microcosms (M-snails). In a parallel experiment, snails were exposed to lettuce only (i. e., without soil) in simpler <b>exposure</b> devices called <b>containers</b> (C-snails). Snail <b>exposure</b> duration was eight weeks for both M- and C-snails. No effects on snail survival were found. Both M- and C-snails exposed to polluted soil showed a growth reduction, but only {{after two weeks of}} exposure. Time-dependent accumulation in M-snails exposed to the polluted environment showed a regular increase of Cd and Zn concentrations over time and a rapid increase of Pb concentrations within the first two weeks, which then remained stable. Copper and Ni concentrations did not increase during any of the experiments. Concentrations in M- and C-snails were compared to estimate the relative contribution of soil and plant to the total bioaccumulation.

40|$|Stentor araucanus is a mixotrophic ciliate that, in Andean lakes, inhabits {{the upper}} epilimnetic levels, which are {{commonly}} avoided by other planktonic organisms. This freshwater heterotrich has dark pigmented cortical granules and lives autotrophically with endosymbiotic algae. The effect of {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) -B radiation on primary production was analyzed during summer 2003 – 2004 in Lake Moreno Oeste, a highly transparent ultraoligotrophic lake (mean summer Kd 5 0. 16 m 21). Primary production (PP) was measured {{in the field in}} the euphotic zone during both static and variable-depth incubations. Static exposure of the organisms was examined at different depths (0. 30, 10, and 20 m), and the variable depth <b>exposure</b> involved experimental <b>containers</b> moved continuously up and down the epilimnion (0 – 15 m). In the static exposure closest to the surface and in the mobile incubation, quartz tubes were incubated with and without a UV-B screen (Mylary).

40|$|The Central Waste Complex (CWC) is {{the interim}} storage {{facility}} for Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) mixed waste, transuranic waste, transuranic mixed waste, low-level and low-level mixed radioactive waste at the Department of Energy's (DOE'S) Hanford Site. The {{majority of the}} waste stored at the facility is retrieved from the low-level burial grounds in the 200 West Area at the Site, with minor quantities of newly generated waste from on-site and off-site waste generators. The CWC comprises 18 storage buildings that house 13, 000 containers. Each waste container within the facility is scanned into its location by building, module, tier and position and the information is stored in a site-wide database. As waste is retrieved from the burial grounds, a preliminary non-destructive assay is performed {{to determine if the}} waste is transuranic (TRU) or low-level waste (LLW) and subsequently shipped to the CWC. In general, the TRU and LLW waste containers are stored in separate locations within the CWC, but the final disposition of each waste container is not known upon receipt. The final disposition of each waste container is determined by the appropriate program as process knowledge is applied and characterization data becomes available. Waste containers are stored within the CWC based on their physical chemical and radiological hazards. Further segregation within each building is done by container size (55 -gallon, 85 -gallon, Standard Waste Box) and waste stream. Due to this waste storage scheme, assembling waste containers for shipment out of the CWC has been time consuming and labor intensive. Qualitatively, the ratio of containers moved to containers in the outgoing shipment has been excessively high, which correlates to additional worker exposure, shipment delays, and operational inefficiencies. These inefficiencies impacted the LLW Program's ability to meet commitments established by the Tri-Party Agreement, an agreement between the State of Washington, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These commitments require waste containers to be shipped off site for disposal and/or treatment within a certain time frame. Because the program was struggling to meet production demands, the Production and Planning group was tasked with developing a method to assist the LLW Program in fulfilling its requirements. Using existing databases for container management, a single electronic spreadsheet was created to visually map every waste container within the CWC. The file displays the exact location (e. g., building, module, tier, position) of each container in a format that replicates the actual layout in the facility. In addition, each container was placed into a queue defined by the LLW and TRU waste management programs. The queues were developed based on characterization requirements, treatment type and location, and potential final disposition. This visual aid allows the user to select containers from similar queues and view their location within the facility. The user selects containers in a centralized location, rather than random locations, to expedite shipments out of the facility. This increases efficiency for generating the shipments, as well as decreasing worker <b>exposure</b> and <b>container</b> handling time when gathering containers for shipment by reducing movements of waste container. As the containers are collected for shipment, the remaining containers are segregated by queue, which further reduces future container movements...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work in}} practically determining how frequently used aerosol- and propane containers are affected at fire exposure from flammable liquids. The tested aerosol- and propane containers were chosen due to common appearance in ordinary grocery- and hardware stores. The tested aerosol containers had a volume range between 15 - 400 ml and the propane containers were filled with 0. 35, 0. 45, 5 and 6 kg of propane. The exposing heat source was burning liquid of heptane which corresponds to fire properties of common available flammable liquids that are for sale in ordinary stores. The study shows that the aerosol containers which are exposed to flames from a flammable liquid explodes within some minutes and develops often fire clouds within {{the vicinity of the}} exploding object. Minor aerosol containers, 15 - 400 ml, normally divide it selves into a few pieces when they explode. When storing several of minor aerosol containers together, unexploded aerosol containers can be expected to act as missiles as adjacent containers explode as they are exposed to flames from flammable liquids. In enclosures, the explosion also results in a significant blast wave. Fire exposed propane containers, named PC 5 (5 kg) and PA 6 (6 kg), releases pressure in different ways. The PC 5 container is made of composite material that seems to be partly combusted at heat exposure with following leakage through the composite material, pressure release through the safety valve cannot be determined to be the only way of releasing pressure at heat <b>exposure.</b> The aluminum <b>container</b> (PA 6) is designed both with a safety valve and a melting fuse. At one of the trials the safety valve opened briefly with a following release of the melting fuse. The opening of the melting fuse resulted in an outflow and pressure release of propane that initially developed a jet flame of 7 – 10 meters length. As the pressure went down, the jet flame decreased in length. The other test with the PA 6 container resulted in a more controlled pressure release by the safety valve during 5 opening intervals...|$|R
40|$|This drum-handling plan {{proposes a}} method to deal with unvented {{transuranic}} drums encountered during retrieval of drums. Finding unvented drums during retrieval activities was expected, as identified in the Transuranic (TRU) Phase I Retrieval Plan (HNF- 4781). However, significant numbers of unvented drums were not expected until excavation of buried drums began. This plan represents accelerated planning for management of unvented drums. A plan is proposed that manages unvented drums differently based on three categories. The first category of drums is any that visually appear to be pressurized. These will be vented immediately, using either the Hanford Fire Department Hazardous Materials (Haz. Mat.) team, if such are encountered before the facilities' capabilities are established, or using internal capabilities, once established. To date, no drums have been retrieved that showed signs of pressurization. The second category consists of drums that contain a minimal amount of Pu isotopes. This minimal amount is typically less than 1 gram of Pu, but may be waste-stream dependent. Drums in this category are assayed {{to determine if they}} are low-level waste (LLW). LLW drums are typically disposed of without venting. Any unvented drums that assay as TRU will be staged for a future venting campaign, using appropriate safety precautions in their handling. The third category of drums is those for which records show larger amounts of Pu isotopes (typically {{greater than or equal to}} 1 gram of Pu). These are assumed to be TRU and are not assayed at this point, but are staged for a future venting campaign. Any of these drums that do not have a visible venting device will be staged awaiting venting, and will be managed under appropriate controls, including covering the drums to protect from direct solar <b>exposure,</b> minimizing of <b>container</b> movement, and placement of a barrier to restrict vehicle access. There are a number of equipment options available to perform the venting. The preferred option is to use equipment provided by a commercial vendor during the first few years of retrieval and venting. This is based on a number of reasons. First, retrieval funding is uncertain. Using a commercial vendor will allow DOE-RL to avoid the investment and maintenance costs if retrieval is not funded. Second, when funding can be identified, retrieval will likely be performed with minimal initial throughput and intermittent operations. Again, costs can be saved by using contracted vendor services only as needed, rather than supporting Hanford equipment full time. When full-scale retrieval begins and the number of drums requiring venting increases significantly, then use of the Hanford container venting system (CVS) should be considered...|$|R
