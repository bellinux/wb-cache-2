5000|$|Edward Weston {{extensively}} {{improved the}} design. He replaced the fine wire suspension with a pivot, and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather {{like those of}} a wristwatch balance wheel hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated parallax observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical <b>equipment</b> <b>component.</b> It was known as a [...] "portable" [...] instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place.

The optimal level of life support system closure is evaluated for deep-space missions of varying duration using equivalent system mass (ESM) as the comparative basis. Reliability impacts are included in ESM by estimating the number of component spares required to meet a target system reliability. Common cause failures {{are included in the}} analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interrupter}} {{technique is}} commonly adopted to monitor respiratory resistance (Rrs,int) during mechanical ventilation; however, Rrs,int is often {{interpreted as an}} index of airway resistance (Raw). This study compared the values of Rrs,int provided by a Siemens 940 Lung Mechanics Monitor with total respiratory impedance (Zrs) parameters in 39 patients with normal spirometric parameters, who were undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery. Zrs was determined at the airway opening with pseudorandom oscillations of 0. 2 – 6 Hz at end inspiration. Raw and tissue resistance (Rti) were derived from the Zrs data by model fitting; Rti and total resistance (Rrs,osc=RawzRti) were calculated at the actual respirator frequencies. Lower airway resistance (Rawl) was estimated by measuring tracheal pressure. Although good agreement was obtained between Rrs,osc and Rrs,int, with a ratio of 1. 07 ¡ 0. 19 (mean¡SD), they correlated poorly (r 2 = 0. 36). Rti and the <b>equipment</b> <b>component</b> of Raw accounted for most of Rrs,osc (39. 8 ¡ 11. 9 and 43. 0 ¡ 6. 9 %, respectively), whereas {{only a small portion}} belonged to Rawl (17. 2 ¡ 6. 3 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Brazil {{is one of}} {{the only}} three and the first one from the {{developing}} world to initiate and maintain innovation capability especially in the switching <b>equipment</b> <b>component</b> of the telecommunications equipment industry. The maintenance of this capability has come under some strain with the increasing external integration of the Brazilian telecommunications economy. Employing a sectoral system of innovation perspective the paper undertakes a comprehensive evaluation of the efforts made by various components of the innovation system, and especially the research and policy-making parts, to maintain this capability. The ensuing analysis shows that the innovation system is learning to cope with changes in its external environment in a bid to maintain existing capability and has even managed to enhance capability in areas such as manufacturing and marketing. In order to cope with globalisation the Brazilian State has put in place a selected number of legal and fiscal instruments of state support.

40|$|Authorized SLAC {{personnel}} and subcontractors may use mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) to raise personnel, equipment, and working materials to elevated work areas. MEWPs (including scissors lifts, articulating boom aerial devices, and elevating platforms) offer flexible and versatile access to elevated locations. When work must be performed {{for extended periods}} of time at elevation and there is no guarded, fixed work surface available, it is generally appropriate to use a MEWP. When a MEWP is properly used, it can provide a useful working platform at heights, and is often safer than ladders or other access equipment. This chapter describes the minimum requirements for safely operating MEWPs at SLAC. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts The misuse of MEWPs can result in property damage, severe injury, or death. Accidents associated with MEWPs include tip / roll-overs, collapses, or personnel being thrown from the basket. The risk of falling or being pinned by a nearby structure is increased by an impact, ground movement, improper maneuvering by the operator, or failure of an <b>equipment</b> <b>component</b> that is critical to the stability of the MEWP.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} the full Vision for Space Exploration announced by former President George W. Bush in 2004, NASA will have {{to develop a new}} space transportation system and supporting infrastructure. The main portion of this supporting infrastructure will reside at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida and will either be newly developed or a modification of existing vehicle processing and launch facilities, including Ground Support Equipment (GSE). This type of large-scale launch site development is unprecedented since the time of the Apollo Program. In order to accomplish this successfully within the limited budget and schedule constraints a combination of traditional and innovative strategies for Verification and Validation (V&V) have been developed. The core of these strategies consists of a building-block approach to V&V, starting with component V&V and ending with a comprehensive end-to-end validation test of the complete launch site, called a Ground Element Integration Test (GEIT). This paper will outline these strategies and provide the high level planning for meeting the challenges of implementing V&V on a large-scale development program.
