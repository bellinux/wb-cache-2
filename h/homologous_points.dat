5000|$|Both {{methods have}} their weaknesses; the most {{dangerous}} (and easily overcome) is their susceptibility to noise in the outline.

[...] On the other hand, it is possible to apply them to complex curves without having to define a centroid; this makes removing the effect of location, size and rotation much simpler.The perceived failings of outline morphometrics are that it doesn't compare points of a homologous origin, and that it oversimplifies complex shapes by restricting itself to considering the outline and not internal changes. Also, since it works by approximating the outline by a series of ellipses, it deals poorly with pointed shapes.|$|E

Computer simulations of registration by <b>homologous</b> <b>point</b> matching are described along with a clinical study comparing <b>homologous</b> <b>point</b> matching and surface matching registration methods.

These measurements demonstrate the discrepancy that can be observed in the geometry of the frame when imaged with differing read-out gradient directions, and quantitatively evaluate the geometrical distortion associated with the image of the frame of known geometry. Since geometrical distortion of MR images can adversely affect the accuracy of IGNS, the three-point-Dixon MR pulse sequence is evaluated as a means of estimating the magnetic field inhomogeneity, and hence potential geometrical errors in images. Finally, an experimental comparison of mechanical and optical localizing devices is described, resulting in a quantitative estimate of the precision and accuracy of both systems...|$|R

The Interferometer Imaging Spectrometer (IIM) aboard the Chang'E- 1 lunar orbiter is the first multispectral imaging spectrometer for Chinese lunar missions. In this paper, we use the mosaic image of global moon acquired by the Wide-angle Camera (WAC) of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) to realize the accurate registration of Chang'E- 1 IIM hyperspectral images. Due {{to the lack of}} GCPs, the emphasis of this work is to find a huge number of <b>homologous</b> <b>points.</b> The method proposed in this paper is to obtain several <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> by manually matching, and then we utilize those points to calculate the initial homography matrix of LROC-WAC image and IIM image. This matrix is used to predict the area on IIM image where <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> may be located, and the locations of the <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> are determined by the orientation correlation in frequency domain. Finally we save the parts of <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> which satisfied the conversion relationship of initial homography matrix to calculate homography matrix again. We use this iterative way to obtain a more accurate location of the <b>homologous</b> <b>points.</b> In this process, we take into account that the geometric deformations of different regions on IIM image are quite different. Therefore, we added image threshold segmentation based on the initial homography matrix in the experiment, and completed the above work of finding the <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> on the segmented images. The final realization of registration accuracy of IIM images are in 1 – 2 pixels (RMSE).

40|$|This paper proposes an {{original}} image-matching algorithm for consecutive digital images acquired {{by means of}} the CCD sensor of a Mobile Mapping System (MMS). For such end, once a point is (manually) chosen in the “first” image, a Kalman filter based model is applied to automatically search for the <b>homologous</b> <b>point</b> in the “second” image. The matching geometric parameters are given from the six coefficients of the affine transformation from the template to the patch window, while the radiometric parameters are the two coefficients of the linear radiometric transformation between the same windows. The usual “Least Squares Matching” condition between template/patch grey-values is applied. To improve the solution convergence, the geometrical constraint given by the well known “epipolar line” (in the second image) is employed. This line comes out from the so-called “coplanarity condition” between <b>homologous</b> image <b>points.</b> The epipolar line equation makes possible to analytically define the filter “geometrical state equation”. This is possible since, while usually as “state vector” an unknown dynamic quantity is utilised, a simplest unknown geometric quantity, suitably defined, is now employed. An iterative solution strategy is carried out in recursive steps until the convergence is fulfilled. The implementation/experimentation of the matching model is now in progress, by using MATLAB software, and it is giving well promising numerical results...|$|R

Satellite imagery, with its recently enhanced spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, allows for accurate and reliable detection and characterization of patterns of change. A key factor that dictates the validity and reliability of change detection results {{is the quality of}} image registration. There is a need to develop robust registration procedures for multi-temporal, multi-spectral and/or multi-resolution imagery captured from different sensors to facilitate the change detection process. This paper discusses an approach for automated image registration based on a hierarchical image matching strategy. Following an initial feature point extraction phase, the method uses the similarity of grey levels to find <b>homologous</b> <b>point</b> candidates across the images. A hierarchical image pyramid is used to enhance both the success rate and reliability of matching while reducing the computational complexity.

By a dynamic approach again, a matching model for an image sequence acquired with only one CCD, has been also recently proposed, so self-extracting points for relative orientation. In this way, the flow chart for the dynamic analysis of these image sequences only involves, as user’s actions, the point collimation in the first image portraying it.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} the {{progress}} in algorithms optimization has resulted in many solutions {{in the area of}} fully automatic reconstructing of 3 D model of any object from a sequence of non-metric images. An important step in the formation of a 3 D model is so-called matching process of <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> in the sequence of images. This stage is still a bottleneck for the reconstruction of objects consisting of uniform surfaces, such as sculptures, reliefs, or even the human body. The solution may be to apply an artificial variety to surfaces by covering them with a random texture pattern. A wide range of multimedia projectors, with increasingly higher resolutions and luminosities, enables us to perform the projection of any texture on the object, and then to register it. In this article, we present the idea of creating an artificial pattern, a structure that will provide significant improvement of automatic point identification stage, and the proper mapping of <b>homologous</b> <b>points</b> in the sequence of images. While creating a pattern allowing easy feature extraction does not present much of a problem, assurance of its uniqueness for the whole object for matching purposes, requires a deliberate idea. Statistical formulation of the problem demonstrates the high efficiency of the method...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{automatic}} geo-referencing of archaeological photographs captured aboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), termed UPs. We do so by help of pre-existing ortho-photo maps (OPMs) and digital surface models (DSMs). Typically, these pre-existing data sets are based on data that were captured at a widely different point in time. This renders the detection (and hence the matching) of <b>homologous</b> feature <b>points</b> in the UPs and OPMs infeasible mainly due to temporal variations of vegetation and illumination. Facing this difficulty, we opt for the normalized cross correlation coefficient of perspectively transformed image patches as the measure of image similarity. Applying a threshold to this measure, we detect candidates for <b>homologous</b> image <b>points,</b> resulting in a distinctive, but computationally intensive method. In order to lower computation times, we reduce the dimensionality and extents of the search space by making use of a priori knowledge of the data sets. By assigning terrain heights interpolated in the DSM to the image points found in the OPM, we generate control points.

To this end, we employ an existing point matching technique and propose a method for line triplet matching in which the relative poses are resolved during the matching procedure.

Rather than randomly choosing the line candidates in the matching process, we generate an associated lookup table to guide the selection of potential line matches.

In order to be able to also work with image sequences the adjustment is formulated in an incremental manner.

While most of the studies available in literature are limited to the evaluation of OSM building completeness, this work proposes an original approach to assess the positional accuracy of OSM buildings based on comparison with a reference dataset. The comparison relies on a quasi-automated detection of homologous pairs on the two datasets.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the seismic {{vulnerability}} of the buildings, one necessary data is the knowledge of façade size and the dimension/position of the windows/doors and other structural discontinuities. To well obtain such information {{for a lot of}} buildings in an urban area, this paper suggests a photogrammetric surveying by the integrated use of Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) techniques and CCD images. As usual for current architectural photogrammetry, by a CCD camera, terrestrial images are acquired in the best geometrical shot conditions. The 2 D-surveying of building façades is then performed by the well-known digital image-rectification procedure. But at this time, the coordinates of the required control points are measured by a low-cost simplified MMS and not, as usual, by topographic methods. Therefore, for this application, we employ a MMS as well as a “ 3 D-point sower”, namely to only measure with the best efficiency the 3 D-coordinates of stacks of control points. From these East, North and Height coordinates, to compute the 2 D-coordinates ones, with respect each single front, is very easy. By using a simplified MMS, original “pseudo-dynamic” analytical models have been proposed and tested during last years. Thanks to these algorithms, it is possible to recursively solve two classical MMS problems as well as the external orientation of its CCD and the <b>homologous</b> <b>point</b> research by image matching.

Surveys are accomplished with the so-called I-MAGE process (Image processing and Measure Assisted by Geometrical primitive) which enables the user, for instance, to obtain 3 -D measurements while digitising a single image with "no loss " of accuracy. I-MAGE is a new measuring method for digitising 3 -D points, based on the coupling of image correlation and the expected shape of objects.
