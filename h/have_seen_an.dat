5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> unexpected attack on Bannerman Road, from an unknown alien species. Sarah Jane would have disappeared along with several other residents. It would have been left to Clyde, Rani and Luke to stop the Alien.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of recent}} immigration, the Roman Catholic Church <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> small growth in adherents, {{while the other}} Christian groups <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> decrease.|$|R
50|$|The station <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> gradual {{increase}} in listenership according to Numeris ratings. At the same time, CHFX <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> drop in ratings.|$|R
50|$|The Pakistani film industry, centred {{historically}} in Lahore, <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> rise in Punjabi movies lately. Urdu languages <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> surge throughout Pakistan specifically Karachi, {{with new}} age films, {{and to a}} lesser extent in Islamabad and Lahore.|$|R
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E
5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> increase {{in the use of}} microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying {{in recent years has been}} in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E
50|$|The {{aftermath}} of the tsunami <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> cessation {{of much of the}} conflict in the city and province, and domestic and international aid as <b>a</b> result <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> major modernisation and reconstruction of the city over the past decade.|$|R
50|$|Tigre <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{influx of}} people {{relocating}} {{to the city}} {{from other parts of}} Greater Buenos Aires. In recent years, it <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> rise in upmarket tourism, spawning new spa developments and clientele such as the pop star, Madonna.|$|R
50|$|In June 1954, Booie hit {{the news}} after local boys claimed to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> two-legged monster in a cave. Despite searching by {{experienced}} bushman, the monster {{was not found}} and it was speculated that the boys <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> large kangaroo.|$|R
5|$|The {{projector}} {{could be}} controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures. By the mid-1970s, automation features were added, {{which led to the}} creation of prerecorded shows. Most visitors to the facility would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> automated 40- to 45-minute audio/visual show on a particular space-related topic. Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis: one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults. Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel, the mythical stories behind the constellations, and around Christmas-time, a show that investigated theories on stellar explanations for the Star of Bethlehem. A listing from 1970 includes shows titled The Story of Eclipses, which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance, Man and the Zodiac which explored the history of mythology and astrology with regard to the night sky, and The Planet Venus which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology, the planet's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi was laying mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E
25|$|Recent years <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} of horn theft from railroad property.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I!" [...] {{cried the}} young midshipman, laughing; [...] "then I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> little clipper, in disguise, out sail an old man-of-war's {{man in a}} hard chase, and I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> straggling rover in long-togs as much like my cousin----" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1996 Knighton was {{publicly}} mocked {{over his}} claims to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> UFO. He {{claimed that he}} and his wife Rosemary <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> UFO in 1976. The local newspaper, the Evening News and Star, broke the story with the headline 'Knighton: Aliens Spoke To Me'.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1882 as a Polish parish, it {{remained}} a parish for Polish {{workers in the}} Union Stockyards until the yards closed in the early 1970s. In recent years the neighborhood <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> growth in new housing and <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> influx of new residents of many backgrounds and cultures.|$|R
25|$|Heironimus's {{relatives}} (his mother Opal and nephew John Miller) {{claim to}} <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> ape suit in Heironimus' car. Opal said {{she saw the}} suit {{two days after the}} film was shot.|$|E
25|$|Other {{parts of}} the world <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the World Literacy Foundation and International Literacy Foundation, as well as a general push for increased global communication.|$|E
25|$|The segment {{was finally}} {{uploaded}} to YouTube and Adult Swim's official website on January 22, 2013. The released segment is censored, however, a forum post was {{made before the}} release by someone claiming to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> uncensored version of the segment at the San Diego Comic-Con.|$|E
50|$|In {{both its}} incarnations, Mid Ulster <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> {{precarious}} balance between unionist and Irish nationalist voters, although {{in recent years}} the nationalists have advanced significantly to be in a clear majority. Many elections <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> candidate from one side triumph due to candidates from the other side splitting the vote.|$|R

25|$|On {{homecoming}} in Tuscaloosa, Alabama defeated coach Robert Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers 18–6 before {{what was}} then the largest crowd to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> Alabama game in Tuscaloosa. The loss was Tennessee's first in 34 games, dating back to a 20–3 loss to Vanderbilt during the 1926 season.|$|E
25|$|Although Cumbric, in the north-west, {{seems to}} have died during the {{eleventh}} century, Cornish continued to thrive until the early modern period, retreating at only around 10km per century. But from about 1500, Cornish-English bilingualism became increasingly common, and Cornish retreated at more like 30km per century. Cornish fell out of use entirely during the eighteenth century, though {{the last few decades}} <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> attempted revival.|$|E
25|$|Between the 2000 and 2010 Census counts, {{the urban}} core of Kansas City {{continued}} to drop significantly in population. The areas of Greater Downtown {{in the center}} city, and sections near I-435 and I-470 in the south, and Highway 152 in the north are the only areas of Kansas City, Missouri, to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> increase in population, with the Northland seeing the greatest population growth.|$|E

25|$|Crop {{productivity}} may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{increase at}} San José Mogote {{due to the}} initiation of two simple irrigation techniques: Pot irrigation and Irrigation ditches. Pot irrigation involved digging many shallow wells in order to accumulate water, and then scooping up that water to use on surrounding plants. Irrigation ditches were small-scale systems used to tap into streams {{in order to allow}} water to flow over the plants.|$|E
25|$|Marriage rates began declining {{from almost}} 71 per 1,000 {{inhabitants}} in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004. Moreover, divorce rates <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004. As {{a result of}} these trends, the average Greek household is smaller and older than in previous generations.|$|E
25|$|Recent years <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{increased}} interest in energy consumption reduction based on behavioural change, be it for reasons of climate change mitigation or energy security. The application of behavioural change theories {{in the field of}} energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights. For example, it supports criticism of a too narrow focus on individual behaviour and a broadening to include social interaction, lifestyles, norms and values as well as technologies and policies—all enabling or constraining behavioural change.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{popularity of}} pleasure boating in the United Kingdom, the harbour <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> {{rapid increase in}} the private ownership of pleasure vessels over the past decade, {{most of which are}} housed in private marinas around the harbour. Due to this increase, Poole <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> {{rise in the number of}} maritime-oriented businesses.|$|R
