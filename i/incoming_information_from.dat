By analogy to similar {{parts of the brain}} such as the retina, many researchers have focused on how the olfactory bulb filters <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> receptor neurons in space, or how it filters incoming information in time. At the core of these proposed filters are the two classes of interneurons; the periglomerular cells, and the granule cells. Processing occurs at each level of the main olfactory bulb, beginning with the spatial maps that categorize odors in the glomeruli layer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prototype}} representation approach {{stems from}} theories {{developed in the}} linguistics and cognitive psychology domains. It proposes that there are “prototypes” (i.e., internal representations) stored in the brain, which <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> the senses is compared against to facilitate categorisation. Therefore, the own-accent bias {{is due to the}} fact that own-accents are similar to the prototype of [...] "accent" [...] hence are processed and categorised more easily than those other-accents that are dissimilar. This idea is supported by research showing that the further away a voice is from the average, (which is assumed to be a good representation of the internal prototype of accent) the more distinctive and less attractive it is rated, and the more activity is produced in the temporal voice areas (areas of the brain that deal with voice perception and accents).|$|E

50|$|The {{somatosensory}} cortex encodes <b>incoming</b> sensory <b>information</b> <b>from</b> receptors {{all over the}} body. Affective touch {{is a type of}} sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary {{somatosensory cortex}}, but the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood oxygen level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.|$|R

Although recent evidence emphasizes the fundamental role of prior knowledge for perceptual decision making, only few studies have quantified the relevance of such priors on perceptual decisions and examined their interplay with other decision-relevant factors, such as the stimulus properties. In the present study we asked whether hysteresis, describing the stability of a percept despite a change in stimulus property and known to occur at perceptual thresholds, also acts {{as a form of}} an implicit prior in tactile spatial decision making, supporting the stability of a decision across successively presented random stimuli (i. e., decision hysteresis). We applied a variant of the classical 2 -point discrimination task and found that hysteresis influenced perceptual decision making: Participants were more likely to decide ‘same ’ rather than ‘different ’ on successively presented pin distances.

Overall, avoiding knives in synchronous human hand condition produced the highest anxiety score while catching coins in asynchronous cat claw had the lowest anxiety score. As in experiment 1, synchronicity and modality significantly affected anxiety, {{and there is no}} relevance to the type of the task. Besides that, the results also revealed that different emotional events influenced stress feelings differently. It was easier to arouse higher anxious feelings in the participants when they were assigned with the task of avoiding knives than when catching coins. That was due to the affective effects of emotional events on stress feelings. The ability of detecting, identifying, and avoiding threats are more important for our survival than gaining awards (Boyer & Bergstrom, 2011; Nairne & Pandeirada, 2016). Moreover, we also found both synchronicity and modality had more influences on punishing than on awarding, which suggested when the condition was taken as not so relevant to themselves, the corresponding anxiety level would substantially descent for threatening than awarding. There was also an interaction among sense of agency, sense of ownership, and emotional events, which fits with the claim that self-perception will be processed hierarchically with multimodal areas processing the confluence of “self” <b>information</b> <b>from</b> different sensory systems and explaining away the surprising <b>incoming</b> sensory <b>information</b> <b>from</b> unimodal areas (Apps & Tsakiris, 2014).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Earthquakes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{unpredictable}} natural hazards but recently short-lead-time Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS) have become practical with a system operating in Japan and another planned for operation in California in the next year or two. A few seconds to a minute or so of early warning is achievable. For example, if appropriate, an early warning can be broadcast to enhance the effectiveness of evacuations, water and gas supplies can be temporarily cut off, and other more advanced engineering applications may also be developed. Due to the limited warning time and the uncertainty of the information from an EEWS, applications that require real-time human decision-making are not practical. This motivates recent research to develop a robust automated rapid decision-making procedure for mitigation actions. A rational procedure is to initiate a potential loss-reduction action if, based on the <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> an EEWS, the expected loss from taking no action is greater than the expected loss from taking the mitigation action. To estimate the expected loss of a predicted event, it is proposed to use the recently developed PEER performance-based earthquake engineering methodology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{experiences}} with Concept Mapping at Langara College, {{a theory of}} information transfer between short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) is proposed. A neuron-network/mathematical model based on Rummelhart's connectionist theory (1989) is proposed as to identify the process in which elements of LTM encode new <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> STM. Information in LTM is viewed in connectionist analogy in which pieces of information are integrated together. Learning is explained via mathematical models presenting changes in connection between incoming STM units and LTM. Relevance (a mathematical/theoretical construct) is proposed as a necessary facilitator for successful integration and accommodation of STM unit(s) by LTM to occur. Each STM information unit must be compatible with its counterpart(s) in LTM in order for successful integration to occur. An STM unit can simultaneously be connected and integrated to descriptive, semantic and declarative memories or episodic memories. More "connections " between the STM unit and different types of memories in LTM increases speed and efficiency of recall.

40|$|Diminished {{connectivity}} between midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei and {{prefrontal cortex}} {{has been suggested}} to contribute to cognitive deficits that are detectable even in early stages of schizophrenia. The midline-intralaminar relay cells comprise the final link in the ascending arousal pathway and are selectively excited by the wake-promoting peptides hypocretin 1 and 2 (orexin A and B). This excitation occurs both {{at the level of}} the relay cell bodies and their axon terminals within prefrontal cortex. In rat brain slices, the release of glutamate from midline-intralaminar thalamocortical terminals induces excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer V pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex. When hypocretin is infused into medial prefrontal cortex of behaving animals, it improves performance in a complex cognitive task requiring divided attention. Chronic restraint stress causes atrophy of the apical dendritic arbors in layer V prefrontal pyramidal cells and leads to a reduction in hypocretin-induced EPSCs, indicating impairment in excitatory thalamocortical transmission. Thus, taken together with evidence for an underlying loss of excitatory thalamocortical connectivity in schizophrenia, stress in this illness could further exacerbate a breakdown in cortical processing of <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> the ascending arousal system.
