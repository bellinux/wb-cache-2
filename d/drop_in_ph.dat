25|$|PA is endocytosed as a soluble heptamer {{attached}} to its receptors, with LF or EF {{attached to}} the heptamer as cargo. The first step after endocytosis is the acidification of the endocytotic vesicle. The acidification plays two roles in the lifespan of the toxin. First, it helps to relax the tight grip of the CMG2 or TEM8 receptor on PA, facilitating the pore formation (the different receptors allow for insertion at a slightly different pH). Second, the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> causes a disordered loop and a Greek-key motif in the PA domain 2 to fold out of the heptamer pre-pore and insert through {{the wall of the}} acidic vesicle, leading to pore formation (Figures 7–9).|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the β-barrel pore is facilitated with a <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH.</b> To form the barrel when the pH drops, PA63 domain 2 must undergo the greatest conformation change. Upon examination {{of the structure of}} domain 2 (Fig. 7), one can see that this domain contains a Greek-key motif (the gold portion in Fig. 7). A general schematic of a Greek-key motif is shown in Fig. 8. Attached to the Greek-key in domain 2 is a large disordered loop. The necessity of this loop in pore formation is shown through using mutagenesis and proteolysis of the loop with chymotrypsin. Additional electrophysiological measurements of cysteine substitutions place the amino acids of this loop inside the lumen of the membrane inserted pore. The disordered loop in domain 2 also has a pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, which is a pattern conserved in the membrane-spanning portions of porins. The only problem is that the loop is not large enough to span a membrane in a β-barrel. This membrane insertion could only occur with additional conformational changes. A large conformational change takes place where the Greek-key motif unfolds, forming a β-hairpin that projects downward into the membrane and forms a β-barrel with the other 6 monomers of the complex (figures 9a and 9b). The final pore has a diameter of 12 Å (1.2nm), which fits the theoretical value of this model.|$|E

The reason for the time limit of voluntary apnea is that the rate of breathing and the volume of each breath are tightly regulated to maintain constant values of CO2 tension and pH of the blood. In apnea, CO2 is not removed through the lungs and accumulates in the blood. The consequent rise in CO2 tension and <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> result in stimulation of the respiratory centre in the brain which eventually cannot be overcome voluntarily.|$|E

50|$|The {{source of}} the river's {{distinctive}} turquoise color is not a due to a chemical species but to a physical phenomenon known as Mie scattering. Celeste River is fed by two colorless rivers, the Buenavista River and Sour Creek. Buenavista River carries a large concentration of aluminosilicate particles with a small diameter. Sour Creek, as its name implies, has a high acidity due to volcanic activity. When these two streams mix to form Celeste River, the <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> causes the aluminosilicate particles to aggregate and enlarge to a diameter of about 566 nm. These suspended particles produce Mie scattering which gives the river a strong turquoise color.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the cream}} is inoculated with starter {{bacteria}} and the bacteria begins converting lactose to lactic acid, the pH begins a slow decrease. When this decrease begins, dissolution of calcium phosphate occurs, and causes a rapid {{drop in the}} pH. During the processing step fermentation the pH was dropped from 6.5 to 4.6, this <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> brings on a physicochemical change to the casein micelles. Recall the casein proteins are heat stable, {{but they are not}} stable in certain acidic conditions. The colloidal particles are stable at the normal pH of milk which is 6.5-6.7, the micelles will precipitate at the isoelectric point of milk which is a pH of 4.6. At a pH of 6.5 the casein micelles repulse each other due to the electronegativity of the outer layer of the micelle. During this <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> there is a reduction in zeta potential, from the highly net negative charges in cream to no net charge when approaching the PI. [...] The formula shown is the Henry's equation, where z: zeta potential, Ue: electrophoretic mobility, ε: dielectric constant, η: viscosity, and f(Ka): Henry's function. This equation is used to find the zeta potential, which is calculated to find the Electrokinetic potential in colloidal dispersion's. Through electrostatic interactions the casein molecules begin approaching and aggregating together. The casein proteins enter a more ordered system, attributing to a strong gel structure formation. The whey proteins that were denatured in the heating steps of processing, are insoluble at this acidic pH and are precipitated with casein.|$|E

50|$|Glass ionomer cement is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} prevention of dental caries. This dental material has good adhesive bond properties to tooth structure, allowing it to form a tight seal between the internal structures of the tooth and the surrounding environment. Dental caries is caused by bacterial production of acid during their metabolic actions. The acid produced from this metabolism results in the breakdown of tooth enamel and subsequent inner structures of the tooth, if the disease is not intervened by a dental professional, or if the carious lesion does not arrest and/or the enamel re-mineralises by itself. Glass ionomer cements act as sealants when pits and fissures in the tooth occur and release fluoride to prevent further enamel demineralisation and promote remineralisation. Fluoride can also hinder bacterial growth, by inhibiting their metabolism of ingested sugars in the diet. It does this by inhibiting various metabolic enzymes within the bacteria. This leads to a reduction in the acid produced during the bacteria’s digestion of food, preventing a further <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and therefore preventing carious.|$|E

The slow time course of lactic acid release into the blood permits temporal separation of the peak metabolic acidosis from the peak respiratory acidosis.

A total of 210 specimens were used and the experiment was conducted in replicates. It was observed that the salinity induced pH changes affect the calcification of foraminifera. However the response is not linear.

Specimens kept at 10 and 15 &permil; (pH 7. 2 and 7. 5, respectively) became opaque within two days of lowering the salinity and later on their tests dissolved within 24 and 43 days, respectively. Besides calcification capability, pH also affects reproduction. No specimen reproduced at 10 and 15 &permil; salinity while only a few specimens (3 %) reproduced at 20 &permil;.

40|$|To {{be able to}} use algae in {{industrial}} production, especially of biofuels, the cultivation procedures need to be improved in terms of efficiency and minimization of production costs. One important factor is to reach as high biomass concentrations as possible e. g. by using high levels of carbon dioxide provided by flue gas. The aim of this project was to study the influence of flue gas simulated to mimic effluents of pulp mills on growth and cellular composition of microalgae. Ten strains of fresh water species and one marine were selected based on reported fast growth and interesting composition such as high levels of lipids. The algae were screened in cultivations with fresh water mineral medium and artificially produced flue gas bubbled into the cultures consisting of 15 % CO 2 with 100 ppm NO and 10 ppm SO 2 included for the last period of the cultivations. All strains tested were able to grow and two Scenedesmus strains, an isolated strain from a nearby lake, Chorella protothecoides and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibited the highest specific growth rates. The highest levels of cellular macromolecules were found in Chlorella emersonii (45 % of carbohydrates), Nannochloropsis salina and the local isolate (65 % of proteins), and Botrycoccus braunii (57 % of lipids). It can be concluded that all strains tested were able to grow in cultures with flue gas as carbon source, also the marine species Nannochloropsis salina, and that the gaseous components decrease pH which needs to be monitored carefully to avoid that large <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> inhibit algal growth...|$|R
