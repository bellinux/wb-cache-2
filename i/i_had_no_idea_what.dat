While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{was seen}} by ABC executives, in her Broadway {{performance}} of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, and she chose Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> I was looking for." [...] Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after she met her. Ramirez's character was initially given recurring status in the second season and received star billing in the third season, alongside fellow cast member Dane, who portrayed Mark Sloan.

500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three {{nights in a row}} because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{her success}} on Broadway, Ramirez joined {{the cast of}} Grey's Anatomy in a {{recurring}} role as Dr. Calliope 'Callie' Torres, a love interest for Dr. George O'Malley, in the show's second season. On a special Grey's Anatomy-themed episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, she revealed that top executives from ABC, who were greatly impressed by her performance in Spamalot, offered her a role in any ABC show she wanted. She picked Grey's, as she was already {{a fan of the}} show. [...] Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare.

500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was in store there {{in terms of the}} remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E

500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "In Yo Face" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Pie in Yo Face", {{but it was}} decided that the final title sounded better. [...] "The Bone" [...] features surf rock-influenced guitars. According to Bruce, [...] "Mike's beat for this was so fuckin' crazy sounding <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the fuck to do with it." [...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. The only reason I don’t do it is because I'd probably get caught. So its nice to live it out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E

2500|$|On June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said {{negotiations}} for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight {{were close to}} being finalized.

[...] "These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated," [...] he commented. [...] "Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close." [...] A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer refuted De La Hoya's comments.

Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend.

I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music {{in the same way}} — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E

[...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.
