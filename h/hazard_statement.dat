40|$|International audienceA {{stepwise}} method for {{assessment of the}} HP 12 is proposed and tested with 49 waste samples. The hazard property HP 12 is defined as “Release of an acute toxic gas”: waste which releases acute toxic gases (Acute Tox. 1, 2 or 3) in contact with water or an acid. When a waste contains a substance {{assigned to one of}} the following supplemental hazards EUH 029, EUH 031 and EUH 032, it shall be classified as hazardous by HP 12 according to test methods or guidelines (EC, 2014 a, 2014 b). When the substances with the cited <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> codes react with water or an acid, they can release HCl, Cl 2, HF, HCN, PH 3, H 2 S, SO 2 (and two other gases very unlikely to be emitted, hydrazoic acid HN 3 and selenium oxide SeO 2 – a solid with low vapor pressure). Hence, a method is proposed : - 1. Measurement of the volume of gases emitted into contact with water or an acid (solid/liquid ratio of 10 L water or acid/kg raw waste, acid 2. 5 M HNO 3). - 2. If gas is emitted at a rate higher than 0. 1 L of gas/kg waste in 5 min (limit of quantification of the automated calcimètre used here), checking if one of the cited gases is emitted with electrochemical detection probes or simple qualitative colorimetric methods. - 3. If one of these gases is detected, speciation of the emitting substance(s) (calculation by the “worst case” method from elements concentrations, or by specific analytic methods) and checking whether they have a <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> code EUH 029, EUH 031 or EUH 032 (a list is provided). For a set of 49 waste, water addition did not produce gas. Nearly all the solid waste produced a gas in contact with hydrochloric acid in 5 min in an automated calcimeter with a volume > 0. 1 L of gas per kg of waste. Since a plateau of pressure is reached only for half of the samples in 5 min, 6 h trial with calorimetric bombs or glass flasks were done and confirmed the results. Identification of the gases by portable probes showed that most of the tested samples emit mainly CO 2. Toxic gases are emitted by four waste: metallic dust from the aluminum industry (CO), two air pollution control residue of industrial waste incinerator (H 2 S) and a halogenated solvent (organic volatile(s) compound(s)). HF has not been measured in these trials started before the present definition of HP 12. According to the definition of HP 12, only the H 2 S emission of substances with <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> EUH 031 is accounted for. In view of the calcium content of the two air pollution control residue, the presence of calcium sulphide (EUH 031) can be assumed. These two waste are therefore classified potentially hazardous for HP 12, from a total of 49 waste. They are also classified as hazardous for other properties (HP 7, 10 and 14 for one of them, and HP 10 and 14 for the other one respectively). Given these results, it can be assumed that few common household and industrial waste will be classified hazardous only by HP 12...|$|E
30|$|Construction {{products}} are usually complex mixtures containing many more chemicals than {{included on the}} list of priority substances: residues from the production process and additives such as plasticizers, stabilization agents, pigments, surfactants, and solvents. In addition, the transformation of substances during the service life can result in as yet unknown substances and will be an important task for non-targeted analysis and fundamental research. Identifying relevant substances leaching from the materials is, therefore, quite a challenge. Usually, the process is a stepwise approach and depends on the information available. The formulation of the product, if it is available, is a good starting point for substance identification. This compound list can be checked for substances that are classified as environmental hazards in accordance with the globally harmonized system of classifying and labeling chemicals [49] or those included in the indicative list [50]. Especially substances with a high acute toxicity (<b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> H 400) and with long-lasting effects (H 410, H 411) are of concern. Knowledge of the presence of potential dangerous substances alone is not sufficient information, as total content is a poor indicator of the leaching potential and the resulting concentrations in the eluates. Furthermore, dangerous substances in the bulk material {{do not have to be}} reported if the concentrations are below reporting thresholds.|$|E
50|$|Current {{training}} {{procedures for}} Hazard Communication in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.

Employees and emergency responders will need to be trained on all new program elements, from <b>hazard</b> <b>statements</b> to pictograms.

40|$|AbstractThe safety {{data sheet}} (SDS), {{formerly}} known in the United States as the material {{safety data sheet}} (MSDS), contains important information for the safe handling of chemicals. This manuscript will cover the use of safety data sheets for process design and safe handling of chemicals. Three main categories (flammability, physical properties, and toxicity) listed in a SDS will be explained. Within each category, examples will be presented on how the specific information can be used in the design of safe chemical operations. Further, within the United States, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised their hazard communication standard in March of 2012. Specifically, the standard has been aligned with the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Changes include requirements for use of standardized signal words, pictograms, <b>hazard</b> <b>statements,</b> and precautionary statements. The presentation will review examples of these important changes, and relating these to the GHS for safe use of chemicals within the workplace worldwide...|$|R

30|$|Whereas the {{toxicity}} of dispersions {{can only be}} expressed {{on the basis of}} nominal concentrations, {{the toxicity}} of filtrates can be expressed in terms of either nominal or analytical concentrations. Therefore, the toxicity results for the small TiO 2 particles varied from no toxicity at all, to EC 20 values of several mg/L (dispersions or filtrates expressed as nominal concentrations) to EC 20 values of several µg/L (filtrates expressed as analytical concentrations). Effect concentrations are used to trigger <b>hazard</b> <b>statements,</b> and according to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, not readily biodegradable substances with a low solubility in water (≤ 1  mg/L) and a log Kow ≤  3 are classified as harmful for the aquatic environment if the ErC/LC 50 is between 10 and 100  mg/L. If the ErC/LC 50 is below 1  mg/L they are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. Therefore, the conclusions drawn with respect to the toxicity of nanomaterials and the resulting consequences will differ depending on whether total concentrations from dispersion testing or concentrations in filtrates are used to calculate toxicity indicators. Because information on the toxic fraction of dispersed nanomaterials is still limited, nominal concentrations currently appear to be more suitable for effect characterization. This may be revised, and recalculation of the toxicity may be possible, when more information about the toxic fractions of nanomaterials becomes available. We recommend that short-term dispersion procedures are used to characterize the aquatic ecotoxicity of nanomaterials, since long-term stirring appears unsuitable and inappropriate for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFR), {{including}} tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) represents 25 % {{of the global}} market of flame retardants. Among them, TBBPA is used on the largest scale (approx. 60 %) because of its firebreak properties and widespread occurrence in every day products such as furniture, upholstery, adhesives and electronic equipment. A broad application of TBBPA can contribute to environmental pollution. Tetrabromobisphenol A has been determined in soil, water, river sediments and the atmosphere. Tetrabromobisphenol A {{is characterized by a}} high value of coefficient n-octanol/water (log P = 4. 5), low acidity, and it may exist in undissociated or dissociated form. Due to the high hydrophobicity, TBBPA may accumulate in living organisms, including humans at different food chain levels. The occurrence of TBBPA in humans, e. g., in blood, fat tissue and mother milk, has been reported. Tetrabromobisphenol A is classified as <b>hazard</b> <b>statements</b> (H) H 400 /H 410, which means that it is toxic to aquatic biota, causing long-term changes in these organisms. Up to now, only a few studies have been conducted to assess potential toxicity of high doses of TBBPA to mammals. Although many people are occupationally exposed to TBBPA during production or processing of this substance in their workplaces, {{there are only a few}} studies that have assessed the real hazard associated with TBPPA exposure. The aim of the study was to discuss the latest literature (mainly from the years 2010 – 2016) referring to the presence of TBBPA in the environment and its effects to living organisms.

30|$|Adding pictograms, {{icons and}} symbols to PCP labels is another {{recommended}} addition. Comprehensibility testing of potential pictograms, however, {{should be conducted}} before any pictograms are legislated for use. For example, the GHS pictograms were not subjected to global comprehensibility testing prior {{to the development of}} the first purple book. Comprehensibility testing, based on the University of Cape Town’s testing methodology, took place too late [82] as there was no option for changing or adapting these pictograms. The GHS building block approach does, however, allow for countries to add additional pictograms that are relevant for the country context [5]. We do not recommend introducing more pictograms with a global scope since pictograms are not cross-culturally transferable or intuitively obvious [69]. Research has shown that pictograms are not clearly understood by consumers - especially the GHS pictogram for acute toxicity (Figure  1 a) [4]. We recommend that a mechanism be put in place for countries to evaluate and upgrade legally binding pictograms to improve RC. We therefore support the plan proposed by ECHA to perform a new analysis by 2015 before mixtures will have to be labeled with the new GHS pictograms [66]. The question of cross-cultural comprehension of pictograms as scientifically intended is illustrated by whether these are understood in the same way by an illiterate South African farm worker as by a Finnish professor. Importantly, misinterpretations of label information can even increase the health risk [69]. To reduce misinterpretations, we recommend clear <b>hazard</b> <b>statements</b> on the label with precautionary advice. We also recommend that any pictograms or icons used on labels have the meaning printed in clear and concise words underneath.|$|R
