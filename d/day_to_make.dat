5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to the grocery store where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E

The Australians then scored 313 at almost double the rate, with play ending early {{on the second day}} due to rain, before Saunders took six for nine to bowl Surrey out for 111. However, as the Australians had to travel to Manchester for the Fourth Test, they did not attempt to chase 95 for victory.|$|E

His underground prison {{was known as the}} 'chamber of truth', and most of Paraguay's manufactures were made with prison labour. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo ("stool") under an orange tree outside his window. So as not to waste bullets, most victims were bayoneted, while their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all <b>day,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure they were dead.|$|E

The Australians lost their first five wickets for 137, but Darling, batting at number five, made the Australians' first hundred of the tour. His innings of five hours lasted into the third day. The seventh-wicket stand with Bert Hopkins was worth 131 runs, and the eighth-wicket stand with wicketkeeper Jim Kelly a further 119. The Australians made 474, before Warwick Armstrong took career-best figures of eight for 47 as the hosts were bowled out for 183 to secure the Australians' first win on tour.|$|E

Debutante Enid Bakewell, aged 28, made a hundred {{in the first}} Test, but Australia declared 69 ahead, and England batted out the third <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 192 for seven; in the second Test Edna Barker registered a hundred, and England set a target of 181, but could only take five wickets for 108 in Australia's final innings. The decider at Sydney also saw a declaration, from Australia, who made 210 for three declared in their second innings, but England lost only six wickets in the chase to draw again.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down protein. This {{releases}} alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon {{is responsible for the}} wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2–3 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.|$|E

He worked as a shoe salesman at a sporting goods store during the <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ends meet and continued playing gigs in Little Rock and Fayetteville at night. In 2007, Allen wrote and self-produced an album entitled Brand New Shoes with college friends and bandmates Michael Holmes (drums) and Chase Erwin (bass).

25|$|England won {{the first}} Test by a convincing ten wicket margin after Bedser took 11 wickets on debut and Hardstaff scored 205 not out. On {{each of the first}} two days the gates were closed about noon, when the crowds {{numbered}} nearly 30,000. Around 15,000 were present on the third day, on which the match finished at half past one. India won the toss and batted first but, with heavy rain having fallen, this proved anything but an advantage as the ground was wet throughout the first <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> run-scoring difficult. With the weather improving on the day {{prior to the start of}} the Test, the MCC predicted a start in accordance to the scheduled time of 11:30. Wisden says that Bedser maintained an admirable length at fast-medium pace, using swerve or spin to turn the ball appreciably from the sodden turf. Hardstaff's innings was one of great concentration and gave him his highest score in Test cricket after five and a quarter hours batting. He had great support from Gibb in a stand of 182 for the fifth wicket and some useful tailend contributions, especially by Smailes. India began the third day only 66 behind with six wickets in hand but Bedser and Wright caused a collapse which left England needing only 48 to win.|$|E

500|$|Everton {{and makeup}} {{designers}} Michael Westmore, Scott Wheeler, and Jake Garber wanted {{to upgrade the}} pasty white look the Borg had retained since The Next Generations second season, born out of a need for budget-conscious television design. [...] "I wanted it to look like they were [...] {{from the inside out}} rather than the outside in," [...] Everton said. Each Borg had a slightly different design, and Westmore designed a new one each <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it appear that there was an army of Borg; in reality, between eight and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce. Background Borg were simulated by half-finished mannequins. Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had traveled the galaxy, they would have assimilated other races besides humans. In the television series, much of the Borg's faces had been covered by helmets, but for First Contact the makeup artist removed the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar Star Trek aliens such as Klingons, Bolians, Romulans, Bajorans, and Cardassians. Each drone received an electronic eyepiece. The blinking lights in each eye were programmed by Westmore's son to repeat a production member's name in Morse code.|$|E

On the next day, Darwin was in [...] "transports of pleasure" [...] walking by himself in the tropical forest, and in [...] "long naturalizing walks" [...] with others continued to [...] "add raptures to the former raptures". He found the sights of slavery offensive and when FitzRoy defended the practice by describing {{a visit to a}} slaveowner whose slaves replied [...] "no" [...] on being asked by their master if they wished to be freed, Darwin suggested that answers in such circumstances were worthless. Enraged that his word had been questioned, FitzRoy lost his temper and banned Darwin from his company. The officers had nicknamed such outbursts [...] "hot coffee," [...] and within hours FitzRoy apologised and asked Darwin to remain. Later, FitzRoy had to remain silent when Captain Paget visited them and recounted [...] "facts about slavery so revolting" [...] that refuted his claim.|$|E
500|$|The Salford to Warrington turnpike trust {{was formed}} in 1752 and assumed control of the road from Pendleton to Irlam. Opinions as {{to the quality of}} the road were mainly negative; writing in 1795, John Aikin said [...] "Much Labour and a very great expense of money have been {{expended}} on the roads of this parish, but they still remain in a very indifferent state, and from one plain and obvious cause, the immoderate weights drawn in carts and waggons." [...] On the poor quality roads, the Liverpool to Manchester stagecoach took almost an entire <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the journey. Matters appear to have improved by the 19th century, along with the opening of several more trust roads throughout the parish. In the early part of the 19th century some existing routes were widened and straightened, including the modern-day Regent Road in Salford. [...] All the roads except one were surfaced with boulders. In 1832 a daily omnibus service from Manchester reached Eccles and Pendleton. In 1877, following the laying of tracks in the road, horse-drawn trams were used; these eventually gave way in 1902 to electric trams under the control of the Salford Corporation. Motorised buses were introduced in 1938.|$|E
