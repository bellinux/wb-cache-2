[...] Jill Mader of Inside Pulse also gave the episode a {{more positive}} review, praising [...] "that the episode ended with a really sweet moment for Howard as, after all, he is a character who doesn't often get to be sweet" [...] and claimed that it was [...] "definitely about people changing and moving forward, and The Big Bang Theory <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of emotionally maturing many of their characters {{over the past couple}} seasons". Despite this, she said that [...] "the episode wasn't as [...] as [...] hoped it would be" [...] and [...] "felt like there was more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's [...] "little speech" [...] as [...] "very well written and performed". However, he considered most of the comedy [...] "generic", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard. Overall, Pierson said it [...] "wasn't the strongest episode of comedy" [...] and [...] "wasn't a particularly interesting episode until the end".|$|E

2500|$|For his own part, Zhirinovsky <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal {{to foster}} a {{reputation}} as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear. Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available. Zhirinovsky has on several occasions become involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, he also took part in the 2000 and 2008 presidential elections, promising a [...] "police state", and to institute summary executions. A BBC documentary from 1995 showed Zhirinovsky telling the crowd at a campaign rally: [...] "Help us, and you'll never have to vote again! I'm not saying, [...] "Vote for us and maybe in 20 years' time somebody will do something". No, these will be the last elections! The last ones!". Some commentators call Zhirinovsky a fascist or a neo-fascist.|$|E

2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job with the character, she did not feel {{she had to get}} to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E

It's an emotionally exhausting show to do." [...] On 2 May 2007, {{it was announced that}} Ben Shephard had quit his role as presenter of spin-off show The Xtra Factor on ITV2. Shephard was reportedly not happy that O'Leary was given the role as presenter of the main show instead of him. An X Factor insider said: [...] "Ben had a big chance of being the main presenter on X Factor until he did Soapstar Superstar last year on ITV1. He didn't impress some of the X Factor bosses on that live show and moved down the pecking order." [...] Cowell said: [...] "I wish Ben good luck. He <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job on The Xtra Factor." [...] Shephard later signed up to front DanceX, a BBC One series hunting for a modern-day version of '70s dance outfit Hot Gossip. He was replaced by Top of the Pops presenter and BBC Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and now I have to go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm still young and I've got big things to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper {{scored the}} PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "certainly the best {{version of the}} bunch." [...] Of the controls, he wrote [...] "it doesn't feel as {{rewarding}} or [...] "realistic" [...] as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does." [...] He was also critical of the graphics; [...] "its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen {{and it really does}} look like you're playing a PS2 game in HD." [...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect." [...] Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same." [...] He concluded [...] "The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kaiser Family Foundation, a {{non-governmental}} organization that evaluated Cuba’s healthcare system in 2000-1 described Cuba as [...] "a shining {{example of the}} power of public health to transform the health of an entire country by a commitment to prevention and by careful management of its medical resources" [...] President of the World Bank James Wolfensohn also praised Cuba's healthcare system in 2001, saying that [...] "Cuba <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job on education and health", {{at the annual meeting of}} the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Wayne Smith, former head of the US Interests Section in Havana identified [...] "the incredible dedication" [...] of Cubans to healthcare, adding that [...] "Doctors in Cuba can make more driving cabs and working in hotels, but they don't. They're just very dedicated". Dr. Robert N. Butler, who was president of the International Longevity Center in New York and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author on aging, traveled to Cuba to see firsthand how doctors were trained. He said a principal reason that some health standards in Cuba approach the high American level is that the Cuban system emphasizes early intervention. Clinic visits are free, and the focus is on preventing disease rather than treating it. [...] Furthermore, London's The Guardian newspaper lauded Cuba's public healthcare system for what it viewed as its high quality in a September 12, 2007 article.|$|E
2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of you out there who just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E
