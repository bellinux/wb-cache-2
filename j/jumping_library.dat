50|$|This library {{construction}} process is also {{similar to that}} of Short-jump library except that transfection using the E. coli vector is required for amplification of large (40 kb) DNA fragments. In addition, the Fosmids can be modified to facilitate the conversion into <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> compatible with certain Next Generation Sequencers.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, Zabarovsky et al. {{proposed}} {{a new approach}} for construction of jumping libraries. This approach included the use of two separate λ vectors for library construction, and a partial filling-in reaction that removes {{the need for a}} selectable marker. This filling-in reaction worked by destroying the specific cohesive ends (resulting from restriction digests) of the DNA fragments that were nonligated and noncircularized, thus preventing them from cloning into the vectors, in a more energy-efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, this improved technique required less DNA to start with, and also produced a library that could be transferred into a plasmid form, making it easier to store and replicate. Using this new approach, they successfully constructed a human NotI <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> from a lymphoblastoid cell line and a human chromosome 3-specific NotI <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> from a human chromosome 3 and mouse hybrid cell line.|$|E
50|$|A <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> NGS {{combined}} {{approach can be}} applied to identify such genomic changes. For example, Slade et al. applied this method to fine map a de novo balanced translocation in a child with Wilms' tumor. For this study, 50 million reads were generated, but only 11.6% of these could be mapped uniquely to the reference genome, which represents approximately a sixfold coverage.|$|E
5000|$|A {{library is}} often {{prepared}} by random fragmentation of DNA and ligation of common adaptor sequences. However, the generated short reads challenge {{the identification of}} structural variants, such as indels, translocations, and duplication. Large regions of simple repeats can further complicate the alignment. Alternatively, <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> {{can be used with}} NGS for the mapping of structural variation and scaffolding of de novo assemblies.|$|E

50|$|Jumping {{libraries}} or junction-fragment libraries are {{collections of}} genomic DNA fragments generated by chromosome jumping. These libraries {{allow us to}} analyze {{large areas of the}} genome and overcome distance limitations in common cloning techniques.A <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> clone is composed of two stretches of DNA that are usually located many kilobases away from each other. The stretch of DNA located between these two “ends” is deleted by a series of biochemical manipulations carried out at the start of this cloning technique.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two issues}} related to Short-jump libraries. First, a read can pass through the {{biotinylated}} circularization junction and reduce the effective read length. Second, reads from non-jumped fragments (i.e. fragments without the circularization junction) are sequenced and reduce genomic coverage. It {{has been reported that}} non-jumped fragments range from 4% to 13%, {{depending on the size of}} selection. The first problem might be solved by shearing circles into a larger size and select for those larger fragments. The second problem can be addressed by using Custom Barcoded <b>Jumping</b> <b>Library.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{segments}} {{resulting from}} circularization during constructing <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> are cleaved, and DNA fragments with markers will be enriched {{and subjected to}} paired-end sequencing. These DNA fragments are sequenced from both ends and generate pairs of reads. The genomic distance between the reads in each pair is approximately known and used for the assembly process.For example, a DNA clone generated by random fragmentation is about 200 bp, and a read from each end is around 180bp, overlapping each other. This should be distinguished from mate-pair sequencing, which is basically a combination of Next Generation Sequencing with jumping libraries.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Illumina’s {{recently}} released Nextera Long Mate Pair (LMP) kit enables production of <b>jumping</b> <b>libraries</b> {{of up to}} 12 kb. LMP libraries are an invaluable resource for carrying out complex assem-blies and other downstream bioinformatics analyses such as the characterization of structural variants. However, LMP libraries are intrinsically noisy {{and in order to}} maximize their value post-sequencing data analysis are required. Indeed, standardising labor-atory protocols and the selection of sequenced reads for down-stream analysis are non-trivial tasks.

40|$|Linking clones contain {{sequences}} flanking recognition {{sites for}} enzymes cutting rarely in mammalian DNA. They {{can be used}} to obtain and correlate both physical and genetic mapping information over subregions of mammalian chromosomes. We have constructed and used a NotI linking clone library representing unmethylated NotI sites from HHW 693 DNA, a hamster hybrid cell line containing 4 p 15 - 4 pter and a fragment of 5 p as its only human chromosome contribution. Human clones were identified by hybridisation with a cloned human repeat sequence, and localised further to subregions of human chromosome 4 p 15 - 4 pter using a panel of additional hybrids. Clones from the region distal to the DNA probes (D 4 S 10, D 4 S 43, D 4 S 95) linked to the Huntington's disease mutation, were further analysed. Four markers close to the HD gene: D 4 S 111, D 4 S 113, D 4 S 114 and clone 417 are described here. In addition to serving as markers in physical and genetic mapping experiments, these linking clones provide probes next to cleavable NotI sites, and can therefore be used to screen NotI based chromosome <b>jumping</b> <b>libraries.</b> They also provide indications for potential gene sequences, identifiable as evolutionarily conserved sequences...|$|R
50|$|Talkowski et al. {{compared}} {{different approaches}} to detect balanced chromosome alterations, and showed that modified <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> in combination with next generation DNA sequencing is an accurate method for mapping chromosomal breakpoints. Two varieties of jumping libraries (short-jump libraries and custom barcoded jumping libraries) were tested and compared to standard sequencing libraries. For standard NGS, 200-500bp fragments are generated. About 0.03% -0.54% of fragments represent chimeric pairs, which are pairs of end-reads that are mapped to two different chromosomes. Therefore, very few fragments cover the breakpoint area.When using short-jump libraries with fragments of 3.2-3.8kb, the percentage of chimeric pairs increased to 1.3%. With Custom Barcoded Jumping Libraries, the percentage of chimeric pairs further increased to 1.49%.|$|E
50|$|This {{specific}} <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> uses adaptors containing markers for fragment {{selection in}} combination with barcodes for multiplexing. The protocol was developed by Talkowski et al. and based on mate-pair library preparation for SOLiD sequencing. The selected DNA fragment size is 3.5 - 4.5 kb. Two adaptors were involved: one containing an EcoP15I recognition site and an AC overhang; the other containing a GT overhang, a biotinylated thymine, and an oligo barcode. The circularized DNA was digested and the fragments with biotynylated adaptors were selected for(See Figure 3). The EcoP15I recognition site and barcode help to distinguish junction fragments from nonjump fragments. These targeted fragments should contain 25 to 27bp of genomic DNA, the EcoP15I recognition site, the overhang, and the barcode.|$|E
50|$|Poustka and Lehrach {{suggested}} that full digestion with rare-cutting restrictions enzymes (such as NotI) {{should be used}} for the first step of the library construction instead of partial digestion with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme. This would significantly reduce the number of clones from millions to thousands. However, this could create problems with circularizing the DNA fragments since these fragments would be very long, and would also lose the flexibility in choice of end points that one gets in partial digests. One suggestion for overcoming these problems would be to combine the two methods, i.e. to construct a <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> from DNA fragments digested partially with a commonly cutting restriction enzyme and completely with a rare cutting restriction enzyme and circularizing them into plasmids cleaved with both enzymes. Several of these “combination” libraries were completed in 1986.|$|E
40|$|Background: Structural {{variation}} (SV) influences genome {{organization and}} contributes to human disease. However, the complete mutational spectrum of SV has not been routinely captured in disease association studies. Results: We sequenced 689 participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental abnormalities to construct a genome-wide map of large SV. Using long-insert <b>jumping</b> <b>libraries</b> at 105 X mean physical coverage and linked-read whole-genome sequencing from 10 X Genomics, we document seven major SV classes at ~ 5 kb SV resolution. Our results encompass 11, 735 distinct large SV sites, 38. 1 % of which are novel and 16. 8 % of which are balanced or complex. We characterize 16 recurrent subclasses of complex SV (cxSV), revealing that: (1) cxSV are larger and rarer than canonical SV; (2) each genome harbors 14 large cxSV on average; (3) 84. 4 % of large cxSVs involve inversion; and (4) most large cxSV (93. 8 %) have not been delineated in previous studies. Rare SVs {{are more likely to}} disrupt coding and regulatory non-coding loci, particularly when truncating constrained and disease-associated genes. We also identify multiple cases of catastrophic chromosomal rearrangements known as chromoanagenesis, including somatic chromoanasynthesis, and extreme balanced germline chromothripsis events involving up to 65 breakpoints and 60. 6 Mb across four chromosomes, further defining rare categories of extreme cxSV. Conclusions: These data provide a foundational map of large SV in the morbid human genome and demonstrate a previously underappreciated abundance and diversity of cxSV that should be considered in genomic studies of human disease...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{variation}} (SV) is {{a significant}} component of the genetic etiology of both neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders; however, routine guidelines for clinical genetic screening have been established only in the former category. Genome-wide chromosomal microarray (CMA) can detect genomic imbalances such as copy-number variants (CNVs), but balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) still require karyotyping for clinical detection. Moreover, submicroscopic BCAs and subarray threshold CNVs are intractable, or cryptic, to both CMA and karyotyping. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing using large-insert <b>jumping</b> <b>libraries</b> to delineate both cytogenetically visible and cryptic SVs in a single test among 30 clinically referred youth representing a range of severe neuropsychiatric conditions. We detected 96 SVs per person on average that passed filtering criteria above our highest-confidence resolution (6, 305  bp) and an additional 111 SVs per genome below this resolution. These SVs rearranged 3. 8 Mb of genomic sequence and resulted in 42 putative loss-of-function (LoF) or gain-of-function mutations per person. We estimate that 80 % of the LoF variants were cryptic to clinical CMA. We found myriad complex and cryptic rearrangements, including a “paired” duplication (360 kb, 169 kb) that flanks a 5. 25  Mb inversion that appears in 7 additional cases from clinical CNV data among 47, 562 individuals. Following convergent genomic profiling of these independent clinical CNV data, we interpreted three SVs to be of potential clinical significance. These data indicate that sequence-based delineation of the full SV mutational spectrum warrants exploration in youth referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation and clinical diagnostic SV screening more broadly...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days, {{chromosome}} walking from genetically linked DNA markers {{was used to}} identify and clone disease genes. However, the large molecular distance between known markers and the gene of interest was complicating the cloning process. In 1987, a human chromosome <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> was constructed to clone the cystic fibrosis gene. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 2000 Caucasians. This was the first disease in which {{the usefulness of the}} jumping libraries was demonstrated. Met oncogene was a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene on human chromosome 7, and the library was screened for a jumping clone starting at this marker. The cystic fibrosis gene was determined to localize 240kb downstream of the met gene. Chromosome jumping helped reduce the mapping “steps” and bypass the highly repetitive regions in the mammalian genome. Chromosome jumping also allowed the production of probes required for faster diagnosis of this and other diseases.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} pulsed-field gel {{electrophoresis}} of undigested DNA prepared by cell lysis in agarose with proteinase K detergent treatment and found a resolvable DNA fraction, denoted forum DNA (f-DNA). By changing the pulsed-field gel pulse length from 25 to 4500 sec, to obtain optimal separation in different ranges, we have found f-DNA to occupy a rather broad zone from 2 megabases to 10 kilobases (kb), but mainly at a range between 50 and 150 kb. f-DNA seems to appear {{as a result of}} nonrandom spontaneous degradation during cell treatment. The terminal regions of f-DNA segments have been cloned by using a <b>jumping</b> <b>library.</b> The molecular analysis of unique DNA sequence from an anonymous Drosophila DNA segment led to the conclusion that f-DNA appears as a result of nonrandom chromosomal DNA cleavage within sensitive regions that occupy a few kilobases. This conclusion was confirmed by detection of rather discrete hybridization bands on pulsed-field gel Southern blots in a region of good separation of undigested f-DNA after hybridization with different unique and repetitive probes. We propose that f-DNA segments may correspond to some regular higher-order structures in the eukaryotic chromosomes...|$|E

40|$|We have {{performed}} a comprehensive deletion survey of 3 p {{on more than}} 400 lung, renal, breast, cervical and ovarian carcinomas (major epithelial cancers) using a defined set of markers, combining conventional LOH with quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), NotI linking and <b>jumping</b> <b>libraries,</b> comparative genomic and NotI microarrays hybridizations. We identified two most frequently affected 3 p 21. 3 regions, LUCA (LUng CAncer) at the centromeric and AP 20 at the telomeric border of 3 p 21. 3. Aberrations of either region were detected in more than 90 % of the studied tumors suggesting they harbor multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSG). Homozygous deletions (HD) were frequently detected in all tumors in both the LUCA and AP 20 regions. To facilitate the identification of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in the chromosome 3 p 21. 3 AP 20 and LUCA sub-regions, we constructed physical and gene map of these segments. More than 30 genes were localized in these two regions and among them at least 12 TSGs were identified: RBSP 3, ITGA 9, MLH 1, VILL, APRG 1, RASSF 1, HYAL 1, HYAL 2, SEMA 3 B, SEMA 3 F, NPRL 2 and CACNA 2 D 2. Among these TSGs were representatives of new types of TSGs: e. g. HYAL 1 showing growth inhibiting activity only in vivo and RASSF 1 A and RASSF 1 C that are alternative forms of the same gene showing different tissue specificity. We found that several tumor suppressor genes in AP 20 and LUCA 3 p 21. 3 regions were co-regulated in tumors. These results supported the hypothesis on simultaneous inactivation of clusters cancer-causing genes in AP 20 and LUCA regions during the development and progression of lung cancer and other epithelial tumors. Moreover we found an exceptionally high incidence of single-base mutations in the tumor suppressor genes RASSF 1 and RBSP 3 (CTDSPL) in major epithelial tumors. These mutations functionally inactivated tumor suppressor activity of these genes. Somatic hypermutations in tumor suppressor genes involved in major human malignancies offer a novel insight in cancer development, progression and spread. The data could be important for development of specific biomarker sets for early cancer diagnosis and new therapeutic approaches/strategies for cancer treatment.

40|$|The {{search for}} the gene for choroideremia (MIM 30310), a rare retinal dystrophy, has been of great {{interest}} due {{to the existence of}} several choroideremia patients with well-defined structural chromosome aberrations, thus providing the basis for a reverse genetics approach to the isolation of this disease gene. This report details our molecular studies of a woman with choroideremia and a de novo X; 13 translocation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using a contourclamped homogeneous electric field apparatus has allowed detection of the translocation breakpoint with the anonymous DNA marker p 1 bD 5 (DXS 165) and the mapping of this probe to within 120 kb of the breakpoint. In addition, we have used this probe to isolate a clone (pCH 4) from a 100 -kb <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> which has crossed a rare-cutting restriction site (XhoI) between DXS 165 and the choroideremia gene and detects the translocation breakpoint using this enzyme.

Using a 100 -kb general <b>jumping</b> <b>library,</b> we isolated two sequential jump clones, J 31 and J 29, {{to one side}} of the D 7 S 8 region and one jump clone, J 32, to the other side of D 7 S 8, so that the total region covered is about 300 kb.

The orientation of D 7 S 8 will be useful for directing the isolation of other jump clones toward the CF locus.

40|$|The {{gene for}} Huntington disease (HD) has been {{localized}} to the distal {{portion of the}} short arm of human chromosome 4 by linkage analysis. Currently, the two closest DNA markers are D 4 S 10 (G 8), located approximately equal to 3 centimorgans centromeric to HD, and D 4 S 43 (C 4 H), positioned 0 - 1. 5 centimorgans from HD. In an effort to move closer to the HD gene, with the eventual goal of identifying the gene itself, we have applied the technique of chromosome jumping to this region. A 200 -kilobase <b>jumping</b> <b>library</b> has been constructed, and a jump from D 4 S 10 has been obtained and its approximate distance verified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.
