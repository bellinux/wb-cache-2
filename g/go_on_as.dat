5|$|In {{the latest}} {{incarnation}} of X-Factor, written by Peter David, depowered mutant Rictor and his longtime friend Shatterstar (with whom he'd had an ambiguous relationship) were shown in an on-panel kiss. After {{the issue was}} published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between them further. Shortly after, one of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval of Peter David's decision. Despite his complaints, however, both Peter David and Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada have defended the development, and the story will most likely <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October, Nani {{scored a}} {{controversial}} second goal as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 at home. He scored {{into an empty}} net after Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes rolled the ball out to take a free-kick he thought had been given for handball; however, play was allowed to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> referee Mark Clattenburg did not blow his whistle. On 27 November, Nani scored United's fifth goal in a 7–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Nani netted his first goal of 2011 as he scored the winning strike in a 2–1 home victory over Stoke City on 4 January.|$|E

25|$|On March 17, 1997, Hart {{was given}} a shot to regain the title against Sid in a steel cage and thus change the main event at WrestleMania. If Hart won, his match with Austin at WrestleMania would become a title match while if Sid won, the {{regularly}} scheduled title match pitting him against the Undertaker would <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned. Since their respective matches would be affected, both Undertaker and Austin interfered in the match with Austin trying to help Hart so he could wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Undertaker trying to help Sid so he could keep his championship opportunity. Sid won the match by escaping the cage after Undertaker slammed the door in Hart's face as {{he was trying to}} exit. While the steel cage was being dismantled, Vince McMahon attempted to interview Hart, but a furious Hart grabbed the microphone and shoved McMahon down the mat before yelling expletives at him.|$|E
25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} birth of their only child, {{daughter}} Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for [...] "interminable days" [...] while the Putsch ran its course.

Although Hazlitt does not entirely belong to the school of pure [...] "character" [...] critics, this essay does {{tend to be more}} of a [...] "character" [...] criticism than others, asserts Kinnaird, because Hazlitt shared with his Romantic contemporaries an [...] "ambivalence toward tragedy". Hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was [...] "obsessed with evil in the world [...] long to escape from knowledge of it in themselves [...] pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that the world must <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> it is." [...] Thus, Hazlitt could declare, [...] "It is we who are Hamlet." ...|$|E

500|$|Allen revisits some of {{the themes}} he had {{explored}} in Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and [...] "offer a depressing view on fate, fidelity, {{and the nature of}} man". That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the upper-middle class having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> though nothing has happened. Philip French compared the two films' plots and themes in The Observer, and characterised Match Points as a [...] "clever twist on the themes of chance and fate".|$|E

Originally, Devitt and Fale were scheduled to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> a duo, but the storyline was altered with them instead coming together with Karl Anderson and Tama Tonga to form an all-gaijin (foreigner) stable.

In naming the group, Devitt has stated that he specifically did not want the word [...] "the" [...] in front of the name or a name consisting of just three letters. Other names considered for the group included [...] "Bullet Parade" [...] and [...] "Bullet League". As of May 2016, the Bullet Club trademark is owned by NJPW.
