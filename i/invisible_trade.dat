40|$|After the Visegrad countries’ {{accession}} to the EU in 2004, {{one of the}} most remarkable developments was the sudden upturn in their mutual trade. In 2007 the value of aggregate intra-Visegrad trade was two and a half times higher than in 2003. The rate of growth in these countries’ trade with the EU 15 (the ‘old’ member states) was only half as much. Also, individual Visegrad countries showed higher export growth rates to other Visegrad members in the post-accession period than in the years before EU accession. These developments are reflected in the changes in the geographical distribution of trade. While the relative significance of intra-Visegrad trade increased substantially both in the immediate pre-accession years (2000 - 2003) and the immediate post-accession years (2004 - 2007), the shifts in favour of intra-Visegrad trade were stronger in the years after accession in the case of all four countries and in both exports and imports. Three years after the EU accession the relative significance of intra-Visegrad trade attained the level it had reached in 1985, that time still under the extreme protection from global competition provided by the CMEA. The research to find an explanation for the upturn of intra-Visegrad Group trade was primarily focused on the identification of changes in the composition of trade. This approach was supplemented by an investigation of intra-bloc trade in services and an analysis of the mutual FDI flows among the countries concerned. Various trade structure indicators (traditional descriptive, marginal intra-industry and revealed comparative advantage indicators), calculated in the framework of this research, show that {{accession to}} the EU has not brought about any abrupt changes in the commodity patterns and revealed comparative advantages. In bilateral trade relations, apart from some exceptions, the changes observed were typically continuous and gradual, overarching the whole period 2000 - 2007. This is, however, no reason to claim that EU accession had a minor role in the upturn of mutual trade in the region concerned – rather, the effect is not focused on the year of accession (and +/– one year). Despite the clearly hesitant attitude of the incumbent EU members towards eastern enlargement in the 1990 s and the lack of their final commitment up until 2002, with the year of accession approaching it became more and more obvious that the accession would take place indeed. In this gradual process of self-conviction the firms involved in the intra-Visegrad Group trade may have gradually elaborated their new, geographically more diversified sales/procurement strategy. In the new strategic concepts of the main exporting firms (mostly multinationals) the Visegrad region itself is thought to have been upgraded both as a target for sales and as a host of potential cooperation partners for production. Results from the gravity modelling exercise indicated that there was no significant change in intra-Visegrad trade post- 2004 after controlling for typical gravity determinants. Combined with the observed increase in intra-Visegrad trade these results would tend to suggest that the observed increases in trade were largely the result of the relatively strong rates of growth of per capita GDP in Visegrad countries and not due to accession per se. The results from the gravity exercise further indicate that the changes in intra-Visegrad trade have occurred mainly along the extensive margin, with a greater variety of products traded amongst Visegrad countries. Services trade was found to be too low to cause any significant productivity changes that would influence merchandise exports dynamics of the Visegrad countries. The prevalence of traditional transport and travel services in the services trade structures also points to a lower importance of services for the countries’ economies, in particular for merchandise trade developments. Our results may indicate an insufficient level of development of Visegrad countries yet, which prevents them from using services more efficiently. EU accession did not have a one-time effect on FDI among the Visegrad countries and also the comparison of the pre- and post-accession periods does not reveal any increase in the importance of mutual investments. This means that it was not mutual FDI that was driving trade. FDI among the Visegrad countries is rather low because there are not many local companies that are able to invest abroad. Those that do invest in the Visegrad area aim at serving mainly the local market of the target country, which has little trade-enhancing effect. There must be, however, a link between mutual trade and FDI from outside the region. Most of the Visegrad countries’ exports are generated by foreign subsidiaries of multinationals from the EU- 15 and other developed countries. These subsidiaries are linked by intra-company trade, sourcing and selling in the Visegrad region. After EU enlargement, foreign investors have concentrated the production of consumer goods sold in the region in a lower number of locations which also generated trade among the Visegrad countries. Our analysis has an important message for the Southeast European countries, all aspiring for EU membership and simultaneously participating in the regional free trade agreement CEFTA. Facilitating the upturn of mutual trade by the governments concerned has been regarded by the EU as an important step towards membership. The research results testify that in the process of the intra-bloc trade revival the year of EU accession does not appear in the time series as a major watershed in terms of commodity patterns, intra-industry trade or revealed comparative advantage. The developments, primarily specialization, took place gradually, starting prior to and continuing after the accession to the EU. That does not exclude that the removal of administrative and other, mainly invisible obstacles to free trade on the day of accession did not support the upswing of mutual trade, but it could not be the major force behind the phenomenon as it took place in the bilateral Visegrad–EU- 15 trade as well, without producing a spectacular upturn in that relation. Our assumption is that the likely driving force of the intra-Visegrad trade expansion has been a change in the networking strategy of the multinational companies located in the region around the date of EU accession. This change manifested itself in upgraded intra-firm deliveries among affiliates located in two or more of the four Visegrad countries. In this sense the increasing presence of multinational firms (more FDI projects and related inflows) is the key to rapid expansion of intra-CEFTA trade. This is, however, closely related to the prospects of the individual CEFTA members concerning the date of their EU accession. The legal stability provided by the gradual takeover of the acquis communautaire, on the one hand, and the prospects of removing all administrative and other, <b>invisible</b> obstacles to <b>trade</b> within the CEFTA region, on the other hand, are the connecting link between FDI, EU accession and an upturn in intra-CEFTA trade. Thus the summarized policy recommendation from our project for the Southeast European EU aspirants is that good progress in the accession negotiations, professional preparatory work for starting such talks and, further, the creation of an FDI-friendly regulatory environment may become key elements of a policy targeted at the upswing of intra-regional trade. intra-regional trade, Visegrad Group, CEFTA, trade patterns, intra-industry trade, revealed comparative advantage, marginal intra-industry trade, volume and variety of goods traded, gravity model, trade in services, FDI...|$|R

The production globalization and the tendency of liberalization of the trade with merchandises, in the spirit of the European Union, have extended to the trade with non-tangible goods as well, and the demand for services has increased, massively contributing to the extension of the array of tradable services and the internationalization, at a fast pace, of the <b>invisible</b> <b>trade.</b> The international transactions with services represent, today, a major component of the international flow of values.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{sheds light on}} the interactional and institutional processes through which child welfare and child protection practices are delivered to fifteen Dutch and fifteen Dutch-Curaçaoan single-mother families with multiple problems in the Netherlands in order to reveal structures of power, dominance and oppression. Because state intervention practices remain largely ‘invisible’ from the public gaze {{it is important to}} ‘Disentangle an invisible trade’ (the title of the {{doctoral thesis}}). Tessa Verhallen draws on a thirty-month ethnographic study undertaken with thirty single-mother families between 2009 and 2012 in order to demonstrate how state interventions are carried out in these families. Verhallen uses the empirically grounded theory of Agar (1985) on institutional discourse to address the research question of how state interventions are shaped by institutional discourse and power asymmetries in encounters between single-mother families with multiple problems and state representatives. As the title of the doctoral thesis suggests, Verhallen aims to unravel the 'invisible trade' (Pithouse 1998) phenomena step-by-step by descending down different levels of aggregation. First the macro-level Dutch ‘multi-problem family’ policy and practice is explained and analyzed. Thereafter, the focus switches to the meso-level successive and multi-sited intervention practices taken place in the single-mother families. After this, the micro-level interaction between a family supervisor and a single-mother is the focus of scrutiny. Since Verhallen holds the opinion that an ethnographic study on state intervention processes in single-mother families made her by definition subjective and engaged, as she formed part of the asymmetrical power setting that she analyzed, the ego-level is the last focus of study. She scrutinized her own role as a participant observer in the single-mother families and discusses the ethical dilemmas she faced in her study. Verhallen aims to disentangle an <b>invisible</b> <b>trade</b> through the combined ethnographic-critical discourse analytical framework that she has developed for the analysis of empirical data upon which the chapters are drawn. All four levels together make transparent how institutional discourse is (re) produced and constituted within sites of a larger system which is influenced by power asymmetries...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of Natal, 2003. This MBA {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} 'Feasibility & Attractiveness of FDI in emerging Namibian market', {{and the overall}} impact on the country's international competitiveness as World Trade Organization (WTO) and SADC member. One of the most sensitive areas in international economics is Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) which {{need to be considered}} when Multinational Corporations (MNCs) intend seeking exposure to emerging markets in establishing a subsidiary company in a developing country. Developing countries fear exploitation and inadequate access to foreign capital, technology, marketing & management skills. Many countries such as Indonesia and Russia have accumulated huge foreign indebtedness on which it is difficult to pay even the interest. High indebtedness, high inflation and high unemployment in several countries have resulted in unstable governments exposing foreign firms to the risks of expropriation, nationalization, and limits on profit repatriation. High indebtedness and political instability decrease the value of a county's foreign currency. Foreign firms want hard currency generation with profit repatriation rights, unavailable in many markets. Foreign -government entry requirements and bureaucracy enforce foreign entry regulations on firms with joint ventures with majority share to domestic partner, high number of employed nationals, transfer of technological skills and profit repatriation. Governments often impose high tariffs or resort to <b>invisible</b> <b>trade</b> barriers to protect their industries. The Namibian government can regulate the operations of foreign firms in various ways. Analysis of economic and development factors affecting FDI which negatively or positively influence future investments in the country are examined. Namibia has a good track record of economic and infrastructure development progress. The long-term Development strategy, Vision 2020, aims to achieve developed nation status in both economic and development sectors by the year 2020. Past economic crisis and the exposure to underlying structural weaknesses in financial and corporate sectors, threatened to undermine the country's achievements. Selective capital controls were introduced in an effort to limit currency volatility, additional to the structural reform measures implemented in corporate & financial sectors. One of the key determinants of a sustainable economy is the diversification of its industries. A more balanced economy prevents dependence on any particular sector or number of sectors of the economy and stabilizes economic fluctuations. Diversified industries bring new money into an economy, expand the tax base and provide increased support for infrastructure development projects such as roads, schools, community services and locally dependent small businesses. It is also believed that there is diversified linkages across the sectors of the economy. This type of economy is expected to generate more employment and self-sustaining prerequisite for continued growth in real incomes and employment, which provide a basis for poverty reduction. The research highlights some of the policies and initiatives, which the Namibian government has put in place since Independence to broaden the manufacturing base of the country and to promote export diversification. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess whether these efforts to promote diversification have borne the desired results. In other words. has there been a structural shift in the country's production structure during the period under consideration The research design or overall strategic choice is based on a combination of exploratory & descriptive method due to the structured nature of the research problem. Qualitative & quantitative methods are used for data collection based on economic & development factors influencing FDI in the country. The Ministry of Finance recently submitted it's Annual Report, including its annual accounts and reports on its operations and affairs and the general state of the Namibian economy. These Reports and reports accumulated during interviews, as well as data-collection during mail surveys will also be analyzed in an attempt to evaluate Namibia's overall attractiveness for FDI. Exploration: Qualitative methods were employed. I augmented my knowledge of FDI in Namibia by personally interviewing managers and CEOs from government, local and foreign companies and developed questionnaires as a mail survey. Questionnaire design: A self-administered questionnaire secured feedback on FDI in Namibia. Some questions for this instrument were based on the investigation of Central Business District Enterprises and from executive interviews. A comment / suggestion section was included. Pilot Test: I tested the questionnaire with a small sample of CEO's. Revision of the questionnaire was undertaken and it was amended appropriately, after which the final questionnaire was submitted using the mail survey. Evaluation of on-response bias: Random sample of non-respondents. Sample frame was established. Respondents were interviewed telephonically and their responses were used in a statistical comparison of responses _ respondents vs non- respondent samples were taken. In recognition of the critical role SMEs can play in the socio-economic development of the country and economic development of the country and economic diversification, the Government has put in place policies and programmes for the development of SMEs. The main thrust is to increase the rate of growth of existing businesses to ensure the employment of more people. The second thrust is the reduction of business failures while increasing the development of new business formations. The third thrust is the diversification of the activities of the sector includes continuing efforts to improve and empowering environment, including pro-active programme and institutional Supply. More specifically, the assistance programmes for SMEs target the critical areas of access to finance, skills development, marketing, technology transfer, management and institutional support. Such a comprehensive policy framework is expected to enhance the economic role of SMEs not only in terms of their contribution to employment and poverty reduction, but also in terms of contribution to economic diversification. The development and promotion of the SME sector IS an integral part of the Special Industrialisation Programme (SIP), which is designed to render practical support to viable business ideas and plans. The long-term objective of this programme is to promote export-oriented production and where appropriate import substitution. International businesses like multinational companies participate the foreign exchange market to facilitate international trade & investment, to invest spare cash in short-term money market accounts in Namibia & to engage in currency speculation. FOI can make positive contributors to Namibia by supplying the capital, technology and management resources that would otherwise not be available. These endorsements can positively influence the overall economic status of the Namibian people. Benefits of the study can translate into effective marketing of Namibia as WTO and SAOC member and to encourage FOI investor confidence & growth in Namibia. High levels of FOI can translate into positive outputs in terms of economic & growth potential FOI in Namibia, strong global trade and accelerated growth potential in developing African countries. Namibia has recently joined the WTO as member country, does it have a sustainable economy & the infrastructure to attract FOI This research has confidence in the potential for improving economic & development factors that will invite FOI in Namibia. This research desires information on the 'Feasibility & Attractiveness of FOI in amibia and the overall impact on the country's international competitiveness.
