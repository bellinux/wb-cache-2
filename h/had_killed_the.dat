5|$|Although communists <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> entire {{imperial}} Romanov {{family in}} July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors {{that members of}} the Tsar's family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov.|$|E
5|$|Lundström {{points out}} (p.134) {{that some of}} the {{international}} and national reports took on the features of urban legends. They reflected a prevailing disrespect for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who were portrayed in the newspapers as uncomprehending savages who <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> three men or showed a deadly indifference to their plight. These speculations were refuted in 1930, upon the discovery of the expedition's final resting place on Kvitøya by the crews of two ships, the Bratvaag and the Isbjørn.|$|E
5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> boy developed into the position that, {{because of the}} trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.|$|E

2500|$|This {{alternative}} interpretation may {{be justified}} because Théoden {{may not have}} been proud of <b>having</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> banner-bearer so much as <b>having</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> enemy leader himself. Another interpretation has Théoden speaking figuratively; by [...] "felling the black serpent", he not only cut down the black serpent standard but defeated the horsemen of Harad, at least temporarily.|$|R
5|$|The King and the Queens {{also started}} to openly {{challenge}} Bhimsen's authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives {{had heard the}} widespread rumor that Bhimsen, {{in order to remain}} in power, <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison a few days after Girvan's coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen. Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen's plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the mukhtiyar.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt that the Israelis <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)both {{of which}} were {{elements}} of the 2nd Operational Groupwith cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nikšić Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd Motorized Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th Border Patrol Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised Territorial Defence units from Herceg-Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokić. Jokić replaced Admiral Krsto Đurović, {{who had died in}} uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinović, once commanding the 472nd Motorized Brigade and subordinate of Đurović, said that the JNA <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinović resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive.|$|E

5|$|The Karankawa Indians {{used the}} land near the Guadalupe River delta and San Antonio Bay for camping purposes. They also {{populated}} Matagorda Island {{on the opposite}} side of the bay. Captain Luis Cazorla of Presidio La Bahía crossed San Antonio Bay to visit the island in 1776, and discovered that the Indians <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> mates of a shipwrecked British trading vessel. For a short time, he convinced the Indian leaders not to kill shipwreck survivors on the island. An effort was made to convert the Indians with the establishment of Mission Refugio on San Antonio Bay in 1793, after Fray José Francisco Garza found a shallow crossing that the Indians used to travel to the mainland. To prevent the Indians from using Matagorda Island as a hiding place to stage attacks, La Bahía commandant Juan Cortés burned and cut brush around the point of crossing. No permanent colony was ever established on the island.|$|E
5|$|The city finally fell on {{the morning}} of 21 May 878, after nine months of siege. The {{defenders}} had withdrawn to the walls to rest and breakfast, leaving a small guard to hold the breach under a certain John Patrianos, when the Arabs launched a sudden attack, firing all their siege engines at once and charging the breach. By the time the patrikios came forth to rally the defence, the Arabs <b>had</b> <b>killed</b> <b>the</b> defenders of the breach and broken through into the city. A detachment that tried to blockade the way near the Church of the Saviour was likewise annihilated; Theodosios writes that the Arabs entered the church, where much of the populace had sought refuge, and massacred them all. The patrikios was left with some 70 men to hold an isolated tower, until he was forced to surrender the next day. Theodosios himself was assisting the liturgy in the cathedral when news of the city's fall came, and was taken prisoner along with the archbishop. Unlike the Church of the Saviour, the Arab soldiers did not mistreat them, but forced the archbishop to reveal the location of the sacristy where the precious liturgical objects where held.|$|E

When Starkad had left the battle, the sons of Gandalf retired as well, and so Sigurd had won the battle against the Swedes.|$|E
