40|$|In this study, the {{replacement}} of 50 % NaCl by KCl in Bologna sausage {{with the addition of}} <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> blends (coriander, onion, white pepper, cardamom, and Jamaican pepper) was evaluated. The formulations tested showed a significant reduction in the sodium content with no major alterations in the emulsion stability, texture, and microbiological characteristics. The use of 50 % KCl caused a reduction in the sensory quality leading to a significant decrease in the consumers' purchase intention. The formulations with the addition of <b>herbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> blends presented better results in the sensory evaluation indicating that this strategy can reduce the negative effects resulting from the use of KCl...|$|R

40|$|The Apiaceae family {{includes}} vegetables, {{as well as}} <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> crops. Compared {{to major}} crops, {{there have been few}} breeding or genetic improvement programs for any of the Apiaceae, especially the <b>herb</b> <b>and</b> <b>spice</b> species. Haploidy technology can be used to develop uniform, true-breeding lines, as well as to accelerate breeding programs. Field trials of dill (Anethum graveolens L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) doubled haploid (DH) lines were conducted over 2 5 cropping seasons. Several of the DH dill lines had desirable agronomic characteristics such as short uniform stature along with early maturity that would be useful for crop improvement. Seed yields and the essential oil content of the seed harvested from the best performing DH dill lines were either equal to or higher than the parental line. A DH annual caraway line was identified that produced higher seed yields than the industry standard. The main constituents of the essential oil for the DH lines of both dill and caraway were similar to the parental lines. Fennel DH lines exhibited differences in height but were too late in maturity for seed production under prairie conditions. The results indicate that not only were we able to generate DH lines {{that could be used in}} a crop improvement program, but we developed DH lines that could be used directly as cultivars as these lines performed better than the industry standard (parental line).
