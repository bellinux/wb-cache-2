5|$|Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris {{departed}} {{in quick}} succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt {{because of a}} blow to the ribs, Tallon came in at 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour before falling at 6/172.

5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. <b>In</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's batting {{performance}} in 1928 {{was similar to}} that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed his slow start (at one stage, he took half an hour to score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. For the same team at Lord's, he scored 86 and 40. He captained The Rest against England in a Test trial and made the highest score in each innings, scoring 74 not out in the fourth innings to help his team to draw the game on a difficult pitch, against international bowlers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.|$|E

5|$|In 1670, Gabriel Mouton, a French abbot and astronomer, {{published}} the book Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium {{in which he}} proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication, {{to be based on}} the dimensions of the Earth. The milliare would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria, the centuria into 10 decuria and so on, successive units being the virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and the millesima. Mouton used Riccioli's estimate that one degree of arc was 321,185 Bolognese feet, and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat 3959.2 times <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205.6mm – using today's knowledge of the size of the earth, the virgula would have been approximately 185.2mm. He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use.|$|E
5|$|Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 {{without further}} {{addition}} to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it {{high in the air}} after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton taking risks in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up the fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered {{from the edge of the}} crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.|$|E

25|$|Davis played three matches of {{first-class}} cricket for Hawke's Bay in 1920-21. They were Hawke's Bay's {{last three}} matches as a first-class team. In the second match, against Wellington, {{a few days}} before Davis's 19th birthday, Hawke's Bay followed on 286 runs in arrears and were 167 for 7 in their second innings when Davis went to the wicket. He hit 61 <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour, at one point hitting nine boundaries in a little over ten minutes. Nevertheless Hawke's Bay lost by an innings and 17 runs.|$|E
25|$|Càrn Aosda {{reaches a}} height of 917 metres (3008feet), {{at one point in}} time it had the honour of being the lowest of the Munros but more {{accurate}} mapping techniques have changed this and it is now the 279th ranked mountain in that classification. Càrn Aosda, along with the adjoining Munro of The Cairnwell, is regarded as the easiest of the Munros to ascend, this is because of the high starting altitude of over 640 metres at the ski centre and the easy walking conditions on rough vehicle tracks which lead directly to the summit.

25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|E
25|$|Flamson {{was still}} a regular member of the side though he took fewer wickets in 1938 – 53 wickets in the season at the lower average of 27.41 – and he missed a month of the season through injury. His one innings of note as a batsman was in this season: he made an unbeaten 50 <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour in the game against Northamptonshire. In 1939, in an {{unsuccessful}} team that finished {{at the bottom of}} the County Championship, Flamson was himself not successful, taking 36 wickets at the very high average of 38.16. He lost his place in the team at the start of July, though he returned for a single match towards the end of August which proved to be the last match of his first-class cricket career.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the breach, the Israeli commander, Shimon Forsher, ordered all {{residents}} to retreat to an inner defensive perimeter. At this stage, the Egyptians took control of another line of structures, and entered a stalemate with the Israelis about 30m away from the inner perimeter. At 10:40 Be'erot Yitzhak reported that its fences had been breached from three directions and were within range of hand grenades. The Israeli commander was wounded, and his deputy was killed. In a battle for the nursery school, an Israeli PIAT managed to drive out the Egyptian soldiers. Another building was also hit by a PIAT, making the Egyptians withdraw. Despite the successful counterattack, at 11:15 the village reported that its situation was critical and they would surrender <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour if help would not come. This was repeated at least twice more during the battle.|$|E

25|$|In reply, India reached 1/82 {{at the end}} of {{the second}} day. All of their batsmen made a start, none of the top seven scoring less than 24, but only Amarnath (64) and Hazare (75) passed 50. India were out for 339 just before stumps on the third day and were forced to follow on. Four Australian bowlers took two wickets. The second innings {{followed}} a similar pattern and all of the top five Indian batsmen passed 20 without passing 70. India reached 8/239 and were only 47 runs ahead, leaving Australia in striking distance of victory, but Gul Mohammad and Amir Elahi added 51 for the ninth wicket and pushed the total to 304. This left Australia with 103 runs to win <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. However, the Indian captain Merchant placed all of his fielders on the off side and instructed his bowlers to deliver the ball wide. The Australians ended at 1/31.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a tougher}} fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England's Test spin {{combination}} of Jim Laker and Tony Lock. Miller {{came in at}} 3/124 to join Colin McDonald and struggled, scoring 18runs in his first 120minutes; it was the slowest two hours of scoring in his career, featuring much pad play as he attempted to play Laker from the crease, and stretching forward with his long arms when necessary. Such was Miller's watchfulness that he only scored 21 of 97 runs as Australia lost 6/97 to be 9/217, whereas he was normally an attacking batsman. As his partners continued to fall, Miller accelerated and scored 36 of the 42runs in the last-wicket partnership with Jack Wilson <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> hour. He cut loose in two consecutive overs from Lock, taking 11 and 14 respectively. He ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Surrey then scored 347. Miller fell to Lock for two in the second innings as Australia collapsed as lost 9/34 for 107. Such was the spin-friendly nature of the surface that Surrey's new ball pairing bowled only three overs before Laker and Lock took over. During the match, the home team's spin pairing bowled more than 65% of the overs, something {{that was to be}} repeated throughout the summer. Surrey then compiled the 20 runs required for victory, inflicting a ten-wicket defeat, Australia's first loss to a county since 1912. Following the loss, sections of the Australian media, led by Jack Fingleton, began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.|$|E
