40|$|Surface runoff {{generation}} on arable fields is {{an important}} driver of (local) flooding, on-site and off-site damages by erosion, and of nutrient and agrochemical transport. In general, three different processes generate surface runoff (Hortonian runoff, saturation excess runoff, and return of subsurface flow). Despite the developments {{in our understanding of}} these processes it remains difficult to predict, which processes govern runoff generation during the course of an event or throughout the year, when soil and vegetation on arable land are passing many states. We analysed the results from 317 rainfall simulations with a resolution of 14286 runoff measurements to determine temporal and spatial differences in parameters governing surface runoff, and to derive and test a statistical model of surface runoff generation independent from an a priori selection of modelled processes types. Measured runoff was related to 20 time-invariant soil properties, three variable soil properties, four rain properties, three land use properties and many derived variables describing interactions and curvilinear behaviour. In an iterative multiple regression procedure, six of these properties/variables best described <b>initial</b> <b>abstraction</b> and the hydrograph. To estimate <b>initial</b> <b>abstraction,</b> a percentage of stone cover above 10 % and of sand content in the bulk soil were needed, while the hydrograph could be predicted best from rain depth exceeding <b>initial</b> <b>abstraction,</b> rainfall intensity, soil organic carbon content, and time since last tillage. Combining the multiple regressions to estimate <b>initial</b> <b>abstraction</b> and surface runoff allowed modelling of event-specific hydrographs without an a priori assumption of the underlying process. The statistical model described the measured data well and performed equally well during validation. In both cases, the model explained 71 and 58 % of variability in runoff volume and runoff rate (RSME: 5. 2 mm and 0. 23 mm min − 1, respectively). Stone cover was most important for the <b>initial</b> <b>abstraction</b> while time since tillage was most important for the hydrograph. The latter variable is neither taken into account in typical lumped hydrological models (e. g.

An <b>initial</b> coarse <b>abstraction</b> is provided and iteratively refined until either the property is proved to be true or false. Computing a precise abstraction is usually very expensive. Thus, many techniques have been conceived in order to approximate the ab-stract transition relation. In the framework of predicate abstraction, ex-amples of such techniques are early quantification, Cartesian approx-imation, maximum cube length approximation, predicate partitioning, and interpolation-based approximation. When such approximations are employed, adding new predicates is no more sufficient to rule out all spu-rious counterexamples. Standard model checkers add new contraints to the transition relations in order to refine the approximation. We propose a uniform framework for describing most of known approx-imation techniques.
