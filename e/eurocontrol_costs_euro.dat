40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{associated}} with considerable burden of illness at a patient, family and societal level. Although pharmacological treatment is recommended by authoritative guidelines, evidence on its influence on the broader burden of illness is limited. As treatment induces costs, proper healthcare decision making requires evidence on the associated societal costs or benefits and particularly the difference that response to treatment can make. Data on ADHD related resource use of patients 8 - 18 years and parents were collected {{by means of a}} cross-sectional, online survey amongst members of the Dutch parent association. Children were stratified to responders and non-responders to treatment according to pre-defined expert definitions. Analyses were performed on 618 questionnaires (428 responders; 190 non-responders to treatment). Children were 11. 8 years on average and mainly boys (82 %). Total monthly costs for children were euro 578 and euro 839 for responders and non-responders, respectively (p = 0. 021), with a breakdown to direct medical <b>costs</b> (<b>euro</b> 322 vs. euro 512; p = 0. 068), direct non-medical <b>costs</b> (<b>euro</b> 222 vs. euro 296; p = 0. 090), and indirect non-medical <b>costs</b> (<b>euro</b> 34 vs. euro 57; p < 0. 001). For parents, total <b>costs</b> were <b>euro</b> 246 vs. euro 399 for the responding and non-responding children, respectively (p = 0. 006), with a breakdown to direct medical <b>costs</b> (<b>euro</b> 130 vs. euro 211; p = 0. 010) and indirect non-medical <b>costs</b> (<b>euro</b> 116 vs. euro 181; p = 0. 092). Total monthly costs of children and their parents together were euro 824 and euro 1228 for responders and non-responders to treatment, respectively (p = 0. 002). These results stress the importance of a focus on response to treatment, not only beneficial for patients and their family, but also resulting in considerable societal benefits...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Falls are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in older people and frequently lead to hospital admission. There is a current lack of cohesive fall prevention strategies in the Republic of Ireland. AIM: To demonstrate the cost of fall-related admissions to an acute hospital. METHODS: A review of Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) data and medical case notes was performed for all fall-related admissions over a one-year period. The cost of fall-related admissions was calculated. In addition a detailed cost analysis was performed to determine {{the true cost of}} a hip fracture admission. RESULTS: There were 810 fall-related admissions, resulting in 8, 300 acute bed days, and 6, 220 rehabilitation bed days, <b>costing</b> <b>euros</b> 10. 3 million. Fall-related readmissions resulted in 650 bed-days, bringing the total <b>cost</b> to <b>euros</b> 10. 8 million. A typical hip fracture incident admission episode <b>costs</b> <b>euros</b> 14, 300. CONCLUSION: Fall-related admissions of olderpeople are a significant financial burden to the health service...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: CT is {{increasingly}} {{used during the}} initial evaluation of blunt trauma patients. In this era of increasing cost-awareness, {{the pros and cons}} of CT have to be assessed. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to evaluate cost-consequences of different diagnostic algorithms that use thoracoabdominal CT in primary evaluation of adult patients with high-energy blunt trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared three different algorithms in which CT was applied as an immediate diagnostic tool (rush CT), a diagnostic tool after limited conventional work-up (routine CT), and a selective tool (selective CT). Probabilities of detecting and missing clinically relevant injuries were retrospectively derived. We collected data on radiation exposure and performed a micro-cost analysis on a reference case-based approach. RESULTS: Both rush and routine CT detected all thoracoabdominal injuries in 99. 1 % of the patients during primary evaluation (n = 1040). Selective CT missed one or more diagnoses in 11 % of the patients in which a change of treatment was necessary in 4. 8 %. Rush CT algorithm <b>costed</b> <b>euro</b> 2676 (US$ 3660) per patient with a mean radiation dose of 26. 40 mSv per patient. Routine CT <b>costed</b> <b>euro</b> 2815 (US$ 3850) and resulted in the same radiation exposure. Selective CT resulted in less radiation dose (23. 23 mSv) and <b>costed</b> <b>euro</b> 2771 (US$ 3790). CONCLUSIONS: Rush CT seems to result in the least costs and is comparable in terms of radiation dose exposure and diagnostic certainty with routine CT after a limited conventional work-up. However, selective CT results in less radiation dose exposure but a slightly higher cost and less certainty...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: More than 120000 {{people are}} {{diagnosed}} annually with bladder {{cancer in the}} 28 countries of the European Union (EU). With > 40000 people dying of it each year, it is the sixth leading cause of cancer. However, to date, no systematic cost-of-illness study has assessed {{the economic impact of}} bladder cancer in the EU. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the annual economic costs of bladder cancer in the EU for 2012. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Country-specific cancer cost data were estimated using aggregate data on morbidity, mortality, and health care resource use, obtained from numerous international and national sources. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Health care costs were estimated from expenditures on primary, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient care, as well as medications. Costs of unpaid care and lost earnings due to morbidity and early death were estimated. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Bladder cancer <b>cost</b> the EU <b>euro</b> 4. 9 billion in 2012, with health care accounting for euro 2. 9 billion (59 %) and representing 5 % of total health care cancer costs. Bladder cancer accounted for 3 % of all cancer costs in the EU (euro 143 billion) in 2012 and represented an annual health care <b>cost</b> of <b>euro</b> 57 per 10 EU citizens, with costs varying > 10 times between the country with the lowest <b>cost,</b> Bulgaria (<b>euro</b> 8 for every 10 citizens), and highest <b>cost,</b> Luxembourg (<b>euro</b> 93). Productivity losses and informal care represented 23 % and 18 % of bladder cancer costs, respectively. The quality and availability of comparable cancer-related data across the EU need further improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to essential public health and policy intelligence for delivering affordable bladder cancer care systems and prioritising the allocation of public research funds. PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at the economic costs of bladder cancer across the European Union (EU).

Patients with schizophrenia and related disorders (28 % of the patients) absorbed about 60 % of total costs and made extensive use of several types of services (hospital, outpatient, domiciliary, social and rehabilitative). Since integrating different different types of services is the key element of Italian psychiatric care, the new fee-for-service system adopted by the NHS to fund providers does not appear appropriate, particularly for schizophrenic patients...|$|R
