5|$|Okehampton Castle {{was built}} between 1068 and 1086 {{following}} the Norman conquest of England by Baldwin FitzGilbert. William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon forces {{at the battle}} of Hastings in 1066, but violence continued to <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> periodically for several years after the invasion. Baldwin FitzGilbert, a Norman lord, was responsible for putting down a rebellion in Devon in 1068. He was probably given extensive lands in the county at this time, and by the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he was noted as the owner of the Honour of Okehampton and well as the Sheriff of Devon and Constable of Exeter Castle. The Honour of Okehampton was a grouping of around 200 estates across Devon, guarded by several castles, including Baldwin's main castle - or caput - at Okehampton, and those owned by his tenants, including Neroche and Montacute.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Rockets, as McGrady {{appeared}} in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including a moment in January where {{he had to be}} carried off the court in a stretcher due to a severe <b>flare</b> <b>up.</b> Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year's All-Star Game in front of his home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 minutes. For the season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

5|$|On occasion, the {{convection}} of {{the system}} would <b>flare</b> <b>up,</b> {{and in the early}} morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, Florida reported winds of 50mph (80km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92mph (147km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998millibars (29.47 inHg). In the evening and overnight hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay. The depression crossed Florida, weakening significantly, and becoming extratropical. After emerging from land in the Atlantic Ocean on November 5, the depression had become a low pressure area once again and was last spotted that day near the Carolina Capes.|$|E

25|$|The {{fortunes}} of the decentralized movement fluctuated throughout the early 1920s but by 1923 the Red Army's extensive campaigns dealt the Basmachis many defeats.

Resistance to Soviet/Russian rule did <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> again {{to a lesser extent}} in response to collectivization campaigns in the pre-WWII Era.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the papacy from 1048 to 1257 would {{continue}} to be marked by conflict between popes and the Holy Roman Emperor, most prominently the Investiture Controversy, a dispute over who—pope or emperor—could appoint bishops within the Empire. Henry IV's Walk to Canossa in 1077 to meet Pope Gregory VII (1073–85), although not dispositive {{within the context of the}} larger dispute, has become legendary. Although the emperor renounced any right to lay investiture in the Concordat of Worms (1122), the issue would <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> again.|$|E

Cinna, expelled from Rome, met up with the exiled Gaius Marius, and both laid siege to Rome. During the early phase of this conflict, the Senate, fearing that they may need additional troops and commanders, ordered Metellus Pius to negotiate a peace with the Samnites.|$|E
25|$|Temperatures in the mid-30 degrees Celsius (mid-90 degrees Fahrenheit), northerly winds, and a cool change precipitated a <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> {{of many of}} the fires, and ignited {{several new}} fires. The most {{significant}} new fires were in the southern Dandenong Ranges near Upwey, south of Daylesford (near Hogans Lane, Musk Vale), and in the Otway Ranges. Weather conditions directed previously burning fires in the Yarra Ranges towards settlements in the upper Yarra Valley, but the fires were of a low intensity and were quickly contained.|$|E
25|$|While most infants born {{to mothers}} who have SLE are healthy, {{pregnant}} mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery.

In addition, SLE can <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain {{the health of the}} mother longer. Women pregnant and known to have anti-Ro (SSA) or anti-La antibodies (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature.|$|E
