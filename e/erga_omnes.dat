In such cases the judge can skip the compensatory stage and order redress directly.

50|$|By contrast, {{the civil}} law of German-speaking {{countries}} does not differentiate between delict (Delikt) and quasi-delict (Quasidelikt) as do French and Roman law. Under German Deliktsrecht, or ‘law of delict’, claims for damages can arise from either fault-based liability (Verschuldenshaftung), i.e. with intention (Vorsatz) or through negligence (Fahrlässigkeit), or strict liability (Gefährdungshaftung).

50|$|Universal {{jurisdiction}} is {{a controversial}} principle in international law, whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over people whose alleged crimes were committed outside {{the boundaries of}} the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence or any other relationship to the prosecuting country.

50|$|Second, the {{articles}} create new rights for injured states, principally, {{the right to}} invoke responsibility (Articles 42 and 48) and a limited right to take countermeasures (Articles 49-53). These rights, however, are heavily state-centred and do not deal with how state responsibility is to be implemented if the {{holder of the right}} is an individual or an organisation. The principal element of progressive development in this area is Article 48, which provides that certain violations of international obligations can affect the international community as a whole such that state responsibility can be invoked by states on behalf of the larger community. This provision picks up on the ICJ's celebrated suggestion in Barcelona Traction that some obligations are owed <b>erga</b> <b>omnes,</b> toward the international community as a whole.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to Roman law, however, {{is that in}} South Africa {{prevails}} the Roman-Dutch {{doctrine of}} huur gaat voor koop (“lease trumps sale”).

Once the lessee takes possession of the res, he acquires a limited real right <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> in the res {{for the duration of}} the lease and will thereafter be protected by the maxim huur gaat voor koop. For long leases, every successor-in-title of the lessor is automatically bound by the lease, but for short leases, the successors are not bound until the transfer of the res has been registered, irrespective of whether they are aware of its existence. The lessee's protection under the rule is conditional on payment of the rent for the unexpired term of the lease to the new lessor. The rule applies only to material terms; it therefore covers the option to renew a lease but does not bind the new lessor in respect of an option to purchase.|$|E

50|$|Ius in re, or jus in re, under civil law, more {{commonly}} referred to as a real right or right in rem, is a right in property, known as an interest under common law. A real right vests in a person with respect to property, inherent in his relation to it, and is good against the world (<b>erga</b> <b>omnes).</b> The primary real right is ownership (dominium) (freehold, leasehold, commonhold). Whether possession (possessio) is recognized as a real right, or merely as a source of certain powers and actions, depends on the legal system at hand. Subordinate or limited real rights generally refer to encumbrances, rights of use and security interests. The term right in rem is derived from the action given to its holder, an actio in rem. In Latin grammar the action against the thing demands a fourth case. The underlying right itself, Ius in re, has a fifth case, as the right rests on, or burdens, the thing. By mistake the common law terminology now uses the fourth case for describing the right itself. Compare jus ad rem.|$|E
5000|$|The only actual {{extension}} of [...] "hostis humani generis" [...] blessed by courts of {{law has been}} its extension to torturers.

Peña-Irala, 630 F.2d 876, the United States 2nd Circuit Court ruled that it could exercise jurisdiction over agents of the Government of Paraguay (in their individual capacity) who were found to have committed the crime of torture against a Paraguayan citizen, using its jurisdiction under the Offenses Clause of the Constitution of the United States, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and customary international law. In deciding this, the court famously stated that [...] "Indeed, for purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before him hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind." [...] This usage of the term hostis humani generis has been reinforced by the ruling of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the conviction of a torturer in Prosecutor v.

5000|$|After {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia in 1991, the name of Macedonia became {{the object of a}} dispute between Greece and the newly {{independent}} Republic of Macedonia. In the south, the Republic of Macedonia borders the region of Greek Macedonia, which administratively is split into three peripheries (one of them comprising both Western Thrace and a part of Greek Macedonia). Citing historical and territorial concerns resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient kingdom of Macedon which falls within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposes the use of the name [...] "Macedonia" [...] by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier, supporting a compound name (such as [...] "Northern Macedonia") for use by all and for all purposes (<b>erga</b> <b>omnes).</b> As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians, unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects {{to the use of the}} term [...] "Macedonian" [...] for the neighboring country's largest ethnic group. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of Greece's culture (such as Vergina Sun, a symbol associated with the ancient kingdom of Macedon, and Alexander the Great), and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which would include territories of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue of}} the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is not just a dispute over {{historical}} facts or symbols. It concerns the conduct of a UN member state, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which contravenes the fundamental principles of international law and order; specifically, respect for good neighbourly relations, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The name issue is thus a problem with regional and international dimensions, consisting in the promotion of irredentist and territorial ambitions {{on the part of the}} Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, mainly through the counterfeiting of history and usurpation of Greece’s national, historical and cultural heritage....The roots of the name issue go back to the mid-1940s, when, in the aftermath of the Second World War, Commander in Chief Tito separated from Serbia the region that had been known until that time as Vardar Banovina (today’s Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), giving it the status of a federal unit of the new Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia, renaming it, initially, the “People’s Republic of Macedonia”, and, later, the “Socialist Republic of Macedonia”.

The Greek government has proposed a realistic and viable settlement framework that is aimed at the finding of a definitive solution to the issue of the name.

Greece remains steadfastly dedicated to the negotiation process under UN special envoy Matthew Nimetz.Despite the existence of this serious issue, which impacts the relations between the two countries, Greece continues to have a prominent economic presence in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, contributing substantially and significantly to development, job creation, infrastructure construction, etc., in our neighbouring country.The resolution of the name issue will remove a major point of friction from the relations between the two countries and will allow for full realization of the great potential for cooperation between the two countries.|$|E
40|$|So-called {{obligations}} <b>erga</b> <b>omnes,</b> owed to {{the international}} community as a whole, including all States, now form part of positive international law. These obligations protect some of the most basic values of present-day international relations. Examples include the obligations not to commit genocide or torture, to uphold the most basic human rights, to respect the self-determination of peoples, and so on. However, there is little agreement as to what these obligations imply, how they have come about, and how to identify them. In the literature, at least, there is widespread agreement that obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are different in essence and in nature from obligations owed by one State to another State, so-called obligations inter partes. In turn, this —alleged— radical conceptual break severs obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> from a wealth of norms that exist in present-day, general international law, but whose origins lie farther back in time. This thesis attempts to reconcile obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> with obligations arising in classic, general international law. It explores {{what it means to be}} owed an obligation and how it came to pass that most obligations were owed inter partes. The particular way in which sovereignty came to be conceived and the furtherance of sovereignty, at the expense of other values, forms the pattern that gave rise to obligations inter partes. But even at that time, exceptions to this pattern existed which brought about obligations analogous to those owed <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> today. Relevant state practice will be analysed. If obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> could have been created in classic international law, it is unjustified to maintain that obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> represent so radical a break with the past. Obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are aggregates of bilateral, primary obligations. From this perspective, it is possible to identify these obligations, their consequences, and to discern their origins. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> {{norms are}} those that give {{third-party}} states, rather than just the victim, legal claims against states that violate them. This paper argues that ordinary two-party norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation injures only one state and that other states that seek to retaliate on that state’s behalf are likely using the violation as a pretext for predatory behavior. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation injures multiple states and that states {{have an incentive to}} free ride rather than retaliate against the violator. <b>Erga</b> <b>omnes</b> norms reduce the incentive to free ride {{but at the same time}} reintroduce the risk that some states will use a norm violation as a pretext for engaging in predatory behavior...|$|E
40|$|From the {{analytical}} viewpoint a norm can formally {{be regarded as}} a right-duty (or claim-obligation) relation (1) that regulates behaviour (action/inaction) (2) among subjects (3) in definite space (4) and time (5). Consequently, a legal order can be defined as a system of right-duty (or claim-obligation) relations that regulate behaviour (action/inaction) among subjects in definite space and are procedurally organised in the vertical and horizontal sense according to time. An iconic representation of these minimum necessary concepts allows switching from natural language to a purely formal representation of the legal system(s) (deontic network). Within this ‘geometrical’ frame, general principles (the ‘basis’) of (international) law can be conceived of as general obligations, i. e. obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> (towards everyone). Obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> (ties), indivisible or divisible because of their content, link a subject (node) to every other subject of international law, endowed with a correlative claim (s – s), so that the whole obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are matched by the whole claims <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> of all the subjects of international law. Indivisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are unavailable from the viewpoint of the power, so cogentes, breaches violate necessarily all the correlative claims, possibly enabling every subject to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as indivisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes,</b> the violation of which allows universal enforcement. Nevertheless, specifically by reason of the gravity of the breach, it is possible to split primary and secondary norms, conceiving of the sanction as a bilateral relation allowing solely reciprocal enforcement {{in the case of an}} infringement. Divisible obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are available from the viewpoint of the power, so dispositivae, breaches must be seen as relative, enabling only the subject(s) injured to invoke the responsibility and impose sanctions. Correspondingly, sanctions should be regarded as bilateral obligations, the infringement of which gives rise to reciprocal enforcement. Nevertheless, it is possible to figure out that specifically the gravity of the breach ‘unifies’ the primary divisible obligation, allowing universal invocation of the responsibility, so that the secondary obligation could be either bilateral or a general indivisible one, respectively permitting relative or absolute enforcement in the case of a breach...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the International Court of Justice {{declared}} that {{states have a}} duty to prevent genocide from occurring in another state since the prevention and punishment of genocide is a concern of every state and of the international community as a whole. The doctrine of the responsibility to protect will be analysed {{in the light of the}} <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> and <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> partes character of the rules embodied in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is argued that, even though there are differences between the Court’s decisions about genocide and the applicable regime regarding the consequences of serious violations of <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations, they are both consonant with the doctrine of the responsibility to protect since they are both inspired by the need to guarantee the protection of fundamental legal value...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{judicial}} enforcement by the International Court of Justice of <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations. While the concept of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> was enunciated {{for the first time}} in paras. 33 and 34 of the Barcelona Traction judgment, the main consequences of this kind of international obligations on the proceedings before the ICJ are still very controversial. By deeply analyzing ICJ’s jurisprudence since 1970, the paper tries to find answers to some very important questions: do all States, irrespective of individual injury, have standing to institute ICJ proceedings in the general interest in response to <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> breaches? Is it possible to configure a sort of actio popularis in the international legal order? Is the consent of states to ICJ jurisdiction always necessary? The authors admit <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> claims brought in defence of general interests of the international community. While not unequivocal, the Barcelona Traction dictum, as well as the successive jurisprudence of the Court, strongly supports this view. In any case, proceedings could only be brought against States that have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction. The paper also examines the question of the relationship between ‘injured State’ and ‘States other than an injured State’ as to the content of the claims which may be brought before the Court...|$|E
40|$|The {{decisions}} of the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) taken in the so called abstract control of constitutionality provoke a huge impact all over the country, for its effects reach everyone. Nonetheless, those effects are not applicable {{to everyone in the}} same way. Thus, some are compelled by the binding effect (âefeito vinculanteâ) &# 8213; like all the administrative organs and all the judges, barring the Supreme Court itself &# 8213;, while others &# 8213; such as the legislators, when exerting their legislative powers &# 8213; simply are not. On the other hand, everyone is bound by the res iudicata <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> effect, including the Supreme Court and the legislators. Furthermore, the self concept of binding effect (âefeito vinculanteâ) is not yet clear in the doctrine and in the jurisprudence. As a matter of fact, considering that even the Supreme Court has not outlined its range, the definition of binding effect remains quite mysterious. Nevertheless, a plain definition is proposed, based upon the constitutional text. Moreover, the objective and subjective limits of the binding effect are analyzed, as well as the differences with regard to the res iudicata <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> and to the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> efficacy (âeficÃcia erga omnesâ). It is also analyzed the possibility of manipulation, especially in time, {{of the effects of the}} Supreme Courtâs decisions in ADIn (direct action of unconstitutionality &# 8213; âaÃÃo direta de inconstitucionalidadeâ) and ADC (declaratory action of constitutionality &# 8213; âaÃÃo declaratÃria de constitucionalidadeâ), supported by the principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Finally, it is sustained the necessity of overriding the applicability of the binding effect and the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> efficacy in some exceptional situations, also based on the principles of proportionality and reasonableness. The use of the distinguishing technique is advocated. Some cases in which the Supreme Court itself and other Superior Courts did that are commented on and held as paradigmatic in order to guide the decisions all over the country in future analogous situationsAs decisÃes da Suprema Corte brasileira (STF) proferidas no controle abstrato de constitucionalidade provocam um enorme impacto em todo o paÃs, porquanto seus efeitos atingem a todos.

Assim, alguns sÃo sujeitos ao efeito vinculante &# 8213; como todos os ÃrgÃos administrativos e todos os juÃzes, tirante a prÃpria Suprema Corte &# 8213;, ao passo que outros &# 8213; como os legisladores, no exercÃcio de seu poder legiferante &# 8213; simplesmente nÃo o sÃo.

By employing the concept of toleration introduced by Judge Simma in his separate declaration in the ICJ s 2010 Advisory Opinion, {{the question is not whether}} countermeasures in the general interest are legal, but rather whether they are not illegal. Understood as a property of fundamental norms, instantiations of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> are more easily identified through the better-developed concept of jus cogens. The prohibitions on genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are all peremptory norms owed <b>erga</b> <b>omnes.</b> In addition, the prohibition on genocide entails a positive extra-territorial duty to prevent genocide and there are indications that the same applies to serious war crimes and crimes against humanity. Despite the International Law Commission s compromise solution in its 2001 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, existing State practice and opinio juris reveal a strong argument for the toleration of countermeasures by non-injured States in response to serious breaches of peremptory norms. Further, the legal regime regulating the measures and State practice do not lend strong support to the arguments against countermeasures in the general interest based on the risks of abuse inherent in self-assertion. Lastly, although international law contains a framework for extending countermeasures beyond principally responsible States, this extension reveals some legitimacy concerns for countermeasures by non-injured States in the general interest. The second sub-question of the thesis deals with the relationship between individual measures and collective enforcement of obligations <b>erga</b> <b>omnes.</b> It examines enforcement through the United Nations (UN) in light of the Responsibility to Protect policy developed since the 2005 World Summit. In this respect, the public law ideal of collective enforcement of community norms leaves a residual role for individual measures. Furthermore, in cases where there is need to coordinate responses or secure legitimacy, the UN General Assembly is competent to assume a more prominent role in recommending individual countermeasures by non-injured States...|$|E
40|$|LL. D. Millions {{of human}} {{lives have been}} {{affected}} by gross human rights violations since 1945. Genocide and crimes against humanity have been perpetrated repeatedly against civilians despite the vow after the Holocaust that such atrocities would “never again” occur. The Holocaust acts were not criminalised as “genocide” in the London Charter, but as “persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds” under the broader international crime of “crimes against humanity”. “Genocide” was criminalised on 9 December 1948 by the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by the United Nations General Assembly. Two main obligations were imposed on signatory states by Article I of the Genocide Convention, namely to prevent the commission of the international crime of genocide, and the obligation to punish the perpetrators of such a crime. Both genocide and crimes against humanity form part of the “most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”, which are also gross human rights violations. It is of interest to all states of the international community to prevent the commission of these gross human rights violations and to prosecute perpetrators. The prohibition of the international crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity is <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> in nature. The research objective of this doctoral thesis is to analyse the causes for the repeated failure of the international community to fulfil the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligation to prevent and prosecute gross human rights violations. This endeavour is furthermore aimed at formulating recommendations that will enhance future compliance with the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligation in accordance with the international legal developments that will form {{the subject matter of the}} thesis. The thesis consists of five parts. Part 1 is an introduction in which the research objective and aims of the thesis are explained and demarcated, as well as the issues focused upon. Core legal concepts, terms and notions explained in Part 1 include “gross human rightsviolations”, “erga omnes obligation”, “jus cogens norms”, “customary international law”, “states upon whom the <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations to prevent and prosecute gross human rights violations are imposed”, “the obligation to prevent”, “the obligation to prosecute”, “state responsibility”, “individual criminal responsibility”, “state immunity”, and various other terms. Part 1 further explains the research methodology followed in the thesis and contains a brief overview of the parts and chapters...|$|E

40|$|For decades, general {{international}} law has recognized that international obligations {{can be divided into}} two types, i. e. bilateral obligations and multilateral obligations, according to their own legal nature. Today, multilateral obligations are furthermore divided into <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> obligations and <b>erga</b> <b>omnes</b> partes obligations. The former is the obligations owed to the international community as a whole and the latter is the obligations owed to a group of States for the protection of a collective interest of the group. Contrary to general {{international law}}, for a long time, WTO law has been silent regarding the legal nature of obligations imposed on their Member States. It would be easy to consider GATT obligations as bilateral, because trade is a transaction between two states; that is to say, trade is bilateral behavior. However, WTO law is not as simple as GATT. WTO law treats not only goods but also services, intellectual property rights and other technical or sanitary matters, so that it would covers a wide range of rights and obligations. This article clarifies the legal nature of obligations accruing to Member States under the actual WTO law on the basis of {{general international law}}...|$|E
