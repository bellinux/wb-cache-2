5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E

The placement of the Heterogynaidae is uncertain. The small subfamily Mellininae was not included in their analysis.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza. The tomb {{contained}} rich offerings of jadeite, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania {{invented a}} {{drilling}} process to extract oil from <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the earth. Drake's invention {{is credited with}} giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues {{such as the}} eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E

5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene that crystallized <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E
5|$|The storyline, {{which is}} largely {{faithful}} to the original television production, centres on {{the discovery of a}} mysterious object buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground. Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the human psyche.|$|E

5|$|The yucca, Yucca whipplei, is pollinated {{exclusively}} by Tegeticula maculata, a yucca moth {{that depends on}} the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Trajan, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of the Iazyges, led his legions into Dacia against King Decebalus, in the year 101. In order to cross the Danube with such a large army, Apollodorus of Damascus, the Romans' chief architect, created a bridge through the Iron Gates by cantilevering it from the sheer face of the Iron Gates. From this he created a great bridge with sixty piers that spanned the Danube. Trajan used this to strike <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> Dacia, forcing the king, Decebalus, to surrender and become a client king.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E

5|$|Following Kid, {{the group}} infiltrates Viper Manor {{on the night}} of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while {{unraveling}} the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Michael became Prince of Wallachia, he {{turned against the}} Ottoman Empire. The next year he joined the Christian {{alliance}} of European powers formed by Pope Clement VIII against the Turks, and signed treaties with his neighbours: Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania, Aron Tiranul of Moldavia and the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (see Holy League of Pope Clement VIII). He started a campaign against the Turks {{in the autumn of}} 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Brăila, Hârşova, and Silistra, while his Moldavian allies defeated the Turks in Iaşi and other parts of Moldavia. Mihai continued his attacks <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the Ottoman Empire, taking the forts of Nicopolis, Ribnic, and Chilia and even reaching as far as Adrianople.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 49% of {{diamonds}} originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant {{sources of the}} mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from <b>deep</b> <b>within</b> the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African paramilitary groups. The diamond supply chain is controlled by {{a limited number of}} powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world.|$|E
