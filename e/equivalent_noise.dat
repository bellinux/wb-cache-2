40|$|International audienceThe <b>equivalent</b> {{magnetic}} <b>noise</b> of the magnetoelectric (ME) {{layered composite}} sensors {{has been investigated}} for various modulation techniques. The ME thin film response to an electric modulation or a magnetic modulation can be sensed by using either a charge amplifier or a coil wound around the sample and then demodulated by a synchronous detector. The <b>equivalent</b> magnetic <b>noise</b> for these excitations methods has been compared. As expected, the low-frequency fluctuations can be lowered when the magnetoelectric sensor is operated in a modulation mode. Results show that these methods can give {{the same level of}} <b>equivalent</b> magnetic <b>noise</b> for a certain strain-excitation. In theory, mechanical noise appears as the only dominant noise source after the demodulation process {{in the case of a}} certain strong amplitude excitation carrier signal.

40|$|International audienceThe {{photopic}} motion sensitivity {{function of}} the energy-based motion system is band-pass peaking around 8 Hz. Using an external noise paradigm to factorize the sensitivity into <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise</b> and calculation efficiency, {{the present study investigated}} if the variation in photopic motion sensitivity as a {{function of the}} temporal frequency is due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise</b> (e. g., early temporal filtering) or calculation efficiency (ability to select and integrate motion). For various temporal frequencies, contrast thresholds for a direction discrimination task were measured in presence and absence of noise. Up to 15 Hz, the sensitivity variation was mainly due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise</b> and little variation in calculation efficiency was observed. The sensitivity fall-off at very high temporal frequencies (from 15 to 30 Hz) was due to a combination of a drop of calculation efficiency and a rise of <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise.</b> A control experiment in which an artificial temporal integration was applied to the stimulus showed that an early temporal filter (generally assumed to affect <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise,</b> not calculation efficiency) could impair both the calculation efficiency and <b>equivalent</b> input <b>noise</b> at very high temporal frequencies. We conclude that at the photopic luminance intensity tested, the variation of motion sensitivity {{as a function of the}} temporal frequency was mainly due to early temporal filtering, not to the ability to select and integrate motion. More specifically, we conclude that photopic motion sensitivity at high temporal frequencies is limited by internal noise occurring after the transduction process (i. e., neural noise), not by quantal noise resulting from the probabilistic absorption of photons by the photoreceptors as previously suggested...|$|R

50|$|When the {{temperature}} increases, the Young's modulus {{of the material}} used to fabricate the moving structure decreases. This will leads to the softening of the moving structure. Meanwhile, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity will increase with {{the temperature}} inducing an internal stress in the moving structure. These effects can result in the shift of the resonant frequency of the moving structure which is <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> for resonant frequency shift sensing and the voltage sensing as well. In addition, temperature rise will generate larger Johnson noise (affect the piezoresiative transduction) and also large mechanical fluctuation noise (affects the optical sensing). Therefore, advanced electronics for temperature effect compensation have to be used to improve the sensitivity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concepts}} of resolution and dynamic range {{tend to be}} somewhat subjective, depending on what the user is actually trying to do. But {{they also tend to}} be highly correlated with the total leakage, which is quantifiable. It is usually expressed as an equivalent bandwidth, B. It {{can be thought of as}} redistributing the DTFT into a rectangular shape with height equal to the spectral maximum and width B. [...] The more the leakage, the greater the bandwidth. It is sometimes called noise equivalent bandwidth or <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> bandwidth, because it is proportional to the average power that will be registered by each DFT bin when the input signal contains a random noise component (or is just random noise). A graph of the power spectrum, averaged over time, typically reveals a flat noise floor, caused by this effect. The height of the noise floor is proportional to B. So two different window functions can produce different noise floors.|$|E
5000|$|The total leakage of {{a window}} {{function}} is measured by a metric called <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> bandwidth (ENBW) or noise equivalent bandwidth (NEB). The best window in that regard is the simplest, called rectangular because of its flat top and vertical sides. Its spreading effect occurs mostly a factor of 10 to 100 below the amplitude of the original component. Unfortunately the spreading is very wide, which may mask important spectrum details at even lower levels. That prevents the rectangular window from being a popular choice. Non-rectangular window functions actually increase the total leakage, {{but they can also}} redistribute it to places where it does the least harm, depending on the application. Specifically, to different degrees they reduce the level of the spreading by increasing the high-level leakage in the near vicinity of the original component. In general, they control the trade-off between resolving comparable strength signals with similar frequencies or resolving disparate strength signals with dissimilar frequencies: one speaks of [...] "high resolution" [...] versus [...] "high dynamic range" [...] windows. And leakage near the original component is actually beneficial for a metric known as scalloping loss.|$|E

40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the noise as the equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a noise indicator is the maximum noise level of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the maximum noise level in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level and the maximum noise level. Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum noise level subtracted with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level. Furthermore, we control for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>noise</b> level in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the maximum noise level in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road.
