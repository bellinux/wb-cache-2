50|$|The {{indexation}} {{of government}} debt to inflation {{is related to}} transferring the inflation risk from depositors to the government {{in an attempt to}} reduce inflation. Some governments have ultimately subjected their short-term debt instruments to deindexation so their central bank could regain control of short-term interest rates from a monetary policy standpoint and be {{in a better position to}} fight inflation. Another objective of indexation, for certain governments with already low inflation rate, is to reduce their borrowing cost by paying lower interest rates to depositors in exchange for assuming inflation risk. Both the UK and the US have issued inflation indexed government bonds to reduce their borrowing costs. When governments such as the UK and the US issue both inflation indexed bonds and regular nominal bonds, it gives them precise information on <b>inflation</b> <b>expectation</b> by observing the difference in yields between the two types of bonds.

40|$|<b>Inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> play {{a crucial}} role in modern {{monetary}} policy, given their capacity to influence actual inflation and given their informative value on the central bank’s credibility with regard to safeguarding price stability. The risk of a de-anchoring of <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> in the wake of soaring energy and commodity prices figured among the key motivations for international hikes in official interest rates between 2007 and mid- 2008. But also the recent abrupt decline in headline inflation – driven by the collapse in energy and commodity prices as well as the sharp global recession – may bear the risk of affecting <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations,</b> this time downward. An appropriate conceptualization and measurement – in real time – of <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> is therefore essential for successful monetary policy. Building on the current state of economic theory and central bank practice, this study addresses four questions: First, which agents’ or sectors’ <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> should be considered? Second, what time horizon of <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> is relevant for monetary policy decisions? Third, what are the relative merits and drawbacks of the various available measures of <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> in the light of the answers to the first two questions? Finally, how do shocks to <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> affect actual <b>inflation</b> in the euro area? The study finds, first, that to gauge future risks for inflation and to assess central bank credibility comprehensively across various constituencies, it would be desirable to capture wage and price setters’ <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> better than so far. Second, besides the muchquoted long-term <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations,</b> also medium-term <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> (beyond one and below five years) should be given due consideration. Third, the available empirical measures of <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> only partly fit these conceptual requirements. Given the important limitations of the proxy measures currently available in the euro area, we recommend further research and improving data coverage. Finally, the study confirms empirically that shocks to expected inflation account for a considerable part of actual inflation dynamics. The influence is stronger for financial marketbased measures and for forecasters’ <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations</b> than for measures based on consumer expectations. This may also reflect the longer time-horizon of these indicators. Thus, expectation shocks may represent a serious risk for price stability. <b>inflation</b> <b>expectations,</b> monetary policy, heterogeneity, VAR models...|$|R
