40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evolving typology of frames – filters of sense-making – to unpack how actors are interpreting {{and responding to}} the issue of environmental migration. We use frame analysis to draw attention to how a variety of actors define the boundaries of environmental migration, both intentionally and unintentionally, and how this generates interpretations and directions for policy action. In particular, we identify and discuss four unique framings of the <b>environmental</b> <b>migrant</b> notable in popular policy and academic debate: victims, security threats, adaptive agents and political subjects. Although not always consistently deployed by the same actors, and often hybridised, we argue that the four framings highlight different political, ideological and practical beliefs associated with particular interests and normative assumptions. The paper uses a qualitative, interpretive approach suited to understanding over-arching, macrocultural frames. We explore how key actors produce, communicate and legitimise each framing, discuss the ramifications of such and highlight major apparent critiques. We conclude that despite the four framings identified by us, scope of debate concerning environmental migration is marked by continued dynamism. Within this context, the frame perspective may stimulate greater reflexivity about assumptions and blindspots about this complex phenomenon to ground debate and action, in an arena that often relies on high-level and abstract language...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} intersections of militarism, climate change, and environmental justice in U. S. literature {{and popular culture}} {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The project identifies different mechanisms enacting environmental military violence through discursive analysis of literary and cultural texts, and considers the ideas, values, and beliefs that support environmental military violence. In each chapter I trace a different dynamic of environmental violence structured through the logics of U. S. counterinsurgency theory by examining what I call “narrative political ecologies”—cultural texts that center concerns of ecology and broadly defined political economy. Chapter I establishes the stakes and questions of the dissertation. The next two chapters investigate the dynamics of environmental violence depicted within narrative political ecologies. Chapter II investigates how eruptive interpersonal violence secures more insidious, hidden forms of slow environmental violence in Héctor Tobar’s The Tattooed Soldier. Chapter III considers the U. S. -Mexico Borderlands and the environmental military violence responsible for the deaths of undocumented migrants by examining Luis Alberto Urrea’s The Devil’s Highway and the Electronic Disturbance Theater’s Transborder Immigrant Tool. Chapter IV turns to potential f wars and conflicts that may be caused by climate change as they have been depicted in speculative fiction. In novels depicting climate migrants, such as Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (2014), I show that even politically progressive, intersectional approaches to environmental endangerment naturalize conflict and occlude dialogic solutions to environmental change. The final chapter traces how the environmental refugee has become a paradigmatic figure in climate change discourse, particularly the aspects of this discourse where issues of national security are articulated. At the center of these texts is the figure of the migrant and narratives of migrations, and I argue that the figure of the <b>environmental</b> <b>migrant</b> offers a privileged vantage on the constitutive forces of the Anthropocene. The dissertation identifies the specific literary and rhetorical techniques that authors use to contest environmental militarization and expand the U. S. public’s capacity to creatively and compassionately reason around increased flows of environmental migrants— issues of vital importance for humane climate change adaptation...|$|E

40|$|Migration {{is likely}} to be a key factor linking climate change and conflict. However, our {{understanding}} of the factors behind and consequences of migration is surprisingly limited. We take this shortcoming as a motivation for our research and study the relationship between environmental migration and conflict at the micro level. In particular, we focus on <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants?</b> conflict perceptions to shed new theoretical and empirical light on this debate. We contend that variation in migrants? conflict perception can be explained by the type of environmental event people experienced in their former home, i. e., gradual, long-term or sudden onset, short-term environmental changes. We examine and further develop this argument before quantitatively analyzing newly collected micro-level data on intra-state migration from five developing countries. The results emphasize that migrants who suffered from gradual, long-term environmental events in their former homes are more likely to perceive conflict in their new location than those having experienced sudden, short - term environmental events. These findings are therefore in line with our theoretical argument that <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants</b> who suffer to a large degree from environmentally induced grievances, are ultimately more likely to perceive conflict and challenges in their new homes...|$|R

The strengths and weaknesses of policy and institutional capacity in maintaining livelihoods in relation to migration is also explored. Given the vulnerabilities of the landless in Bangladesh in perspective of expected climate change the policies of the government of Bangladesh acknowledges environmental migration as an issue, but the policies or the institutional capacity is not adequate to provide support to the vulnerable to migrate to the urban areas. However, the government of Bangladesh is prepared to provide livelihood support to the vulnerable in their place of origin. Therefore, choices of the most vulnerable are not given significance in some of the current governance measures which lowers resilience and increases vulnerability...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the grand}} {{questions}} for research on the impacts of climate change is whether people can rely on migration to safeguard progress towards development even while experiencing severe environmental hardship. This is the ‘migration as adaptation’ hypothesis. Labour migration theory proposes assumptions {{about the use of}} migration by people faced with economic uncertainty and limited access to capital to raise standards of development. This paper asks how environmental stress affects labour migration, and evaluates the labour migration arising from a spectrum of ecological stress, from increasingly variable precipitation to catastrophic flooding in Honduras and Malawi. Evidence suggests that environmental stress changes the nature of labour migration. New environmental forms of mobility do not take forms predicted by labour migration theory; migrations are not made with the purpose of exploiting economic opportunities; they do not take place on the basis of rational choice, particularly as displaced persons are frequently emotionally stressed; and among <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants</b> are those less {{likely to be able to}} absorb costs and extract benefits associated with migration (i. e. the unwell, the elderly or the unskilled).

40|$|Environmental {{migration}} is often presented {{as one of}} the gravest consequences of environmental disruptions – climate change in particular, and is already a reality {{in many parts of the}} world. Yet the protection of these migrants is not adequately addressed in the international normative frameworks on migration. As a result, a growing number of scholars and advocacy groups have sought to create a special convention and/or an ad hoc status for these migrants, while others have contended that such a legal status is not the answer. As a result, the protection of <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants</b> is currently the subject of vigorous debates amongst scholars and policy-makers, and no clear solution is yet in sight. Research however has little considered the debates that surrounded the protection of those displaced within their countries (IDPs) in the 1990 s. Both phenomena have sometimes overlapped, especially as environmental displacement is often internal. Yet, the debate on IDPs has had some significant success, in particular, the adoption of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement in 1998, and the signature of the Organization for African Unity’s Kampala Convention in 2009. This article argues that important lessons can be drawn from the protection of IDPs in order to inform the current debates on the protection of <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants,</b> as the political contexts and policy challenges associated with both crises of the migration regime are often similar.

40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Environmentally induced {{migration}} {{has been}} a contentious topic {{over the last two}} decades. Estimates show that over 30 million people worldwide are annually forced to migrate due to serious environmental degradation, natural disasters and depletion of natural resources. Thus the environment is irrefutably changing, and clear linkages can be drawn between environmental change and human mobility. Africa‘s developing status and its vulnerability in the context of environmental shocks compels research on prospective impacts and outcomes in order to develop proper mitigation and adaptation strategies, especially in Southern African Development Community (SADC) where the likelihood of protection measures being successfully implemented is relatively low. This dissertation is aimed at providing the reader with a detailed analysis of the regional normative framework regulating the issue of environmentally induced migration in SADC. Because <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants</b> are not considered to be ―refugees‖ in international law and on account of the fact that many policy makers and practitioners have their reservations as regards even acknowledging the existence of <b>environmental</b> <b>migrants,</b> protection and regulation in this regard is understandably lacking. A comprehensive framework is nonetheless required to regulate this phenomenon as it prompts serious security and sovereignty concerns. Until quite recently, most African countries had not even put in place national migration policies. Although many states have policies in place now, most have not yet been fully and effectively implemented. The normative framework governing specifically environmentally induced migration in SADC similarly renders rather disappointing results. Most of the applicable instruments do not directly raise the issue and the provisions indirectly touching upon the subject matter are subject to interpretation. A binding protocol must therefore be adopted by SADC Member States embracing elements contained in the instruments comprising the current framework. Such a protocol will however have to be liberal enough to acknowledge and provide for environmentally induced migration in its entirety whilst conservative enough so as not to undermine protection regimes for refugees in the true sense of the word. Conflicting interests and sovereignty considerations will, however, undoubtedly continue to hinder progress in this regard. The way forward is therefore away from ultimate sovereignty preservation and toward a regionalised approach where human rights no longer take a backseat. Master...|$|R
