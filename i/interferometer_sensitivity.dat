Contrary to homodyne detection, a heterodyne readout scheme can simultaneously measure more than one quadrature of the output field, providing an additional way of optimizing the <b>interferometer</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> but at the price of additional noise. Our analysis provides the framework needed to evaluate whether a homodyne or heterodyne readout scheme is more optimal for second generation interferometers from an astrophysical point of view.

40|$|We propose an {{enhanced}} optical interferometer based on tailored non-classical light generated by nonlinear dynamics and projective measurements in a three-level atom cavity QED system. A coherent {{state in the}} cavity becomes dynamically entangled with two ground states of the atom and is transformed to a macroscopic superposition state via a projective measurement on the atom. We show that the resulting highly non-classical state can improve interferometric precision measurements well beyond the shot-noise limit once combined with a classical laser pulse at the input of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. For a practical implementation, we identify an efficient phase shift estimation scheme based on the counting of photons at the interferometer output.

We consider atomic interferometers based on two-photon transitions (Raman transitions or Bragg pulses). Starting from the exact analytical phase shift formula obtained from the atom optics ABCD formalism, we use a power series expansion in time {{of the position of}} the atomic wave packet with respect to the initial condition. The result of this expansion leads to a formulation of the interferometer phase shift where the leading coefficient in the phase terms up to T^k dependences (k >= 0) in the time separation T between pulses, can be simply expressed in terms of a product between a Vandermonde matrix, and a vector characterizing the two-photon pulse sequence of the interferometer. This simple coefficient dependence of the phase shift reflects very well the atom <b>interferometer's</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to a specific inertial field in the presence of multiple gravito-inertial effects. Consequently,we show that this formulation is well suited when looking for selective atomic sensors of accelerations, rotations, or photon recoil only, which can be obtained by simply zeroing some specific coefficients.
