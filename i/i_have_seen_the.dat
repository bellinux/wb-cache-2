[...] In late November 2014, Sajid Nadiadwala confirmed that he would direct the film's Hindi remake with Kapoor as the lead. When asked by Subhash K. Jha the reason for not directing the Hindi remake, Rajamouli said [...] "I've already spent two {{years of my life}} on it. I’d rather make something else. Magadheera was my toughest film to make. Very tiring." [...] By June 2016, Kapoor was no longer part of the Hindi remake. The film was dubbed in Hindi under the same name by Goldmines Movies and released in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Anglican Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity {{is known}} as the Ship of the Fens, a name {{inspired}} by the distant views of its towers, which dominate the low-lying wetlands known as [...] "The Fens". The diocese of Ely was created in 1108 out of the see of Lincoln, and a year later the bishopric of Ely was founded. Construction of the cathedral was begun by William the Conqueror in 1083, with it finally opening in 1189 after 116 years. On 22February 1322 it suffered the collapse of the crossing, which was rebuilt as an octagon. The cathedral was completed in 1351. John Wesley wrote of his 22November 1774 visit to Ely that [...] "the cathedral, [...] {{one of the most beautiful}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> western tower is exceedingly grand, and the nave of an amazing height".|$|E
500|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{composition}} and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that [...] "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." [...] By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word [...] "Victorian" [...] had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) {{was one of the few}} 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Candaules was {{exhibited}} Etty, needled by repeated {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, which was {{seen by many as}} a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 Vanity Fair was able to comment that [...] "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." ...|$|E
500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have {{never seen such a}} dancer, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep leaning over a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E

[...] Now I can see a new dawn. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun.

2500|$|Assi {{became a}} disciple of R. Johanan, and so {{distinguished}} himself that R. Eleazar called him [...] "the prodigy of the age" [...] ("mofet ha-dor"; Hul. 103b), {{and as such}} legend pictures him. Concerning the futile longings of many {{to communicate with the}} departed spirit of R. Hiya the Great, legend relates that R. Jose fasted eighty days in order that a glimpse of R. Hiya might be granted him. Finally the spirit of the departed appeared, but the sight so affected R. Jose that his hands became palsied and his eyes dim. [...] "Nor must you infer from this," [...] the narrator continues, [...] "that R. Josah was an unimportant individual. Once a weaver came to R. Johanan and said, 'In a dream <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> skies fall, but one of thy disciples held them up.' When asked whether he knew that disciple, the weaver replied that {{he would be able to}} recognize him. R. Johanan thereupon had all his disciples pass before the weaver, who pointed to R. Josah as the miraculous agent" [...] (Yer. Kil. ix. 32b; Eccl. R. ix. 10). Another adventure, which, however, bears the impress of fact, is related of him, wherein he was once abducted in a riot and given up as lost, but R. Simon ben Lakish, the former gladiator, rescued him at the risk of his own life (Yer. Ter. viii. 46b).|$|E
2500|$|Lone Wolf {{was one of}} {{the first}} Indian artists to paint other Indians, and Indian subjects. He was also one of the first Indian artists to be academically trained in art. [...] He was known for both his {{painting}} and sculpting skills. He played a [...] "significant role" [...] in capturing the events of the American West during the latter part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s. He had personal experience, as well as his tribe's personal knowledge of people and events. He was the first Indian to achieve national recognition as an artist, creating over 500 paintings. He was influenced and encouraged by Thomas Moran, who he met during his time wrangling at the Grand Canyon, and his style has been compared to that of Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell. Russell also encouraged and instructed Lone Wolf in his early career. Lone Wolf had his first solo show in Los Angeles in 1917. The headline in the Los Angeles Times about the exhibition read, [...] "Vance Thompson Discovers Wonderful Indian Artist, An Artist With a Vision." [...] In that article, Vance Thompson said of Lone Wolf, [...] "The message he has to give is his own; and already he has shaped – if he has not perfected – a distinct, individual and interesting technique." [...] He went to say, [...] "It is a rare thing to discover an artist. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> young painters pass in droves through the schools and salons of Paris, and in 20 years I can claim to have been the discoverer of only one great artist.
