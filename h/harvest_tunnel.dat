40|$|ObjectiveWe {{describe}} and report our results using endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) for lower extremity arterial bypass procedures, following {{the implementation of}} technical modifications specific to patients undergoing limb salvage procedures. MethodsWe underwent training in EVH, followed by implementation of the technique in patients requiring limb salvage for lower extremity ischemia and aneurysms. After technical modifications in the technique were developed for limb salvage, we reviewed our experience in all patients who underwent minimally invasive distal bypass with EVH. ResultsTechnical modifications include limited arterial dissection before vein harvest, the use of proximal and distal leg incisions for both exposure of arterial vessels and saphenous vein harvest, improved hemostasis techniques in the vein graft tunnel, avoidance of compression wraps to the ipsilateral <b>harvest</b> <b>tunnel,</b> complete removal of the vein with either reversed or nonreversed graft placement, {{and use of the}} endoscopic tunnel for conduit placement. Thirteen patients (14 limbs) have undergone minimally invasive distal bypass since technical modifications were implemented. Indications for EVH were rest pain (n = 12; 85. 7 %) and tissue loss (n = 8; 57. 1 %). Veins harvested were the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (n = 10; 71. 4 %), contralateral great saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %), and short saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %). No venous injuries occurred during endoscopic harvest, and all were used for bypass. Thirty-day primary and primary assisted patency rates were 85. 7 % and 92. 9 %, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 100 %. Two patients developed postoperative hematomas, one early and one late, as a result of anticoagulation for cardiac comorbidities. Both patients required reoperation for successful re-establishment of patency. There were no perioperative deaths and no postoperative wound infections or complications. Two patients required a later prosthetic bypass, and two required a vein graft angioplasty. Complete wound healing was achieved in 75 % of patients with preoperative tissue loss. ConclusionsTechnical modifications in endoscopic saphenous vein harvest techniques facilitate their use in lower extremity limb salvage procedures. Vascular surgeons should become familiar with these techniques to minimize vein harvest wound complications and extend the options for limb salvage conduits, including use of both the ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous vein and the short saphenous vein. Meticulous hemostasis within the tunnel after endoscopic conduit harvest and avoidance of postoperative anticoagulation should help to prevent postoperative hematoma formation and early graft occlusion...|$|E
30|$|The {{facial artery}} was easily {{identified}} and preserved with a Doppler probe. Without a 2 -team approach, the flap was easily <b>harvested</b> and <b>tunneled</b> submandibularly on the lingual {{side of the}} mandible and finally transposed to the defect site and sutured. In Fig.  4 (bottom left), the flap showed some degree of venous congestion immediate postoperatively, but became resolved {{in a few days}} with adequate venous drainage provided by submucosal plexus [13]. The donor site was covered with buccal fat pad advancement. As seen in Fig.  4 (bottom right), the flap shows an excellent color match with recipient tissue.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Proximal, {{posterior}} thigh wounds from oncologic or traumatic defects can {{be difficult}} wounds to reconstruct if local flap options have been sacrificed during the trauma or oncologic resection. Free flap options to cover these defects are also difficult {{because of the lack}} of convenient recipient vessels in the region. The authors present 2 cases (oncologic and traumatic) wherein a myocutaneous anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap was <b>harvested</b> and <b>tunneled</b> from the anterior muscle compartment to the posterior muscle compartment of the thigh through a medially based transmuscular tunnel, decreasing the required pedicle distance to the wound. This technique of transmuscular tunneling of the ALT flap expands the indications and utility of the ALT flap to cover posterior thigh wounds...|$|R

40|$|Article in press"; "Published online: November 27, 2017 "Patellar tendon {{ruptures}} {{can lead}} to significant functional deficiency of the extensor mechanism of the knee. These injuries, because of their inherent nature and associated complications, may require a complex treatment and remains a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. Current surgical techniques present significant complications, including patellar fracture, damage to patellar articular cartilage, and abnormal patella height. This note describes a surgical technique to provide an additional reinforcement to the patellar tendon repair with a semitendinous autograft, without the necessity to perform any transosseous tunnels at the patella bone. First, the patellar tendon is repaired with an end-to-end technique and the semitendinous tendon is <b>harvested.</b> A transosseous <b>tunnel</b> at the tibial tubercle is drilled and 2 rents are made, both medial and lateral to the retinaculum {{at the level of}} the intermedial segment of the patella close to the patellar margin. The graft is passed through the tunnel and rents in a U-shaped form. The graft is sutured along the length of the patellar tendon on both margins in tension at 30 of knee flexion. Fluoroscopy imaging is performed to assess the patella height. This technique provides a significant augmentation of patellar tendon, avoiding the potential patella bone tunnel complications. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|A variância associada à produção em plantas com colheitas múltiplas nem sempre é homogênea, o que compromete a precisão experimental. Com o objetivo de identificar o comportamento da média e da variância da massa dos frutos de abobrinha-italiana (Curcubita pepo) com o passar das colheitas, entre as linhas de cultivo dentro de cada colheita e entre colheitas, e verificar a interferência de diferentes manejos nesse comportamento, conduziu-se um trabalho nas estações sazonais inverno-primavera (I/P) e verão-outono (V/O) 2004 / 2005. O experimento foi conduzido em dois túneis (T 1 e T 2), com três linhas de 25 plantas por túnel, com a {{cultivar}} Caserta. Em T 1 utilizou-se irrigação por gotejamento, com mulching sobre os camalhões e menor aplicação de biocidas que em T 2. Em T 2 utilizou-se irrigação por aspersores, colocados a 1, 8 m de altura, sem mulching sobre os camalhões. Aplicou-se o teste de Bartlett entre as seis variâncias das linhas de cultivo dentro de cada colheita e entre as variâncias médias das seis linhas para verificar a homogeneidade entre colheitas em cada estação de cultivo. Para comparação das médias de produção de cada linha de cultivo, em cada colheita, dentro de cada túnel, e entre linhas de cultivo, com a mesma posição nos túneis, foi aplicado o teste t. Na estação V/O, as variâncias foram homogêneas em duas das onze colheitas e, na estação I/P, em dez das treze colheitas, sendo que em ambas as estações houve maior homogeneidade das variâncias na primeira metade do ciclo. Na estação V/O, as variâncias em T 1 foram, de modo geral, menores em todo o ciclo. Nas duas estações houve heterogeneidade na variância entre colheitas. Na estação V/O, ocorreram diferenças significativas em seis e três colheitas, respectivamente em T 1 e T 2, com as médias de produção atingindo 481, 0 em T 1 e 454, 0 g planta- 1 em T 2. Na estação I/P ocorreram diferenças de produção na primeira (T 1) e quarta e quinta colheitas (T 2), com as médias atingindo 598, 2 (T 1) e 597, 4 g planta- 1 (T 2). The variance {{associated to}} the production of plants with multiple harvests is not always homogeneous, what compromises the experimental precision. To address this issue, in this work we identified (1) the behavior of the means and variance for fruit mass in zucchini (Curcubita pepo) along harvests, between planting rows within and betweens harvests, and (2) the interference of different crop managements over these parameters. The experiment was carried out in two seasons, winter-spring (I/P) and summer-autumn (V/O), 2004 / 2005, using cultivar Caserta and two plastic tunnels (T 1 and T 2), with three 25 -plant rows in each tunnel. In T 1, drip irrigation was used, combined with mulching over the ridges, and less biocide spraying than in T 2. In T 2, sprinkler irrigation was used, placed 1, 8 m height, without mulching. The Bartlett test was applied to the six planting row variances within each harvest and to the average variance of each row to check the homogeneity between harvests in each crop season. The t test was used to compare the production means in each planting row, in each <b>harvest,</b> in each <b>tunnel,</b> and also between planting rows, for plants with the same position in the tunnel. In the V/O season, variances were homogeneous in two out of the eleven harvests. In season I/P, variances were homogeneous in ten of the thirteen harvests. In both seasons, variance homogeneity was higher {{in the first half of}} the cycle. In V/O, variances in T 1 were in general smaller than in T 2 in the whole cycle. In both seasons there was variance heterogeneity between harvests. In V/O, significant differences were observed in six and three harvests, respectively in T 1 and T 2, with production means reaching 481. 0 and 454. 0 g plant- 1 T 1 and T 2, respectively. In I/P, significant differences were observed in the first (T 1) and fourth and fifth harvests (T 2), with the means for fruit mass reaching 598. 2 (T 1) and 597. 4 g plant- 1 (T 2) ...|$|R
