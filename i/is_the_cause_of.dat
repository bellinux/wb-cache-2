5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> creation and {{the liberation of}} Jiva. Avidya Maya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is {{under the control of}} Maya. Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E

5|$|HIV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the {{spectrum}} of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|Pharyngitis, {{the broader}} {{category}} into which Streptococcal pharyngitis falls, is diagnosed in 11 million people {{annually in the}} United States. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% in adults. Cases usually occur in late winter and early spring.|$|E

5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905.

5|$|Seizures {{result in}} direct {{economic}} costs {{of about one}} billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy resulted in economic costs in Europe of around 15.5 billion Euros in 2004. In India epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of 1.7billion USD or 0.5% of the GDP. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily {{formed from}} its {{constituent}} elements and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It {{may also be}} formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.|$|E

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in part due to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts {{can be added to}} table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the land}} of Soleanna, Sonic and his sidekick Tails protect Princess Elise from her {{kidnapper}} Doctor Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a post-apocalyptic future ravaged by a devilish monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.|$|E

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{also ordered}} the {{destruction}} of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, {{to make way for the}} construction of a new, larger cathedral, the current Romanesque-style Durham Cathedral. The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093. However, St-Calais' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this probably <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham's comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works. There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.|$|E
5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
