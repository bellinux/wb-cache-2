5|$|The furnace {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished. The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E

25|$|The {{line from}} Alburtis to the now-derelict {{furnaces}} at Lock Ridge remained {{in place to}} haul <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> until 1959, when it was abandoned. Otherwise, the line remained largely intact until after passing to Conrail. The connection in West Catasauqua with the Lehigh and New England Railroad (formerly the Crane Iron Company tracks) had been abandoned in 1961. Anticipating the abandonment of the former Lehigh Valley main line in February 1982, leaving only the moribund Ironton Railroad connection, the line east of Seiple was abandoned on December 21, 1981. The remainder survived the breakup of Conrail to become the Norfolk Southern C Secondary. It is operated as a branch line from Alburtis, serving a number of industrial customers in the Chapman area.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slag,</b> and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).|$|E
25|$|Type V is used where sulfate {{resistance}} is important. Its typical compound composition is: 38% (C3S), 43% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 9% (C4AF), 1.9% MgO, 1.8% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. This cement {{has a very}} low (C3A) composition which accounts for its high sulfate resistance. The maximum content of (C3A) allowed is 5% for type V Portland cement. Another limitation is that the (C4AF) + 2(C3A) composition cannot exceed 20%. This type is used in concrete {{to be exposed to}} alkali soil and ground water sulfates which react with (C3A) causing disruptive expansion. It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada. As with type IV, type V Portland cement has mainly been supplanted by the use of ordinary cement with added ground granulated blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> or tertiary blended cements containing slag and fly ash.|$|E

40|$|The viscosities of high alumina blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were {{experimentally}} {{determined by}} the rotating cylinder method using the Brookfield digital viscometer model LVDV-II+ pro.

25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slag,</b> a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the stock}} of the Catasauqua & Fogelsville was bought by the Reading in 1890, as iron ore from the Mesabi Range began to put {{pressure}} on local iron mining operations. It was leased to the Reading on December 8, 1893. Between 1916 and 1919, <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> was dumped under the Jordan Creek high bridge so that it could be replaced by a fill and culvert. Iron ore traffic continued to decline, and the local mines had all been shut down by the end of World War I. The mine branches remained in place, derelict, until the 1940s, when the three spurs and the main line south of Lock Ridge were abandoned. The Catasauqua and Fogelsville was formally merged into the Reading on August 10, 1944, probably to simplify the corporate structure of that railroad and to save on taxes, as with a series of other mergers the next year.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E

25|$|With {{dreams of}} {{expansion}} towards Huntingdon long gone, the branch to Pine Grove Mills was removed in 1919. However, a new opportunity to lengthen the railroad would arrive. In 1927, the PRR applied {{to abandon its}} little-used Fairbrook Branch. The Bellefonte Central, {{with the blessing of}} the Interstate Commerce Commission, bought the line from Fairbrook to Stover, and obtained trackage rights from Stover into Tyrone. A new line was built from Struble to Fairbrook (more direct than the roundabout and now abandoned route via Scotia), and service to Tyrone began in 1930. The object of the purchase was to send freight directly to the PRR main line at Tyrone, bypassing the circuitous route via Bellefonte. Furthermore, Professor Ernest L. Nixon (uncle of Richard Nixon) owned a large potato farm near Fairbrook and planned to turn the area into a major potato-growing region. Other traffic would include lumber, clay, and <b>furnace</b> <b>slag.</b> However, the resentful PRR refused to supply cars at Tyrone, and gave the same rate for interchange at Tyrone as at Bellefonte. With no rate differential to offset the costs of the longer run to Tyrone, it was uneconomical for the Bellefonte Central to interchange there. The stockholders brought in new management in the wake of this debacle, in 1933, and operations were suspended on the branch.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, viscosities and {{sulphide}} capacities of high alumina blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were investigated. The systems investigated were four component CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 quaternary system, CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 and CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -CaF 2 quinary systems. Viscosities of high alumina blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were experimentally {{determined by the}} rotating cylinder method using Brookfield digital viscometer model LVDV-II+ pro. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1573 - 1873 K. The effects of temperature, basicity, TiO 2, CaF 2 and silica activity of slags on viscosity were studied. Viscosity decreases with basicity for high alumina blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> with increase in basicity and CaF 2. At higher basicity (~ 0. 8), slag viscosity decreases even with small amount of TiO 2 (~ 2 %) addition in the slag. With increase in silica activity {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 0. 4,viscosity of slag increases and the increase is steeper below liquidus temperature. Sulphide capacity of the slag was measured using gas-slag equlibria. The liquid slag was equilibrated with Ar-CO-CO 2 -SO 2 gas mixture. The slag systems studied were the same {{as in the case of}} viscosity measurements. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1773 to 1873 K. Effect of temperature, basicity, MgO,TiO 2 and CaF 2 contents of slags on sulphide capacity were studied. As expected, sulphide capacity was found to increase with increase in temperature and basicity. At higher experimental temperature (~ 1873 K) TiO 2 was found to decrease the sulphide capacity of slags. But, at lower temperature, there was no significant effect of TiO 2 on the sulphide capacity. Sulphide capacity increases with increase in MgO content of slag if MgO content is more than 5 %. Based on above experimental data, models were developed for estimation of viscosity and sulphide capacity of blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags.</b> These models were later on applied for designing the slags for achieving the optimum slag characteristics so that slag volume can be reduced. With the help of these models slag volume was reduced to the extent of 5 - 10 kg per ton hot metal and also silicon content of the hot metal was reduced by around 10 % with some improvement in slag viscosity and sulphide capacity of the slag.

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of blast <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> greatly affect the furnace productivity {{and the quality}} of hot metal produced. Viscosity is an important physical property of slags, strongly influenced by the chemical composition, structure and the temperature. Experimental measurement of slag viscosity requires high temperature equipment and is time consuming. Therefore, chemical parameters are used to identify trends in viscosity as function of chemical composition. Limited information is available for High Alumina Blast <b>Furnace</b> <b>Slags,</b> since much of the open literature deals with Low Alumina Slags, with alumina content less than 15 weight percentage. High Alumina slags (alumina content in the range of 15 % to 30 %) are predominantly encountered in Indian Blast Furnaces. It appears that these slags have higher viscosity and lower sulphide capacity than the low alumina slags. The effect of chemical composition / ionic structure on viscosity has been interpreted in this work, using the chemical parameter of optical basicity. Data reported in the literature have been used, along with the values of liquidus temperature, for high alumina slags. Three slag systems, i. e., CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO-TiO 2 have been considered in this work. The trends observed are discussed in the paper...|$|R
