We devised a viscoelastic mantle convection model for exploring cratonic stability in the stagnant lid regime. Our modeling results indicate that within the limitations of the stagnant lid approach, the application of a sufficiently high temperature-dependent viscosity ratio can provide for thermal craton stability for billions of years. The comparison between simulations with viscous and viscoelastic rheology indicates no significant influence of elasticity on craton stability.

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE), including deep {{vein thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism, is a common disease, with serious short- and long-term complications and a potential fatal outcome. Despite the knowledge of several inherited and acquired risk factors for VTE, still 30 - 50 % of the VTE events occur {{in the absence of}} obvious predisposing factors. Traditionally, arterial and venous thrombosis has been considered as separate disease entities with different pathology, epidemiology and treatments. However, recently this concept has been challenged, and a potential link between arterial cardiovascular disease and VTE has been suggested. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on the risk of VTE in a prospective population-based study. Subjects were recruited from the fourth survey of the Tromsø study, conducted in 1994 - 95. A total of 27 158 men and women, aged 25 - 97 years, participated. Incident VTE events were registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> through the end of follow-up, September 1, 2007. In summary, age, male gender, obesity, mean platelet volume and family history of myocardial infarction were identified as risk factors for venous thrombosis, which makes these factors, shared risk factors for both arterial and venous thrombosis. Other traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as serum lipid levels, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes were not associated with risk of VTE. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome had higher risk of VTE, but this relationship was essentially dependent on the presence of abdominal obesity. Taken together, these findings imply that traditional atherosclerotic risk factors are not shared by arterial and venous thrombosis, and suggest that common determinants for arterial and venous thrombosis are probably related to mechanisms of thrombus formation...|$|E
40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a common}} and potentially fatal disease, often occuring {{in the absence of}} obvious predisposing factors. Recent observational studies in selected populations have suggested a closer association between arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke) and VTE, two disease entities considered separate in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology and treatments. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relation between atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic risk factors and risk of incident VTE in a general population. 	We recruited study participants from the fourth survey of the Tromsø study, conducted in 1994 - 95. In this study, more than 27, 000 men and women, aged 25 - 97 years, participated, and a subset of participants (n= 9056) were also invited to a more extensive second visit. Incident VTE events were registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> until the end of follow up, and in papers 1 and 4, incident MI events were also registered. Furthermore, we performed a case-control study in which 20 participants with a previous history of unprovoked VTE and 20 healthy controls were subjected to a fat-tolerance test in order to examine the potential impact of postprandial lipemia on VTE risk. 	In a cause-specific hazards model, increasing age and obesity were shared risk factors for both MI and VTE. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, current smoking, higher levels of blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol) were associated with increased risk of MI, but not with VTE. Carotid atherosclerosis, measured by intima-media thickness and total plaque area, did also increase MI risk, while showing no association with VTE. Increasing levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) did not increase VTE risk. Subjects with a history of unprovoked VTE had similar lipoprotein subclasses size, distribution, and postprandial lipemia as healthy controls. 	Based on our findings, atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors {{do not appear to be}} associated with VTE risk.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether serum cystatin C was associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism among subjects with normal kidney function in a prospective population-based study. Design and Methods Cystatin C was measured in serum from 3251 men and women with normal kidney function, aged 25 – 84 years, who participated in the Tromsø study in 1994 – 1995. Normal kidney function was defined as a creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 and absence of microalbuminuria. Incident venous thromboembolism was registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> through to the end of follow-up, September 1, 2007. Cox-regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for venous thromboembolism. Results There were 83 incident venous thromboembolic events, of which 53 (63. 9 %) were provoked, during a median of 12. 3 years of follow-up. A one standard deviation (0. 11 mg/L) increase in serum cystatin C levels was associated with a 43 % (hazard ratio 1. 43; 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 – 1. 72) increased risk of total venous thromboembolism. Subjects with cystatin C levels in the top quartile (≥ 0. 87 mg/L) had a 2. 5 -fold (hazard ratio 2. 51; 95 % confidence interval 1. 27 – 4. 96) increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared to those with levels in the bottom quartile (≤ 0. 72 mg/L) in adjusted analysis. The risk estimates were even higher for provoked venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio 3. 11; 95 % confidence interval 1. 23 – 7. 86). Conclusions Serum cystatin C levels were associated with the risk of venous thromboembolism in subjects with normal kidney function.

Therefore we aimed to investigate the relation between hyperglycemia, thyroid function, vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and risk of future VTE in a general population. Our study participants were recruited from the Tromsø study (Tromsø 4; 1994 - 95, Tromsø 5; 2001 - 2, and/or Tromsø 6; 2007 - 8). Two of the papers are based on all three surveys, one paper is based on the fourth and fifth, and one on the fourth survey only. The fourth survey is the largest one, and a total of 27 158 men and women attended. A subset of participants (n= 9 056) were further invited to a more extensive second visit. In Tromsø 5 and 6 only subgroups of the municipality of Tromsø were invited. The overall attendance rate went from 77 % in Tromsø 4 to 66 % in Tromsø 6. Incident VTE events were registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> until the end of follow-up. Our findings suggest that hyperglycemia does not {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of VTE, and that obesity is a more important contributor to VTE in subjects with hyperglycemia. TSH within the normal range were not associated with risk of VTE, whereas low and high TSH were associated with a moderately increased risk of VTE. However, the prevalence and the population attributable risk of thyroid dysfunction was low, suggesting that only a minor proportion of the VTE events in the population can be attributed to thyroid dysfunction. Vitamin D status was not associated with VTE risk. Finally, calcium and PTH alone were not associated with future risk of VTE. However, high levels of both calcium and PTH were associated with increased risk of VTE compared to subjects with normal calcium and PTH...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Based on {{comparisons}} of short-term cohort studies or cross-sectional samples of patients from different calendar times, {{it has been}} suggested that present patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a milder disease course compared with that of patients in past decades. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability in patients with RA has become milder over the past several years. METHODS: We used the Nijmegen inception cohort of early RA, which included all patients with newly diagnosed RA who had attended the department of rheumatology at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre since 1985. Patients were assessed for disease activity by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS 28) every 3 months and for functional disability by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) every 6 months. Within the total cohort, 4 subcohorts were defined, based on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> of the patients (1985 - 1990, 1990 - 1995, 1995 - 2000, 2000 - 2005). To investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability (over time) was different between the subcohorts, longitudinal regression analysis (linear mixed models) was used, with the DAS 28 and HAQ DI over time as outcome variables, respectively, and subcohort as the independent variable, correcting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The treatment strategy was compared between the subcohorts. RESULTS: The DAS 28 at baseline and over the first 5 years of disease was lower in the more recent subcohorts. The HAQ DI did not show improvement but instead a trend toward worsening functional disability. Using longitudinal regression it was shown that disease activity improved early in the disease course and stabilized thereafter, and that this improvement was greater in patients in the more recent subcohorts and in patients with a higher baseline DAS 28. Initially, the HAQ DI also improved but stabilized thereafter, and this initial improvement was less pronounced in patients in the more recent subcohorts and was greater for patients with a higher baseline HAQ DI. The treatment strategy was more aggressive in the more recent subcohorts, as shown by a shorter duration from diagnosis to the start of treatment with prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and a greater prevalence of DMARD therapy. CONCLUSION: The course of disease activity in RA patients has become milder in more recent years.

Objectives: The purpose of this thesis was to examine by gender the smoking status prevalence, its associations and changes in distribution according to selected Socio- economic and lifestyle characteristics, in a Norwegian population of 634, 819 men and women, using a four group time period based on calendar years from 1974 to 2003. Methods: This cross sectional study analyzed data from 634, 819 Norwegian men and women that participated in the 40 years study, the three counties study and the Cohort of Norway Study, from 1974 to 2003. A univariate descriptive analysis was done to examine the male and female studied population by smoking status with education, income, BMI, marital status and physical activity as variables of interest. The effect of each variable was examined controlling on the other variables and age at inclusion. A multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95 % (CIs) was performed to determine current and former smoker’s odds, by levels of education, income, BMI, physical activity and marital status. All models were stratified by gender, smoking status and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> in four calendar periods [(1974 - 1980) (1981 - 1987) (1988 - 1995) (1996 - 2003) ]. Conclusions: From the initial studied period (1974 - 1980) to the final (1996 - 2003), the prevalence of male and female current smokers decreased significantly. From the initial studied period (1974 - 1980) to the final (1996 - 2003) there was an increase in the proportion of males and females current smokers in the following categories: -	Higher level of education. 				- Higher income levels -	Divorced/ widowed category. 			- BMI levels (+ 30 kg/m 2). -	Higher levels of Physical activity	 In both, first (1974 - 1980) and last studied period (1996 - 2003) smoking was associated with SES and marital status. Lower levels of education and being divorced/widowed increased the likelihood of smoking for males and females in this study. In the same periods, lifestyle choices were also associated with smoking. Males and females in the upper levels of BMI and physical activity were less likely to smoke. As for income levels and single marital status, these predictors showed contrasting associations with male and female current smokers in the first and last studied period...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves 103 - 107. vii, 107 l illusAn {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the inert gas content <b>of</b> Some mineral <b>inclusions</b> from volcanic rocks. Potassium-argon <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> these <b>inclusions</b> has shown that they contain radiogenic argon in excess of that predicted by geochronological methods. Inclusions from Hualalai (Hawaii), Salt Lake Crater (Oahu), dredged from the Puna Rift east of Kilauea (Hawaii), and from Bultfontein, Republic of South Africa were examined. Specimens investigated were dunite nodules and separated grains of olivine, mica, pyroxene, and feldspar. Existing gas extraction and mass spectrographic equipment was modified to allow helium analysis, and also to make the entire gas analysis more rapid and convenient. A technique was developed for the analysis of potassium in olivine by flame photometry. The results from this study indicate that a similarity exists in helium-to-argon ratios found in inclusions from different sources and that the absolute inert gas content varies significantly within individual samples. The excess argon found in the deep ocean tholeiite cautions against the use of similar samples for potassium-argon dating. This study reaffirms the theory that the excess radiogenic argon found in some minerals is held in fluid inclusions and that these minerals do not yield consistent or significant ages...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{analysis}} {{plays an}} important role in the development of drugs, their manufacture and therapeutic use. Pharmaceutical industries rely upon quantitative chemical analysis to ensure that the raw material used and final products obtained meet the required specifications. The number of drugs and drug formulations introduced into the market has been increasing at an alarming rate. These drugs or formulations may be either new entities or partial structural modifications of the existing ones or novel dosage forms (controlled / sustained release formulations) or multi component dosage forms. Very often, there is a time lag from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> introduction of a drug into the market to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> its <b>inclusion</b> in pharmacopoeias. This happens because of the possible uncertainties in the continuous and wider usage of these drugs, reports of new toxicities (resulting in their withdrawal from the market), development of patient resistance and introduction of better drugs by competitors. Under these conditions, standards and analytical procedures for these drugs may not available in pharmacopoeias. It becomes necessary, therefore, to develop newer analytical methods for such drugs. Considering all these views some drug formulations from Anti hypertensives were selected for the present study. An extensive literature survey was carried out and it is evident that methods like High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) have been reported for the estimation of these drugs in their biological fluids 15 - 17. There are however, no reports for their estimation by HPLC in their formulations. I...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy {{of three different}} methods for identifying individuals {{at high risk of}} falling. The St- Thomas Risk Assessment tool (STRATIFY- modified for nursing homes), staff judgment of fall risk, and previous falls remembered by the staff were evaluated. We also examined whether a combination of two of the methods would increase accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was carried out for 18 months. One thousand one hundred and forty-eight participants were included and assessed for fall risk. Falls among these residents were recorded from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> to the date of death, transfer, or end of observation time. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios, as well as Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional hazard model, with time to the first fall as the dependent variable. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and likelihood ratios were calculated for falls within 30, 90 and 180 days of assessment for fall risk. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy (49. 6 %) of the 1148 residents had one or more falls during the observation period. One thousand one hundred had more than 30 days of observation, 987 more than 90 days, and 867 more than 180 days. For falls within 30 days of assessment for fall risk, sensitivity varied from 65 % to 72 %, specificity from 69 % to 75 %, positive predictive value from 31 % to 35 % and negative predictive value from 91 % to 92 %. Sensitivity and negative predictive value decreased for falls within 90 days and decreased further for falls within 180 days, whereas specificity and positive predictive value increased for all three assessment methods. Staff judgment of fall risk was the single method having the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity. A combination of either two of them increased sensitivity to more than 80 %, but decreased specificity. The positive Likelihood ratio varied from 2. 24 to 2. 70 and the negative Likelihood ratio from 0. 41 to 0. 49 for falls within 30 days. The relative risk of sustaining a fall was 2. 4, 2. 9 and 3. 0 times higher for those assessed to be at high risk of falls compared with those assessed to be at low risk, according to STRATIFY, staff judgment of fall risk and previous falls remembered by the staff, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of the three methods did not differ markedly. However, staff judgment had the highest sensitivity and the lowest specificity after 30, 90 and 180 days. A combination of either two of the methods showed the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity...|$|E

Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol., 2014 Jan; 34 (1) : 226 - 30. Available at [URL] Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially fatal disease, often occuring {{in the absence of}} obvious predisposing factors. Recent observational studies in selected populations have suggested a closer association between arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke) and VTE, two disease entities considered separate in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology and treatments. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relation between atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic risk factors and risk of incident VTE in a general population. 	We recruited study participants from the fourth survey of the Tromsø study, conducted in 1994 - 95. In this study, more than 27, 000 men and women, aged 25 - 97 years, participated, and a subset of participants (n= 9056) were also invited to a more extensive second visit. Incident VTE events were registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> until the end of follow up, and in papers 1 and 4, incident MI events were also registered. Furthermore, we performed a case-control study in which 20 participants with a previous history of unprovoked VTE and 20 healthy controls were subjected to a fat-tolerance test in order to examine the potential impact of postprandial lipemia on VTE risk. 	In a cause-specific hazards model, increasing age and obesity were shared risk factors for both MI and VTE. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, current smoking, higher levels of blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol) were associated with increased risk of MI, but not with VTE. Carotid atherosclerosis, measured by intima-media thickness and total plaque area, did also increase MI risk, while showing no association with VTE. Increasing levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) did not increase VTE risk. Subjects with a history of unprovoked VTE had similar lipoprotein subclasses size, distribution, and postprandial lipemia as healthy controls. 	Based on our findings, atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors {{do not appear to be}} associated with VTE risk. The observed association between arterial and venous thrombosis may be explained by other common risk factors or restricted to the events themselves...|$|E

Available at [URL] Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common disease, with serious short- and long-term complications and a potential fatal outcome. Despite the knowledge of several inherited and acquired risk factors for VTE, still 30 - 50 % of the VTE events occur in the absence of obvious predisposing factors. Traditionally, arterial and venous thrombosis has been considered as separate disease entities with different pathology, epidemiology and treatments. However, recently this concept has been challenged, and a potential link between arterial cardiovascular disease and VTE has been suggested. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on the risk of VTE in a prospective population-based study. Subjects were recruited from the fourth survey of the Tromsø study, conducted in 1994 - 95. A total of 27 158 men and women, aged 25 - 97 years, participated. Incident VTE events were registered from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> through the end of follow-up, September 1, 2007. In summary, age, male gender, obesity, mean platelet volume and family history of myocardial infarction were identified as risk factors for venous thrombosis, which makes these factors, shared risk factors for both arterial and venous thrombosis. Other traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as serum lipid levels, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes were not associated with risk of VTE. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome had higher risk of VTE, but this relationship was essentially dependent on the presence of abdominal obesity. Taken together, these findings imply that traditional atherosclerotic risk factors are not shared by arterial and venous thrombosis, and suggest that common determinants for arterial and venous thrombosis are probably related to mechanisms of thrombus formation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an electron microprobe study <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> within igneous zircons from ca. 3800 Ma metatonalite sample G 97 / 18. Crystalline inclusions are K-feldspar. plagioclase, quartz, hornblende, biotite, ilmenite and apatite. Additionally, one globular polymineralic inclusion interpreted as crystallised melt {{occurs at the}} surface of a polished grain mount. This consists of plagioclase + quartz + K-feldspar around a biotite lath. Other similar, but rare globular inclusions were seen buried within other zircons below the polished surface. These inclusions, particularly the presence of K-feldspar and plagioclase in broadly equal amounts, entail crystallisation of the zircons from a (residual) granitic (sensu-stricto) melt rather than a tonalitic melt. SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe) U/Pb <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> zircons with <b>inclusions</b> indicates that they grew at ca. 3800 Ma (the accepted igneous age of the rock). This inclusion suite is compatible with the low Ti-in-zircon temperatures for G 97 / 18 igneous zircon (Hiess et al., 2008). Therefore, low Ti-in-zircon temperatures and 2 ̆ 2 granitic 2 ̆ 2 inclusions found in Hadean detrital zircons do not necessitate crystallisation from low temperature granites, because such features would also be found if Hadean zircons had crystallised (late) from higher temperature zircon-undersaturated melts of tonalitic composition.
