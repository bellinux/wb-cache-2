500|$|In {{response}} to Chávez's endorsement, Chomsky told The New York Times {{that he would}} be [...] "happy to meet" [...] the Venezuelan President, asserting that he was [...] "quite interested" [...] in what his administration had achieved and thought many of Chávez's views to be [...] "quite constructive". This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual's work, remarking [...] "Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival", before comparing Chomsky's thesis with the concept of [...] "Socialism or Barbarism" [...] advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking through an interpreter, Chomsky replied that [...] "I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy. What's harder is to create a better world... and what's so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see how a better world is being created." [...] He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government's role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d'état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez's administration, remarking his opinion that their moves [...] "toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out".|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 1966, Don Demeter and Julio Navarro were traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Joe Christopher and pitcher Earl Wilson. The Red Sox {{had been}} {{attempting}} anywhere from several weeks to {{several months to}} obtain Demeter, offering a combination of catcher Bob Tillman and an infielder, but the Tigers continually rejected the offers. General manager Billy Herman had known Demeter {{ever since he was}} a coach for the Dodgers several years prior. Demeter was a player Herman wanted to acquire ever since he took the manager post in September 1964. [...] "He (Demeter) is a good hitter with power. I know he will take good advantage of our left field wall." [...] He went on to say, [...] "One of the things I like best about Demeter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use him at five positions. He can play anywhere in the outfield, and he can play both first and third base. Don will shake up a few people on this club." [...] Herman cited that his then current plan was to put Demeter in center field, but was also considering playing him at third base, where Joe Foy had been struggling offensively. Herman also said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.|$|E
60|$|My {{conclusion}} <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{have nothing}} to do with the matter, either to sustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it, or to revoke or modify it as you demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Colfax," [...] said Stephen, coming forward, [...] "you're {{too sick}} {{a man to}} talk. I'll look up the General. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> have you sent North to-day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I want to {{take back}} one thing. That Detective is a good fellow. What you have told me of him puts him in a new light. The best proof of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go quietly to sleep tonight, and leave the lamps in his care!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I follow you, Miss Thurwell," [...] he said, shaking his head. [...] "All I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prove this Mr. Bernard Brown, or Bernard Maddison, or {{whatever}} else he chooses to call himself, guilty of that murder. That's what we want, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is better}} so," [...] Ronald said, as he {{finished}} the letter. [...] "It would only have made it harder for me if I had seen her again. For {{if there is one}} thing more certain than another, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never ask any woman to be my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} all deeply," [...] said the Knight earnestly, [...] "but think it not ill of me if I cannot take it. Gladly have I {{borrowed}} it from you, {{but it may not}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take it as a gift." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the ride}} back to camp Jones {{expressed}} himself thus: [...] "How happy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep this lion and the others {{we are going to}} capture, for my own. When I was in the Yellowstone Park I did not get to keep one of the many I captured. The military officials took them from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest saint," [...] says he--"purest soul, {{that has}} {{had so much to}} suffer, that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a {{treasure}} of love. 'Tis for me to kneel, not for you: 'tis for me to <b>be</b> thankful <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make you happy. Hath my life any other aim? Blessed <b>be</b> God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> serve you! What pleasure, think you, could all the world give me compared to that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is not finished,' he said, 'and what I {{have written}} does not {{altogether}} satisfy me; {{but you can}} judge from what you have heard {{how it is that}} I think of that lady, and how impossible it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> in any way banish her from my mind, or willingly from my vision.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My only regret <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of {{so little}} use to you." [...] The {{words and the}} tone touched a new spring in her, and she went on with more sense of freedom, yet still not saying {{anything}} she had designed to say, and beginning to hurry, that she might somehow arrive at the right words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask it of herself, O Watcher, for I cannot tell you. All I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> trace my {{own family}} for ten generations and that my tenth forefather told his son on his deathbed, for the saying has come down through his descendants--that {{when he was young}} She-who-commands had ruled the land for more scores of years than he could count months of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It did, ma'am," [...] Sergeant Wilks said gravely. [...] "I {{liked the}} look of the boy much. He was brave and modest, and a gentleman. I spoke about him to the {{fishermen}} that night, and everyone had a good word for him; so I said to myself, 'I can't reward him for what he has done directly, but it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> indirectly.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Trees were {{destroyed}} during the reunion of Fëanor and Fingolfin. The Valar, realising {{that now the}} light of the Trees survived only in the Silmarils, asked Fëanor to give them up so that they could restore the Trees. Fëanor said: [...] "It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> unlock my jewels, but never again shall I make their like; and if I must break them, I shall break my heart." ...|$|R

6000|$|And now is this news, Cogia, {{or is it}} not? It {{all depends}} upon the point of view, and I call it news.

60|$|I was {{thinking}} over some {{on my way}} up here. They were the illustrations I spoke about to the young lady on the way up. And I've come to the conclusion, curious though it <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use {{every one of these}} freaks of memory to teach you all a lesson. I'm convinced that each one has its moral. And I think it's my duty to hand the moral on to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, lady, I shall not, {{for money}} would be of little service {{to me in a}} city that is about to be taken by storm. Also I hate Ithobal, who {{threatened}} my life--as you did also, by the way--and will do my best to keep you from his clutches. Now for my second point: it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see little use in all this because Ithobal, being defrauded of you, will attack, and then----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are the {{daughter}} of your mother, dear Isobel," [...] he said. [...] "Beyond <b>that,</b> what <b>is</b> there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say--I, who loved her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> desire," [...] he {{answered}} gravely; {{and sat down}} in answer to her invitation, the precious casket on his knees.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Clavering would, no doubt, {{have made}} the offer to you himself had it not <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> perhaps, speak to you about dear Fanny better than he could. Though our {{prudence}} has not been quite to your mind, you can, at any rate, understand that we might very much object to her marrying you when {{there was nothing for}} you to live on, even though we had no objection to yourself personally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘There is here no {{question}} of who I am,’ I replied. ‘I may be the devil or the Archbishop of Canterbury for what you know, or need know. The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you—it appears that nobody else can; and I {{will tell you how}} I propose to do it. I will give the lady a seat in my chaise, if you will return the compliment by allowing my servant to ride one of your horses.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lizzun t' me,' he said again. 'I {{seen you}} rehearse, as I promised Miss Denison I would. You ain't bad for an amateur. You gotta lot to learn, but it's in you. What {{it comes to}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fix you up in the four-a-day, if you'll take thirty-five per. I can't do better than that, and I wouldn't have done that if the little lady hadn't of kep' after me. Take it or leave it. What do you say?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is here no {{question}} of who I am," [...] I replied. [...] "I may be the devil or the Archbishop of Canterbury for what you know, or need know.

6000|$|... "It {{shall not}} be the last of it. I will try again. What <b>is</b> there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may make myself worthy of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go to bed, and sleep, {{and get up}} and eat my meals {{without missing}} {{the sound of the}} {{trumpets}} so much as I did at first. I remember hearing of people who lived in a mill, and couldn't sleep when the mill stopped. It was like that with me when our mill stopped at first. I had got myself so used to the excitement of it, that I could hardly live without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll tackle to? Very well; so be it. Now, Mr. Crawley, let me {{hear what}} it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you." [...] Of a sudden, as Mr. Toogood spoke these last words, the whole {{tone of his voice}} seemed to change, and even the {{position}} of his body became so much altered as to indicate a different kind of man. [...] "You just tell your story in your own way, and I won't interrupt you till you've done. That's always the best." ...|$|E
60|$|As for editing Beaumont and Fletcher, {{the task}} {{would be one}} immensi laboris. The {{confusion}} is now so great, the errors so enormous, that the editor must use a boldness quite unallowable in any other case. All I can say as to Beaumont and Fletcher <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> point out well enough where something has been lost, and that something so and so was probably in the original; but the law of Shakspeare's thought and verse is such, that I feel convinced that not only could I detect the spurious, but supply the genuine, word.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> sorry indeed <b>that</b> such trouble {{should have}} been caused to you," [...] Gervaise replied; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give you no assistance." ...|$|R
