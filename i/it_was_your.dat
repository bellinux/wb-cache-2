He gave an abridged {{version of his}} speech on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October 2007. The talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical [...] "final talk", with a topic such as [...] "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if you knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> last chance?"

2500|$|In Finland {{a similar}} {{campaign}} was announced on 16 March 2009 {{to run on}} buses in Finland {{in three of the}} country's largest cities, Helsinki, Tampere and Turku. The campaign was run bun Vapaa-ajattelijain liitto. In Helsinki, the text said [...] "Jumalaa tuskin on olemassa.

In Tampere and Turku the text was changed to [...] "Iloitse elämästäsi kuin se olisi ainoasi, koska se on" [...] ("Enjoy your life as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> only one, because it is") due to opposition of local transportation providers.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{opens in}} a Mad Max-esque desert setting, where a posse of {{well-muscled}} girls stands before {{a group of}} somewhat nonplussed boys. At first, they look like they're going to perform for the boys, like the Spice Girls in [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] or maybe taunt them a bit, like Janet Jackson and her crew in [...] "You Want This". But there's another story here, {{having to do with}} the juxtapositions of the post-apocalyptic environment, the athletic survivor-girls wielding their martial-arts sticks, and the song's lyrics. The lyrics concern Mýa's query to her man, wondering why another girl is calling his phone [...] "after midnight". This caller, narrates Mýa, is [...] "Saying come over / Cause she's all alone / I could tell <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> ex / By your tone." ...|$|E

We'll just say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it was just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
