40|$|For {{the last}} fifty years or so, the members of the field of {{political}} science have studied the phenomenon known as the Cold War. It has fascinated many scholars and almost demands attention.

Loyalties were built around it. The world divided around it. Most people could not have imagined the end of the Cold War ten years ago. Even now it is difficult to truly grasp the reality of the situation. That is the impetus for this study. It is an attempt to define the realities of a post-Cold War world. More specifically, it is an attempt to define the foreign policy realities for America in the post-Cold War era...|$|R
