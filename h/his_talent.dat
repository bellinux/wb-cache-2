5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite <b>his</b> <b>talent,</b> he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of <b>his</b> <b>talent.</b> He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children. When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as <b>his</b> <b>talent</b> agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three Saturday Night Live cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday Night Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday Night Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season.

After pitching at Broward College for a season, the San Diego Padres signed him for a $1.25 million bonus. He debuted for the Padres in 2009, and established himself in their starting rotation. The Reds traded four players, including three prospects, to acquire Latos before the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. <b>His</b> <b>talent</b> brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E
