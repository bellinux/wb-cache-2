We are breeding a million degenerate citizens by starving them, to say nothing of the effect of disease and bad air, of the constant fear of poverty that haunts the great majority of homes.

50|$|When Lotze {{published}} these works, {{medical science}} {{was still under}} the influence of Schelling's philosophy of nature. The mechanical laws, to which external things were subject, were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world. Mechanism was the unalterable connexion of every phenomenon a with other phenomena b, c, d, either as following or preceding it; mechanism was the inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast, and by which they are connected. The object of those writings was to establish the all-pervading rule of mechanism. But the mechanical view of nature is not identical with the materialistic. In the last of the above-mentioned works the question is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind, and the relation between mind and body; the answer <b>is</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider mind as an immaterial principle, its action, however, on the body and vice versa as purely mechanical, indicated by the fixed laws of a psycho-physical mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of the signing of the protocol, Garcia characterized general prison facilities as [...] "living hells", because those who are in penology and rehabilitation [...] "are missing out the essence of compassion, redemption and restoration in jail management". He added: [...] "They are too busy looking for creative ways to punish an offender instead of restoring him to become the human being that he <b>is.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look at prisons beyond the cycle of crime and punishment and certainly look inside underlying social, cultural and scriptural implications of rehabilitation. As it is, those creative ways of punishing offenders that have led to restrictive and punitive conditions in jails have also bred demons out of prisoners". Garcia said that this therapeutic protocol of dance and music is meant to restore dignity to people who suffer the stigma of incarceration and restore self-esteem to inmates because they are alienated from society. Therapeutic music and dance is meant to help prisoners cope with their depression and anxiety, improve their well-being as they go through a transition phase and reintegrate to society. Music is a protocol to heal them of emotional and psychological disorders and trauma {{as a result of the}} offense or incarceration". He concluded that [...] "the experience of the CPDRC Dancing Inmates has proven a clinical breakthrough of using therapeutic music and dance in healing, restoring and rehabilitating inmates to become dignified human beings. This is actually what prompted BMJP to take interest in spreading such a program", he said.|$|E

Both sides sustained casualties, and the next morning al-Qaeda fighters began abandoning their positions and retreating from the area. [...] As requested by the theater commander, additional army infantry, combat engineering and Mountain troops were rushed to help the remaining fighting troops. The battle ended soon after as reinforcements arrived and took their positions. With the arrival of the additional mountain troops, the army intensified its search for remaining al-Qaeda fighters. A week later, the Pakistan Army captured the entire mountainous area along with hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, in {{addition}} to starting a home decorating business with his wife, Routley {{became president of the}} IWA-Canada, Local 1-80, conflicted with environmentalists protesting logging at Clayoquot Sound, where he viewed the postponement of logging as costing jobs, and he opposed the division of Tree Farm License 46 as detrimental to the Youbou mill which was struggling. In the summer 2000, Routley represented over 12,000 members of the IWA-Canada, Local 1-80 engaged in a 10-day strike against the Forest Industrial Relations (FIR), a corporate bargaining unit representing 70 companies. After that three-year contract expired, another strike occurred (with {{the exception of a few}} financially troubled mills) over the attempt by the FIR (which by then represented 61 companies) to impose a contract onto the union. The three-week strike ended with back-to-work legislation, the Coastal Forest Industry Dispute Settlement Act, adopted by the 37th Parliament of British Columbia. The back-to-work legislation caused a rift within the union, as it was agreed to by IWA-Canada president Dave Haggard, but opposed by the local presidents, including Routley. He also opposed union leadership during its merger into the United Steelworkers Union of America — Routley opposed the merger believing it would make the union less responsive to forestry issues. Union members approved the merger and Routley kept his position as a local president, saying [...] "my view <b>is</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> embrace this change". Also during the 2000s, Routley fought against increases to raw log exports which he saw as coming at the expense of Vancouver Island mills as the raw logs were being sent to more efficient mills in the United States and Asia and he directly blamed the softwood lumber deal and legislated increased allowable raw log export quotas. With TimberWest seeking to permanently close the Youbou mill, Routley and community members sought to purchase the mill as the Cowichan Lake Community Forest Co-op. The cooperative was unable to raise sufficient funds and the mill closed in 2001. The union sued the province for damages resulting from the closure arguing it violated a clause in the Tree Farm License and the province in turn sued Youbou owners TimberWest for the damages.|$|E
