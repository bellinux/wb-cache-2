40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} presents {{performance of}} nitrogen gas as a coolant in machining titanium. Compressed nitrogen gas {{stored in a}} cylindrical tank is supplied to the cutting zone via the stainless steel tube of 2 x 8 x 25 mm (inside diameter x outside diameter x length) connected to the flexible hose and specially-designed valve with pressure controller. Machining experiments are carried out on conventional turning center. The cutting tool used is triangular insert of ISO-TPGN 160308 with the holder (ISO-CTGPR 3232 K). The cutting <b>insert</b> <b>grade</b> is KC 5010 (TiAlN 3 coated carbide) as recommended by Kennametal for machining titanium. During machining, the tube is manually directed to be just-above the tool rake face and the nitrogen gas is supplied with high pressure so that the cutting zone receives an effective cooling {{as well as the}} chip brakes easily. The effectiveness of this new cooling strategy is demonstrated by the cutting edge condition and surface finish after machining at various speeds, and also by comparing with performance of conventional coolant. The result is found to be excellent in terms of relative amount of tool wear and surface finish. The cutting insert has surprisingly remained almost intact when using nitrogen gas coolant whereas severe tool wear occurred with conventional coolant even at low cutting speed. This cryogenic strategy also improved machined surface quality greatly...|$|E
40|$|In machining, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to select appropriate tools (tool holder and insert), machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) and tool replacement times for all tools due to the wide variety of tooling options and the complexity of the machining operations. Of particular interest is the complex interrelationships between tool selection, cutting data calculation and tool life prediction and control. Numerous techniques and methods of measuring and modelling tool wear, particularly in turning operations were reviewed. The characteristics of these methods were analysed and it was found that most tool wear studies were self-contained without any obvious interface with tool selection. The work presented herein deals with the development of an integrated, off-line tool life control system (TLC). The tool life control system (TLC) predicts tool life for the various turning operations and for a wide variety of workpiece materials. TLC is a closed-loop system combining algorithms with feedback based on direct measurement of flank wear. TLC has been developed using Crystal, which is a rule-based shell and statistical techniques such as multiple regression and the least-squares method. TLC consists of five modules namely, the technical planning of the cutting operation (TPO), tool life prediction (TLP), tool life assessor (TLA), tool life management (TLM) and the tool wear balancing and requirement planning (TRP). The technical planning of the cutting operation (TPO) module contains a procedure to select tools and generate efficient machining parameters (cutting velocity, feed rate and depth of cut) for turning and boring operations. For any selected <b>insert</b> <b>grade,</b> material sub-class, type of cut (finishing, medium-roughing and roughing) and type of cutting fluid, the tool life prediction (TLP) module calculates the theoretical tool life value (T(_sugg)) based on tool life coefficients derived from tool manufacturers' data. For the selected operation, the tool life assessor (TLA) generates a dynamic multiple regression to calculate the approved tool life constants (InC, 1 /a, 1 /β) based on the real tool life data collected from experiments. These approved constants are used to calculate a modified tool life value (T(_mod)) for the given operation. The stochastic nature of tool life is taken into account, as well as the uncertainty of the available information by introducing a 95 % confidence level for tool life. The tool life management module (TLM) studies the variations in tool life data predicted by TLP and TLA and the approved tool life data collected from the shop floor and provides feedback concerning the accuracy of tool life predictions. Finally, the tool life balancing and requirement planning (TRP) methods address the problem of controlling and balancing the wear rate of the cutting edge by the appropriate alteration of cutting conditions so that each one will machine the number of parts that optimize the overall tool changing strategy. Two new tool changing strategies were developed based on minimum production cost, with very encouraging results. Cutting experiments proved that the state of wear and the tool life can be predicted efficiently by the proposed model. The resulting software can be used by machine manufacturers, tool consultants or process planners to achieve the integrated planning and control of tool life as part of the tool selection and cutting data calculation activity...|$|E

40|$|In the industry, High Speed Machining (HSM) is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} the key manufacturing {{technologies for}} higher productivity and lower production costs. Existing cutting tools are coated to improve the tool life and the performance. These coatings are all based on the principle that the coating is much harder than the work piece material. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the new coatings for cutting tools based on a new approach: Low friction self-lubricant MoS 2 /Ti composite coatings (MoST) deposited by PVD magnetron sputtering technique. Dry machining (DM) is an important objective in machining industry to reduce environmental- and production costs. DM using MoST is possible in some cases: because of the low friction, the use of coolant is not necessary. Also, better chip evacuation and a smoother cutting process will occur, which can lead to higher accuracy of products.

The main results obtained with these new ‘'hybrid’’ inserts are: (1) Tools with MoST can be used in dry milling operations at normal cutting speeds; (2) MoST coatings reach good tool life (1. 5 – 2 times longer than ‘State of the art’ tools) at normal cutting speeds...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSilicone {{implants}} {{are frequently}} used in augmentation rhinoplasty in Asians. A common complication of silicone augmentation rhinoplasty is capsular contracture. This {{is similar to}} the capsular contracture after augmentation mammoplasty, but a classification for secondary contracture after augmentation rhinoplasty with silicone implants has not yet been established, and treatment algorithms by grade or severity have yet to be developed. MethodsPhotographs of 695 patients who underwent augmentation rhinoplasty with a silicone implant from May 2001 to May 2015 were analyzed. The mean observation period was 11. 4 months. Of the patients, 81 were male and 614 were female, {{with a mean age of}} 35. 9 years. Grades were assigned according to postoperative appearance. Grade I was a natural appearance, as if an implant had not been <b>inserted.</b> <b>Grade</b> II was an unnatural lateral margin of the implant. Clearly identifiable implant deviation was classified as grade III, and short nose deformation was grade IV. ResultsGrade I outcomes were found in 498 patients (71. 7 %), grade II outcomes in 101 (14. 5 %), grade III outcomes in 75 (10. 8 %), and grade IV outcomes in 21 patients (3. 0 %). Revision surgery was indicated for the 13. 8 % of all patients who had grade III or IV outcomes.

Object-Oriented Design and Programming Methods are employed {{to construct and}} implement the system. Based on partial and imprecise information, the system is able to select rotating cutter products available in current commercial market, and design cutting conditions for an optimized objective. The system consists of four modules: a database, a rule base, a cutter selection module and a cutting condition design module. The database consists of six kinds of data files: machinability of workpieces, machining plan, fuzzy rule, tool adapter, machine tool, as well as cutter inventory files. The rules in the rule base are developed based on fuzzy set theory. They are used to cross-define unknown information and to determine {{the relationships between the}} inputs and outputs information. The cutter selection module is developed based on fuzzy logic, in which the cutter selection is conducted in three steps. First, the input information is 2 ̆ 2 fuzzied 2 ̆ 2. Next, using the fuzzy correlation functions, <b>insert</b> <b>grades</b> and cutters are selected. Then, the selected grades and cutters are searched against the cutter inventory data file to check the availability.

40|$|Aluminum Boron Carbide Metal Matrix Composites (Al-MMC) have {{revolutionized}} aeronautical and automobile industries, in {{the recent}} times due to their exceptional mechanical and physical properties. However it is seen that the machinability of these composites is greatly reduced by the hardness of constituent reinforcement particles. Moreover these constituent reinforcement particles serve as disadvantage by increasing tool wear accompanying undesirable depression in life of tool. This paper presents the experimental investigations on turning of Al 6061 matrix metal reinforced with 10 % by weight of boron carbide (B 4 Cp) particles - which was fabricated using Stir casting method.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{aeroengine}} superalloys have gained high {{amount of research}} interest owing to their wide engineering application particularly in strategic environment. 17 - 4 PH (precipitation hardened) stainless steel (SS) is one such grade of aerospace alloys used to manufacture mostly small parts and mainly stator of aircraft engine in place of Titanium alloy for material cost saving. 17 - 4 PH SS falls {{under the category of}} difficult-to-cut material because of its low thermal conductivity and high ductility. Although most of the research work was concentrated on machinability of Nickel-based and Titanium based superalloy, no such work on the 17 - 4 PH has been reported so far. Today different coated tools are widely used in machining industries. Therefore it is also essential to select suitable coating material for machining such aeroengine alloys. In order to achieve some of the objectives, the research work has been under taken aiming at investigating the influence of cutting speed (100, 140 & 190 m/min) and feed rate (0. 16, 0. 20 & 0. 24) on various machining characteristics like chip morphology, chip reduction coefficient, tool wear, cutting force, cutting temperature and machined surface roughness.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{recently}} developed 70 -degrees bevel cutter with tangentially arranged positively raked carbide <b>inserts</b> (P 40 <b>grade)</b> {{has led to the}} use of higher cutting conditions than those employed when milling the nickel-based nimonic 75 alloy with a 45 -degrees approach-angle cutter having negatively raked carbide inserts.

The K 20 grade of cemented-carbide tools out-performed the K 40 grade when milling with a 45 -degrees approach-angle cutter due to their improved properties. Chipping and/or fracture of the tool edges were the dominant failure modes under most of the conditions tested, these being caused by a combination of high temperature and high thermal and mechanical stress, as well as adhesion of the work material on the tool rake-face during milling. Tool fracture can be caused also by attritional wear and thermal cracking mainly at the high temperatures usually generated under high cutting conditions.

30|$|The {{experimental}} work {{was carried out}} on a CNC lathe (5.5  kW spindle power and 3500  rpm maximum rotational speed). Due {{to the importance of}} the dry machining in the modern industry, the tests were performed under the dry condition without any fluid, gas, and/or solid coolant. Standard CBN inserts (ISO code CNGA 120404 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120408 S 010 - 30 A, CNGA 120412 S 010 - 30 A) made by Sandvik™ Coromant were used as the cutting tools with the following geometry: clearance angle = 0 °, chamfer angle = 30 °, chamfer width = 0.10  mm, edge thickness = 4.76  mm, edge length = 12  mm, and rhombic tip angle = 80 °. The same inserts with different nose radius of 0.4  mm, 0.8  mm, and 1.2  mm were used for analysis of the nose radius effect. In order to have a stable cutting condition, each experiment was performed with a new sharp <b>insert.</b> The <b>inserts</b> <b>grade</b> was CB 7025, which is completely suitable for hard turning operation. The tool holder used in the experiments was standard DCBNR/L- 2525 [*]M. According to the cutting tool manufacturer’s recommendation, the inserts were clamped on the holder with the tightening torque of 3.9  Nm. Round bars of MDN 250 steel with 35  mm diameter and 85  mm length were used for the experiments. In order to increase the hardness of the steel, according to the ASM International standard, the round bars have been heated at about 850  °C for 75  min, and then quickly quenched in the water (Dossett and Boyer 2006). Subsequent aging was performed for approximately 3  h at a temperature of 500  °C to produce a fine dispersion of Ni 3 (X,Y) intermetallic phases along the dislocations left by martensitic transformation, where X and Y are solute elements added for such precipitation. A pre-cut with 0.5  mm cutting depth was performed before hardening the steel to remove the rusts and oxide layers {{from the surface of the}} workpiece. Finally, the hardness level of 55 HRC was obtained by performing the heat treatment method for the round bars of MDN 250 steel. Average surface roughness (Ra) values were recorded with a Surftest 301 Mitutoyo® roughness meter set to a cut-off of 0.8  mm. The surface roughness values were measured at five equally spaced locations along the cutting length. The average of this five roughness values was taken as the arithmetic surface roughness value (Ra). This measuring process was repeated three times for each test and their average was considered as the final surface roughness. A piezoelectric type vibration meter was used to measure and recorded the acceleration of the radial holder vibration. Three forces component, i.e., feed force, cutting force, and radial force, was measured precisely by using a Kistler piezoelectric turning dynamometer and a signal amplifier connected to a control unit, data acquisition board and microcomputer. The maximum flank wear (VBmax) was measured using a TM 505 Mitutoyo® toolmaker’s microscope with 1  μm resolution. The dimensional accuracy, which is defined as the difference between the desired cutting depth and the obtained depth of cut, was determined by measuring the final dimensional deviation. The diameter deviation was measured using a precision dial gauge with an accuracy of ±[*] 0.01  mm. Diameter deviation was measured at five equally spaced points along the cutting length and the average of these five values considered as the final dimensional deviation value. In this paper, insert nose radius, feed rate, cutting depth, and speed were considered as the processing parameters. The values of the variables were chosen according to the recommendation of the cutting tool catalogs. In order to conduct a comprehensive study, the cutting depth and feed speed with a wider range were selected compared with the ranges chosen by the previous researchers in the hard turning operation. Furthermore, to increase the confidence level of the results, all the measurements were repeated three times for each test.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} of projectile penetration of extruded 6061 T 6 aluminum alloy sandwich panels with empty and alumina filled, triangular corrugated cores have been experimentally investigated using zero obliquity, 12. 7  mm diameter hard steel projectiles whose diameter {{was about a}} half that of the core's unit cell width. We find that low momentum impacts are laterally deflected by interactions with the inclined webs of the empty core. Complete penetration occurred by shear-off within the impacted front face sheet, followed by stretching, bending and tensile fracture of the core webs and finally shear-off within the back face sheet. This combination of mechanisms was less effective at dissipating the projectiles kinetic energy than the shear-off (plugging) mechanism of penetration of the equivalent solid aluminum panel. <b>Inserting</b> ballistic <b>grade</b> alumina prisms in the triangular cross section spaces of the corrugated core significantly increased the panel's ballistic resistance compared to the empty panel. The presence of the hard ceramic led to severe plastic deformation and fragmentation of the projectile and comminution and macroscopic fracture of the ceramic. The Al/Al 2 O 3 hybrid panel ballistic limit was reached when pairs of parallel cracks formed in the rear face sheet at core web-face sheet nodes. The separation distance between these cracks was dependent upon {{the location of the}} impact with respect to that of the web-face sheet nodes. Nodal impacts resulted in pairs of fractures that were separated by one cell width and a critical velocity below that of the equivalent solid plate. Impacts mid-way between pairs of nodes resulted in back face sheet crack pairs separated by twice the cell width, and a critical velocity higher than the equivalent solid plate. Using X-ray tomography we show this resulted from the formation of oval (not circular) cross section fracture conoids in the ceramics. The conoid angle was about 60 ° in the extrusion direction but only 30 ° in the transverse direction. This observation may have interesting consequences for a panel's resistance to a second, close proximity impact...|$|R

Benchmark tests producing response surface models were developed using conventional low pressure fluid supply and were found to be suitable for the prediction of tool life, surface roughness and cutting force within the range of parameters studied. The PCD inserts significantly outperformed both carbide (by a factor > 24) and PCBN (by a factor > 12) tools in high-speed finish turning, although the performance varied depending on the PCD structure, edge geometry, period of engagement, undeformed chip thickness and jet fluid parameters...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} reinforced with SiC and B 4 C particles are a unique class of advanced engineered materials {{that have been}} developed to use in high strength, high wear resistant and tribological applications. The conventional techniques of producing these composites have some drawbacks. In this study, the aluminium hybrid composite is fabricated using stir casting method. 10 % by weight of SiC particles with an average size of 55 µm along with 7 % by weight of B 4 C particulates were reinforced in to the molten aluminium alloy of designation Al 356. The hardness, chemical composition and the micro-structure of the hybrid composite were investigated. Homogeneous distribution of SiC and B 4 C within Al hybrid composites is clear from the SEM images. Finally an attempt is made to study the machinability characteristics of the hybrid MMC in turning by Poly crystalline Diamond <b>inserts</b> (PCD) of <b>Grade</b> 1600. The experiment was conducted in a medium duty lathe of spindle power 2 kW at various cutting speeds, feeds and depths of cut and parameters such as Power consumed, surface roughness were measured. The surface finish observed was found to be very close to the theoretical surface finish. The deviation in the value is concluded as the other parameters which is influencing the machining. The optimum cutting conditions were obtained from the analysis of the results. By using this optimum cutting condition tool wear study was carried out. It is concluded that, tool wear mechanism is purely abrasive in nature. Surface finish is strongly dependent on cutting speed. KEY WORDS: Hybrid MMC, turning, surface roughness, power consume...|$|R

It is also available at: [URL] demand for productivity and shape complexity on the injection moulding industry necessitates new research to improve tool design, material, and manufacturing. A research field is the development of functionally graded materials (FGMs) to build injection moulds. For example, moulds built with the FGMs technique can have distinctive regions with higher heat conduction. Higher rates of heat transfers from thicker regions of the injected part can be useful to produce better and cheaper injection moulded polymer parts. It is possible to obtain moulds with differential conductivity by adding locally, during the fabrication of the mould, copper to the mould base material such as tool steel. In this work, an investigation into the effect of FGM copper (Cu) -tool steel mould insert over polymer injected parts is presented. The work is divided in two parts: a numerical thermal analysis comparison between Cu-tool steel graded and tool steel inserts and an injection moulding experiment with comparisons between mould surface temperature and degree of crystallinity of polypropylene parts. The numerical model was used to compare different behaviour of the mould heat transfer according to the mould insert material. Thereafter, a bolster was built to hold FGMs and tool steel inserts obtained by a selective laser fusion process. Polypropylene was injected over the inserts to compare with the numeric results. To observe the effect of the cooling rate in the polypropylene parts using the <b>graded</b> <b>inserts,</b> the degree of crystallinity of the parts was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test. The temperature of the mould was also evaluated during the injection cycles. The results showed that the <b>graded</b> Cu-tool steel <b>inserts</b> tested had lower capacity to store heat energy. As Cu was added to the tool steel, the mixture proved to transfer heat more efficiently but it had less capacity to absorb heat...|$|R
30|$|The {{protocol}} {{was approved by}} the hospital’s board. The study was a 2 -year (May 2010 –May 2012) prospective analysis that included 59 consecutive patients (age range 16 – 65  years; mean age 29.3  years; 31 female and 28 male). The inclusion criteria were: (1) history of acute or chronic (more than three episodes of dislocation during a period of more than 2  months) anterior instability of the shoulder, (2) strong clinical suspicion of shoulder instability, (3) MR arthrography of the affected shoulder and (4) subsequent arthroscopy. Exclusion criteria were: (1) previous shoulder surgery, (2) fracture of the greater tuberosity of the humerus with malalignment after reduction and (3) nerve damage related to dislocation or reduction. In all cases initial clinical evaluation of the shoulder was performed by one experienced consultant shoulder surgeon. Those patients with strong clinical suspicion of anteroinferior labrum lesions were referred to the Radiology Department to have an MR arthrogram performed. The average time interval between the clinical and imaging appointment was 3  weeks. All MR arthrograms were performed by one experienced consultant musculoskeletal radiologist (5  years of experience). The images were interpreted for lesion depiction, location and characteristics by the same radiologist. Thereafter, the findings on the MR arthrography report were compared with the arthroscopic ones, as documented in the surgical notes of the patients, with regards to lesion presence and classification. The classification system for fibro-cartilaginous lesions of the glenoid labrum in shoulder instability, published by Faletti et al. [15] was used for the image interpretation and at arthroscopy. According to this system, in terms of grading, grade 0 corresponds to normal findings and grade I represents a tear of the glenoid labrum up to 1  cm in size. In grade II, the lesion involves the middle-inferior portion of the labrum, its size is > 1  cm and is associated with a large capsule. In grade III, the lesion involves a larger portion of the labrum in all its extent, but with its bases still normally <b>inserted.</b> Finally, in <b>grade</b> IV, the anterior fibrocartilaginous glenoid labrum appears entirely discontinuous and anteriorly dislocated. In relation to the imaging criteria classification, demonstration of contrast between the glenoid and the detached labroligamentous complex with associated anterior displacement was characterised as Bankart lesion [12, 13]. An ALPSA lesion was diagnosed when medial displacement of the anteroinferior labroligamentous complex on the glenoid neck was seen [13, 14].|$|R
40|$|Wear of the {{polyethylene}} (PE) {{bearing surface}} and wear particle-induced osteolysis (bone resorption) {{can lead to}} failure of modular total knee replacements and make expensive revision surgery necessary. Gamma-in-air sterilization of the PE insert and having a modular tibial component are both risk factors for excessive backside wear that contribute to osteolysis and implant failure. The overall wear (backside and topside) of modular total knee replacements {{has been subjected to}} considerable research in order to avoid such implant failure. The investigations reported in the present thesis evaluated both the clinical and in vitro wear performance of modular total knee replacements. The clinical investigations included damage assessment of retrieved PE <b>inserts.</b> A semi-quantitative <b>grading</b> method was developed and used to assess backside surface damage on 52 PE inserts retrieved from contemporary total knee replacement surgeries. Statistical analyses, such as univariate and multiple linear regression analysis, were performed to identify factors that influence backside damage including implant design features and patient characteristics. The damage features on the retrieved tibial PE inserts were also assessed with surface characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and surface profilometry. To reduce surface damage and thus wear, PE inserts should be either gas-plasma or ethylene-oxide sterilized, used with polished tibial trays and held in place with a partial-peripheral locking mechanism. Synovial fluid samples were aspirated from a total of twenty patients and some basic biochemical analyses were performed. The total protein concentration, protein constituent fractions, the level of osmolality, and trace element concentrations were measured and compared with the same characteristics of four serum lubricants that were frequently used in simulator wear testing to mimic synovial fluid. In vitro investigations were conducted to explore the effects of some major constituents of the serum lubricants on the wear rate using a knee simulator apparatus. Increased protein constituent degradation led to increased wear. Such findings suggested that a protein layer acted as a boundary lubricant to protect the PE surfaces of knee implants. The protein constituent fractions of alpha calf serum (ACS) were similar to those measured for synovial fluid. These ACS lubricants were used in further wear studies in which hyaluronic acid (HA) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were successively added. The PBS was used in place of the distilled water to generate a serum lubricant with a clinically relevant level of osmolality. The thermal stability of the ACS lubricants and synovial fluid were measured. The thermal stability of the ACS lubricant that contained HA and PBS was about {{the same as that of}} human synovial fluid. The simulator wear rate of PE was significantly influenced by both HA and PBS. In further investigations, sodium azide, which has been used to inhibit microbial growth in simulator wear testing, was shown to be highly ineffective. Microbial contamination was recognized and the organism responsible was identified using standard microbiological methods. The use of an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture as the microbial inhibitor in the ACS + PBS + HA lubricant created a sterile environment and thus very clinically relevant environment for wear testing. The content of this thesis represents a comprehensive data collection on retrieval analysis and lubricant-specific knee simulator wear testing of modular total knee replacements. A more clinically relevant lubricant composition for simulator wear testing was proposed (U. S. patent Serial number 60 / 899, 894; pending since February 9 th, 2007) that improved upon the current guideline from the International Standards Organization for knee simulator wear testing. The present thesis should serve as a guide for the surgeon, researcher and the implant manufacturer to evaluate retrieved implant components and to select lubricant additives for wear testing that closely mimics the in vivo wear conditions...|$|R
