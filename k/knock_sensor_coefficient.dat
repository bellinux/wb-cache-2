The {{aim is to}} studythe quality of the signal from <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> and how the signal for engine control is affected at different sensor locations on Scanias, engine DC 13. To find out at witch position on the engine youcan get a usable signal for engine control, the engine is running while the <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> with advanced measurement equipment {{is connected to the}} engine. Evaluation of signals from the <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> are made in the computer program Matlab. The program is producing a seriesof plots, from these plots it is visually possible to draw conclusions and find connections. It turns out that there isone special sensor placement which gives measurements that stand out from the restand opens the possibility for further studies...|$|R

50|$|Higher {{compression}} ratios will however make gasoline engines {{subject to}} engine knocking (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> are not present {{to modify the}} ignition timing. However, <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> have been a requirement of the OBD-II specification used in 1996 model year vehicles and newer.|$|R
5000|$|The 3MZ-FE is a 3.3 L (3310 cc) version. Bore is 92 mm {{and stroke}} is 83 mm. Output is [...] with 240 lbft Nm of torque in the Camry and [...] with 242 lbft Nm of torque in the Sienna and Highlander. It also {{features}} VVT-i, ETCS-i (Electronic Throttle Control System â€” intelligent/DBW), PA6 plastic intake, and increased throttle body diameter over the 1MZ. The 3MZ uses a new flat-type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{which is a}} departure from the typical resonator type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> used on the previous MZs. Previous MZs had poor knock control, or perhaps oversensitivity when detecting knock, and power loss up to [...] may be realized due to erratic ignition timing when using an octane lower than 91. The new flat-type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> is a completely different design and detects more frequencies than the traditional resonator type. This provides the ECU with more accurate data. A bolt goes {{through the center of the}} <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> which then mates the sensor to the block on each bank.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{provided}} on an engine cylinder block to detect abnormal engine combustion (knocking) {{and to provide}} feedback to engine control unit (ECU). The ECU then modifies the engine input and avoids knocking. A commonly used <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> is an accelerometer that detects cylinder wall vibration and estimates knocking of the engine. Selecting {{the location of a}} <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> in many cases involves a challenging trial and error approach that depends upon the measurement of the knock signal at many locations on engine structure. However, a cylinder block exhibits many structural resonances. Thus, a large vibration signal at the surface of cylinder block can be either due to knocking of the engine or due to the resonances of the cylinder block structure because of normal excitation forces. Hence, this conventional method does not always yield reliable results. The aim of the work reported in this paper is to experimentally determine the inherent dynamic characteristics of a cylinder block and to combine this with a calculation of the fundamental knock frequency and, thus, to identify the optimum location for the <b>knock</b> <b>sensor...</b>|$|R

50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} ignition coils {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the ignition coils and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a camshaft position <b>sensor</b> or separate <b>knock</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Saab Full Pressure Turbo (FPT) {{models with}} this unit include the APC name {{displayed}} on a non-numeric boost pressure gauge in the instrument panel. Although <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> are common even on non-turbocharged and turbocharged engines today, Saab has continued to use the APC name prominently as a differentiating feature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knock</b> <b>sensors</b> {{have been}} {{eliminated}} by utilizing the [...] "ionic current" [...] measuring system. Using the ionic current system, engine misfires as well as knock can be measured simultaneously. The ionic current is measured by passing a low voltage across the spark plugs immediately following the ignition spark.|$|R
5000|$|To detect knock, a {{piezoelectric}} <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> (basically a microphone) {{bolted to}} the engine block responds to unique frequencies caused by engine <b>knock.</b> The <b>sensor</b> generates a small voltage that {{is sent to the}} electronic control unit, which processes the signal to determine if, in fact, knock is occurring. If it is, then the control unit activates a solenoid valve that directs boost pressure to the turbocharger's pneumatically controlled wastegate actuator, which opens the wastegate to bypass exhaust gases from the turbocharger directly to the exhaust pipe, lowering turbo boost pressure until the knock subsides. Knock events that are managed by the APC can be [...] "seen" [...] when the in-dash boost needle [...] "twitches" [...] slightly. The APC unit has a 'knock' output where an LED may be connected. This LED will then light up if knock is detected. The pictured APC gauge has this custom LED fitted {{at the end of the}} red scale. Because the <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> becomes less accurate at high revolutions, the APC tapers maximum boost pressure after approximately 4,500 RPM.|$|R
50|$|The most {{typically}} used engine management systems found in automobiles today have a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> that monitors if knock is being {{produced by the}} fuel being used.

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) engines lack direct in-cylinder mechanisms, such as spark plugs or direct fuel injection, for controlling the combustion timing. Many indirect {{methods have been}} used to control the combustion timing in an HCCI engine.

In this paper, it is shown that microphones and <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> can be used to detect combustion in HCCI engines. The output from various microphones and a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> on an HCCI engine are measured at light and high loads.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} Bayesian analysis for Cox 2 Ì† 7 s proportional hazard model with error {{effect on the}} study of Accelerated Life Testing. We make statistical inference under Bayesian methods by using the well known Markov chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) techniques to estimate the parameters involved in the model and predict reliability (or survival) in accelerated life testing. We apply this method to the analysis of the <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> failure data (<b>knocking</b> vibration from the cylinder block is sensed as vibrational pressure by the <b>Knock</b> <b>Sensor),</b> in which some observations in the data are censored. The study was realized on Delphi Design Center located in Juarez, Mexico. The failure times at a constant stress level are assumed to be from a Weibull distribution. The analysis of the data from ALT will be made for the posterior estimation of parameters and prediction of survival function as well as the comparisons with the classical results from the Arrhenius model. ...|$|R
5000|$|Digifant was {{introduced}} in 1986 on the 2.1 litre Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) (Vanagon in the US) engine. This system combined digital fuel control as used in the earlier Digi-Jet systems with a new digital ignition system.

Digifant as used in Volkswagen Golf and Volkswagen Jetta models simplified several functions, and added <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> control to the ignition system. Other versions of Digifant appeared on the Volkswagen Fox, Corrado, Volkswagen Transporter (T4) (known as the Eurovan in North America), as well as 1993 and later production versions of the rear-engined Volkswagen Beetle, sold only in Mexico. Lower-power versions (without a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor),</b> supercharged, and 16-valve variants were produced.

40|$|Todayâ€™s {{spark-ignition}} engine works {{more and more}} on knocking limit because of higher requirements on consumption, exhaust-gas limits and engine power. Heavy knocking can damage the engine permanently. Therefore it is necessary to prevent <b>knocking.</b> The <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> signal consists of many components. A knocking combustion creates one component in the <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> signal. But the signal contains also disturbing noise by normal combustion and mechanical vibration of other engine components. This disturbing noise can influence the knock detection. A false detected knocking doesnâ€™t damage the engine, but decreases the performance. The influence of the components piston and valve on the knock detection is analysed in this paper. A possibility to calibrate the knock detection with time-frequency analysis is presented. On this way, the influences of the disturbing noise of the components on the knock detection are mitigated.

50|$|The {{flagship}} turbocharged, fuel-injected and non-intercooled {{variant of}} the E5 was the E5T.
