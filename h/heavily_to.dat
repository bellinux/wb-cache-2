5|$|After {{suffering}} {{from a heart attack}} during prayer at Soepomo's home on 19 July 1985, Sjumandjaja was brought to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta. He died at 3:50p.m. local time (UTC+7) and was buried the following day at Kawi-Kawi Public Cemetery. He left behind a nearly finished film, Jakarta Opera, which had been exerting himself <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> complete. It was later completed by Sutomo Gandasubrata.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> the album's electronic feel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|The Jeita grotto {{contributes}} <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> {{the public}} {{life of the}} region. MAPAS, the firm which runs the grotto, is an important employer and provides full-time jobs for around 115 local residents of Jeita (30% of which are female). In addition to employment, the Jeita caves contribute 5% of ticket fees to the local municipality, between 10 and 20% of general revenue to the Lebanese ministry of tourism, and an additional 10% of ticket fees along with the 10% VAT to the Lebanese ministry of Finance.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 7 July, {{she sank}} the 5,116 ton American Hog Islander Alcoa Ranger, also from Convoy PQ 17. A single torpedo struck the ship, causing the vessel to list <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> starboard. The crew {{abandoned}} ship in three lifeboats within 15 minutes. After she questioned the crew, {{she began to}} shell the ship {{from a distance of}} about , firing at least 60 shells (some survivors said as many as 150) until the ship sank. The crewmen were rescued by Soviet patrol boats later that day.|$|E

5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much {{power to the}} high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> {{the collapse of the}} Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E
5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.|$|E
5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> support the British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start}} of the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E

5|$|Four {{businessmen}} were {{emblematic of}} the 1920s and 30s boom years— H. Roy Cullen, H. L. Hunt, Sid W. Richardson, and Clint Murchison. Cullen was a self-educated cotton and real-estate businessman who moved to Houston in 1918 and soon began oil prospecting. Cullen's success led to his founding the South Texas Petroleum Company (with partner Jim West Sr.) and Quintana Oil Company. Cullen and his wife established the Cullen Foundation, which {{became one of the}} largest charitable organizations in the state, and donated <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> the University of Houston, the Texas Medical Center, and numerous other causes in Texas, particularly in the Houston area.|$|E
5|$|Francisco de Montejo {{meanwhile}} borrowed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> finance his {{expedition to}} Honduras, offering his extensive holdings in Mexico as guarantee on the loans, {{as well as}} selling some of his property outright. He announced his expedition in Mexico City and in Santiago de Guatemala, and attracted large numbers of recruits, whom he equipped often at his own cost. Additionally, he purchased ships at Veracruz. In 1537, Francisco de Montejo took up the post of governor, and annulled those encomiendas distributed by Pedro de Alvarado. This resulted in Alvarado's supporters resisting Montejo and his appointees. Montejo assigned Alonso de Cáceres as his captain in Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Fund-raising for {{the center}} was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton's who had also contributed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> the Clinton-Gore {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E

5|$|Karpf {{ordered the}} slow Albatross {{to make for}} neutral Swedish waters, where {{theoretically}} she would be protected from the Russian attack, while he tried to escape with Augsburg to the south. Soon, all four Russian cruisers were firing at Albatross, allowing Augsburg and the torpedo boats to escape freely. At 07:20, Albatross was hit for the first time. As the range closed, the Russian ships came close enough that Albatross could reply with her 8.8guns, but {{by this time the}} Russian fire was beginning to take its toll. The forecastle was riddled with holes, the foremast was knocked down, and the conning tower was destroyed, killing the men inside. At 07:45, Albatross entered Swedish territorial waters, but the Russians continued firing for another twenty minutes, checking their fire only at 08:07 after the ship had Östergarn Sound. By this time, the ship was badly damaged and was listing <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> port. Fearing that the ship would capsize, her captain ordered her to be beached.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 1809 Agamemnon, {{along with}} the rest of the {{squadron}} (which was now under the command of Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy), put into Maldonado Bay for the third and final time, to shelter from a storm. While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal. Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship's boats, together with the stream and kedge anchors, to pull the ship off, but to no avail. The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously, and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded, the anchor having pierced the hull. On 17 June, with the ship listing <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> starboard, Agamemnons stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron, and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{received}} its shoulder sleeve insignia on 19 March 2007 and its distinctive unit insignia on 8 November 2007. The insignia alludes <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> the unit's {{history with the}} 82d Airborne Division. In 2015 the brigade ceased being a separate unit and {{became part of the}} 82d Airborne Division. As a division unit, its personnel adopted the division's shoulder sleeve insignia and the maroon beret with a brigade-specific flash; however, most of the brigade's personnel are not on jump status and only wear the maroon beret and shoulder sleeve insignia because these are unit uniform items.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe <b>heavily</b> <b>to</b> limit movement.|$|E
