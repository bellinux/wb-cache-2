For {{the majority of}} their career, the lineup featured Martin Smith on vocals and guitar, Stu G (full name Stuart Garrard) on guitar and backing vocals, Jon Thatcher on bass guitar, Tim Jupp on keys and piano, and Stew Smith on drums and percussion. During their final two years, drumming duties were assumed by Paul Evans.|$|E

Between 1997 and 2001, the band targeted the majority of its work towards a mainstream audience, with several singles reaching the top 20 on the UK music charts. However, [...] between 2003 and 2009 the focus was mainly placed on the CCM market, although occasional singles were still released.|$|E

40|$|We {{proposed}} a minimal model {{to describe the}} Floquet band structure of two-dimensional materials with light-induced resonant inter-band transition. We applied it to graphene to study the band features caused by the light irradiation. Linearly polarized light induces pseudo gaps (gaps are functions of wavevector), and circularly polarized light causes real gaps on the quasi-energy spectrum. If the polarization of light is linear and along the longitudinal direction of zigzag ribbons, flat <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> appear in the pseudo gaps, and if is in the lateral direction of armchair ribbons, curved <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> can be found. For the circularly polarized cases, <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> arise and intersect in the gaps of both types of ribbons. The <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> induced by the circularly polarized light are helical and those by linearly polarized light are topologically trivial ones. The Chern number of the Floquet band, which reflects the number of pairs of helical <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> in graphene ribbons, can be reduced into the winding number at resonance.

50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>banding</b> is used {{to cover}} the exposed sides of {{materials}} such as plywood, particle board or MDF, increasing durability and giving {{the appearance of a}} solid or more valuable material. Common substitutes for edgebanding include face frames or molding. <b>Edge</b> <b>banding</b> can be made of different materials including PVC, ABS, acrylic, melamine, wood or wood veneer.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> was {{a manual}} process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|R

40|$|Composite {{materials}} and wooden dowels {{are being used}} increasingly {{in the construction of}} furniture frames and inner decoration. Yet there is little information available concerning the withdrawal strength of various fasteners, and, in particular, dowels in composite materials edged solid wood edge bandings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the withdrawal strengths of 6, 8, 10 mm diameter dowels produced from beech with respect to edge of a medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or particleboard (PB) edged with 5, 10 and 15 mm thickness of solid wood <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> of uludag fir, bonded with different adhesives. According to TS 4539 standard, the effects of <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> thickness, dimension of dowels, type of composite {{materials and}} type of adhesives used for <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> on the withdrawal strength were determined. The highest (6. 37 N/mmÂ²) withdrawal strength was obtained in beech dowels with 8 mm diameter for MDF with 5 mm thickness of solid wood <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> of uludag fir bonded with D-VTKA adhesive. According to results, if the hole wall and the surface of dowel are smooth then the adhesives give better mechanical adhesion with dowels and composite materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} {{cellular}} radio ICs {{lies in the}} integration of an ever-increasing number of bands and channel bandwidths. This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 9 WCDMA bands (l-VI and Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high bands (HB) and 2 low bands (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 4 for the WCDMA bands...|$|R
