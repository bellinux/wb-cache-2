40|$|Information {{technology}} {{is being used}} to collect data directly from patients and to provide educational information to them. Concern over patient reactions to this use of information {{technology is}} especially important in light of the debate over whether computers dehumanize patients. This study reports reactions that patient users expressed in ethnographic interviews about using a computer-based telecommunications system. The interviews were conducted {{as part of a larger}} evaluation of Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) -HealthCall, an <b>intelligent</b> interactive <b>telephone</b> advisor, that advised individuals about how to improve their health through changes in diet or exercise. Interview findings suggest that people formed personal relationships with the TLC system. These relationships ranged from feeling guilty about their diet or exercise behavior to feeling love for the voice. The findings raise system design and user interface issues as well as research and ethical questions...|$|R
50|$|A {{service control}} point (SCP) is a {{standard}} component of the <b>Intelligent</b> Network (IN) <b>telephone</b> system {{which is used to}} control the service. Standard SCPs in the telecom industry today are deployed using SS7, SIGTRAN or SIP technologies. The SCP queries the service data point (SDP) which holds the actual database and directory. SCP, using the database from the SDP, identifies the geographical number to which the call is to be routed. This is the same mechanism that is used to route 800 numbers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It’s {{based on}} the voice {{value-added}} business booming and combined with the value-added service of mobile and network so that the fixed <b>telephone</b> <b>intelligent</b> voice service system is put forward in the paper. The system is constituted with voice rafting business and fixed telephone business like “we chat”, which is constructed by voice acquisition, number identification, voice feedback and customer information processing module. The rafting business is devoted to solve the difficulty that the users have communication impediment in different time domain. And the business is used availably for work and amusement through orientation conveying or not. The applied range of “we chat ” is broadened because of the fixed telephone business like “we chat”. The fixed telephone business like “we chat ” is realized by the store-and-forward way to achieve the communication with real time and different time domain. The birth of the new business model will bring consumers the different experience and feelings.
