2500|$|When it was rereleased in 2001 as Super Mario Advance it {{received}} generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 84% on Metacritic. One reviewer concluded [...] "all nostalgia and historical influence aside, Super Mario Bros. 2 {{is still a}} game worth playing {{on the merits of}} its gameplay alone", also saying that [...] "the only reason {{you may not want to}} pick it up is <b>if</b> ... <b>you</b> <b>already</b> own it in another form." [...] However, GameSpot thought that Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World would have been a better choice for a launch game considering their respective popularity; both titles were eventually also remade as part of the Super Mario Advance series. Conversely, IGN praised the choice, calling it [...] "one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era". The game was named one of the NES best games ever by IGN, saying that the game offers greater diversity in graphics and gameplay than the original, making it a great bridge game between the other NES Mario titles. ScrewAttack named Wart's battle theme in a list of the top ten best 8-Bit Final Boss Themes.|$|E
