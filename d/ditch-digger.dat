25|$|He {{was sent}} to Shattuck Military Academy, where his father had studied before him. Brando excelled at theatre and did well in the school. In his final year (1943), he was put on {{probation}} for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers. He was confined to his room, but sneaked into town and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, though he {{was supported by the}} students, who thought expulsion was too harsh. He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. Brando worked as a <b>ditch-digger</b> as a summer job arranged by his father. He tried to enlist in the Army, but his induction physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at Shattuck had left him with a trick knee. He was classified 4-F and not inducted.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, a Surratt {{neighbor}} told US {{military authorities}} that he overheard {{one of the}} Surratt's servants saying that three men {{had come to the}} house on the night of Lincoln's assassination and that one of the men had mentioned Booth in a theater. (The servant was mistaken about the date, as John Surratt, Jr. had indeed been in Elmira, New York, on a mission for a Confederate general). Other pieces of information also mentioned the boarding house as a key meeting place of the possible conspirators. Either Colonel Henry H. Wells, Provost Marshal (head of the military police) of the District of Columbia, or General Christopher C. Augur told Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to arrest everyone in the house. Federal soldiers visited the Surratt boarding house again late on the evening of April 17. John, Jr., could not be found, but after a search of the house, the agents found in Mary's room a picture of Booth, hidden behind another photograph, pictures of Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis, a pistol, a mold for making bullets, and percussion caps. As Mary was being arrested for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Powell appeared at her door in disguise. Although Surratt denied knowing him, Powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by Surratt to dig a ditch the next morning. The discrepancy and Powell's unusually well-groomed appearance, quite unlike a <b>ditch-digger,</b> prompted his arrest. He was later identified as the man who had attempted to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward.|$|E
500|$|Without Herold {{to guide}} him, Powell {{did not find}} {{his way back to}} the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a <b>ditch-digger</b> hired by Mary Surratt, but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland, about [...] {{northwest}} of Washington, where he was arrested April 20.|$|E
6000|$|The {{strength}} of the union today, other things remaining equal, is proportionate to the skill of the trade, or, in other words, proportionate to the pressure the surplus labor army can put upon it. If a thousand <b>ditch-diggers</b> strike, {{it is easy to}} replace them, wherefore the <b>ditch-diggers</b> have little or no organized strength. But a thousand highly skilled machinists are somewhat harder to replace, and in consequence the machinist unions are strong. The <b>ditch-diggers</b> are wholly {{at the mercy of the}} surplus labor army, the machinists only partly. To be invincible, a union must be a monopoly. It must control every man in its particular trade, and regulate apprentices so that the supply of skilled workmen may remain constant; this is the dream of the [...] "Labor Trust" [...] on the part of the captains of labor.|$|R
50|$|Trying to calm down, {{taking a}} walk, John happens across {{a team of}} actual <b>ditch-diggers</b> from a WPA project. He asks foreman Manuel for a job, but a {{suspicious}} Manuel turns the well-dressed stranger down. Manuel's lovely daughter Osa advises the new man to change his appearance. In work clothes, digging voluntarily, John gets the job.|$|R
50|$|It was {{performed}} {{at the close of}} the 2010 Olympic ceremony in Vancouver, conducted live by Valery Gergiev, to present the 2014 Winter Olympics, which were held in Sochi, Russia. At the 2014 opening ceremony in Sochi, the theme was used again during a scene depicting national industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union. The dancers wore red and black costumes while they interacted with huge figurative tractors, giant <b>ditch-diggers,</b> gears, and similar engine parts. The Russian rhythmic gymnastics team used the Overture in their gold medal winning all-around routine at the 2016 Summer Olympics.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} after noon that the Woggle-Bug hired as a <b>ditch-digger</b> {{in order to win}} his heart's desire; so at noon on the second day he quit work, and having {{received}} eight silver dollars he put on his coat and rushed away to the store that he might purchase his intended bride.|$|E
6000|$|The {{lower the}} {{employment}} in the industrial scale, the harder the conditions. The finer, the more delicate, the more skilled the trade, the higher is it lifted above the struggle. There is less pressure, less sordidness, less savagery. There are fewer glass-blowers proportionate {{to the needs of}} the glass-blowing industry than there are ditch-diggers proportionate {{to the needs of the}} ditch-digging industry. And not only this, for it requires a glass-blower to take the place of a striking glass-blower, while any kind of a striker or out-of-work can take the place of a <b>ditch-digger.</b> So the skilled trades are more independent, have more individuality and latitude. They may confer with their masters, make demands, assert themselves. The unskilled laborers, on the other hand, have no voice in their affairs. The settlement of terms is none of their business. [...] "Free contract" [...] is all that remains to them. They may take what is offered, or leave it. There are plenty more of their kind. They do not count. They are members of the surplus labor army, and must be content with a hand-to-mouth existence.|$|E
50|$|Fred Eaton {{taught himself}} {{engineering}} {{and was the}} superintendent of the Los Angeles City Water Company by age 19 in 1875. As head of the Water Company, in 1878 Eaton first hired William Mulholland as a <b>ditch-digger</b> for distribution canals from the Los Angeles River to the city.|$|E
60|$|But these {{hereditary}} inefficients do {{not alone}} compose the surplus labor army. There are the skilled but unsteady and unreliable men; {{and the old}} men, once skilled, but, with dwindling powers, no longer skilled. {3} And there are good men, too, splendidly skilled and efficient, but thrust out of the employment of dying or disaster-smitten industries. In this connection it {{is not out of}} place to note the misfortune of the workers in the British iron trades, who are suffering because of American inroads. And, last of all, are the unskilled laborers, the hewers of wood and drawers of water, the <b>ditch-diggers,</b> the men of pick and shovel, the helpers, lumpers, roustabouts. If trade is slack on a seacoast of two thousand miles, or the harvests are light in a great interior valley, myriads of these laborers lie idle, or make life miserable for their fellows in kindred unskilled employments.|$|R
50|$|When Irish-born Margaret first disembarked into Antebellum New Orleans {{during the}} cotton-boom era of commerce, she {{along with other}} waves of new Irish {{immigrants}} sought work and opportunity in Louisiana. The city of contrasts was dubbed the city of fever and fortune, a port of pestilence and prosperity. Moving away from wharf work, Irish immigrant male laborers took jobs that slaves were judged too valuable to do, such as canal <b>ditch-diggers,</b> levee-builders and rail-hands laying tracks through swampland. During construction of the city’s New Basin Canal (shipping canal), the Irish accepted the hazardous and backbreaking work for a $1 a day wages. Although no official death-toll records were kept, an estimated 20,000 (+/-) workers perished during the project, most buried on the spot. Many widows and orphans were left. Poor and living in slums, the Irish were particularly susceptible {{to a series of}} epidemics that periodically swept the city. The Great Famine of Ireland peaked and those fleeing Ireland found cheap passage to port-city New Orleans. Irish immigrants were drawn to Louisiana's Catholic traditions, first established when France and Spain ruled the territory, prior to the Louisiana Purchase. By 1860, 14 percent of New Orleans' population was Irish. The city was home to the third largest Irish population in the country. Irish women were a unique female immigrant group, vulnerable to ethnic and cultural stereotyping, as single women often traveled and lived together in groups, atypical to the pre-existing framework for Southern ladies.|$|R
50|$|Molly Kelly (Viola Dana) {{intends to}} marry a millionaire. When she meets Andy Charles, Jr. (Ralph Graves), heir to a {{restaurant}} fortune, she sees her chance and marries him. Upon discovering the marriage, Andy's father (Burr McIntosh) becomes irate and disinherits his son. Andy attempts life as a <b>ditch-digger</b> to support his wife, but the results are not what he had hoped for.|$|E

He told detectives waiting there that he was a <b>ditch-digger</b> hired by Mary Surratt, but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested.

5000|$|During {{his time}} at Haverford, Coleman took a sabbatical in which he put his {{academic}} work to the test by working a variety of blue-collar jobs, including <b>ditch-digger,</b> garbageman, prison warden (and inmate), and [...] "salad-and-sandwich man" [...] at Union Oyster House. He wrote about these experiences for New York magazine and in a book, Blue-Collar Journal: A College President's Sabbatical, awarded the Athenaeum of Philadelphia Literary Award for 1974, among other honors. It was made into the television movie The Secret Life of John Chapman.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 Savage {{was devastated}} by the deaths of both his sister Rose and his closest brother Joe. He adopted Joe's name and became known as Michael Joseph Savage from then on. After losing his job in 1893, Savage moved to New South Wales, finding work as a {{labourer}} and irrigation <b>ditch-digger</b> in Narrandera for seven years. Whilst there, he joined the General Labourers' Union and became familiar with the radical political theories of the Americans Henry George and Edward Bellamy, who influenced his political policies in later life.|$|E
50|$|Born in {{the village}} of Dilyalevo, Vologda Governorate Russian Empire as the {{youngest}} of 11 children in a peasant family, the largely self-taught Ilyushin left home at an early age. He worked as a factory laborer, <b>ditch-digger</b> at construction sites, and cleaner of gutters at a dye plant in Petrograd. In 1910, he learned that jobs were available at Kolomyazhsky Racetrack as a groundskeeper. The racetrack was also the site of the first All-Russia Festival of Ballooning in autumn of 1910, and Ilyushin assisted in unpacking crates and setting up equipment. He was also able to meet many of Russia's pioneer aviators, an event that awoke his interest in aviation.|$|E
5000|$|Boddy's {{career was}} called by Art Berman of the Los Angeles Times a [...] "classic example of the self-made man, with his early years marked by poverty." [...] Boddy's {{university}} years were interspersed with periods of working as a [...] "door-to-door flatiron salesman, ditch digger, janitor and miner." [...] He was also a milker, <b>ditch-digger,</b> janitor, recruiter for the University of Montana, and New York City subway guard, then an Encyclopædia Britannica salesman in that city, where he persuaded poor families to band together to buy the volumes. In Massachusetts, he evaded a ban on book salesmen at Harvard University by hiring students as his agents. He was then promoted to sales manager for the encyclopedia.|$|E

He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school. Brando worked as a <b>ditch-digger</b> as a summer job arranged by his father.

5000|$|Scrooge {{earned the}} dime in 1877 in his {{hometown}} of Glasgow, when he started working as a shoeshine boy on his tenth birthday. Before that it belonged to Howard Rockerduck (the father of John D. Rockerduck). The customer who paid it to him, a <b>ditch-digger</b> called Burt, seemingly [...] "cheated" [...] Scrooge. In reality, Scrooge's father, Fergus McDuck, gave Burt the dime specifically for paying Scrooge for his services. Scrooge McDuck never learned that fact, although Fergus did reveal it to Scrooge's sisters Matilda and Hortense. Burt and Magica De Spell, who learned about this when she traveled in time to the day Scrooge earned the Dime, are the only other ones who know. McDuck kept it as a reminder not to be fooled again in the future. When he emigrated to the US three years later, he carried it with him. Scrooge still has the dime and keeps it on a pillow under glass because of its sentimental value. Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Gladstone Gander among many others think it is really a lucky charm, but Scrooge himself rejects any claims beyond sentimentality.|$|E

5000|$|Born near St. Marys, Ohio to James Dennis and Bridget Marie Lawler Tully, an Irish {{immigrant}} <b>ditch-digger</b> and his wife, Tully {{enjoyed a}} relatively happy but impoverished childhood until {{the death of}} his mother in 1892. Unable to care for him, his father sent him to an orphanage in Cincinnati. He remained there for six years. What further education he acquired came in the hobo camps, boxcars, railroad yards, and public libraries scattered across the country. Finally, weary of the road, he arrived in Kent, Ohio, where he worked as a chain maker, professional boxer, and tree surgeon. He also began to write, mostly poetry published in the local newspapers. He moved to Hollywood in 1912, when he began writing in earnest. His literary career took two distinct paths. He {{became one of the first}} reporters to cover Hollywood. As a free-lancer he was not constrained by the studios and wrote about Hollywood celebrities (including Charlie Chaplin, for whom he had worked) in ways that they did not always find agreeable. For these pieces, rather tame by current standards, he became known as the most-hated man in Hollywood—a title he relished. Less lucrative but closer to his heart were the books he wrote about his life on the road and the American underclass. He also wrote an affectionate memoir of his childhood with his extended Irish family, as well as novels on prostitution, boxing, Hollywood, and a travel book. While some of the more graphic books ran afoul of the censors, they also garnered both commercial success and critical acclaim from, among others, H.L. Mencken, George Jean Nathan, and Rupert Hughes, who wrote that Tully [...] "has fathered the school of hard-boiled writing so zealously cultivated by Ernest Hemingway and lesser luminaries." ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction It is well {{understood}} that hackers and other computer criminals operate outside of normal office hours. This paper {{will present the}} events and subsequent repercussions of a weekend in April 1991. At the time I {{was working at the}} University of London Computer Centre and had established a working relationship with several groups involved in the investigation of intrusions to computer systems. What is a Hacker? The term "hacker" has come to mean anyone who makes use of a data network to misuse a computer system. The term has acquired many meanings, including, a creative programmer, one who illicitly breaks into computers, a novice golfer who digs up the course, a taxi-cab driver, an inferior journalist, and <b>ditch-digger.</b> Confusion between the first two interpretations results in the perception that one need be brilliant or creative to break into computers. This may not be true. Many troublemakers are patient and plodding. They use the same few techniques ove...|$|E
40|$|You have an {{architect}} and a <b>ditch-digger</b> {{working together on}} a construction project. Who gets paid more, and why?” Does a tendency toward abstraction and quantification, a pretense of objectivity, obscure the character, situation and bias from which all economic and political theorems stem? Following the principle that arguments neither arise nor persist in a vacuum, that they live and die by their context and character, we can describe two sorts of response corresponding to two rather timeless worldviews, along with their accompanying “mind-sets”. The degree to which these views indicate differing “kinds” in human nature, beyond which {{there can be no}} further reduction to common ground, whether conversely they simply reflect historical and economic circumstance, or to what extent they are both, will be left to the reader. One might discern in the sensibilities described some alignment along traditional epithets of “bourgeois” vs. “working class”, but this is not necessarily so. I will therefore avoid overwrought labels, but admit that such family resemblances speak to a longer historical view and a persistent problematic...|$|E
