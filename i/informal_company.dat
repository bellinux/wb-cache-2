25|$|As {{the son of}} Colley Cibber, one of the theatre's managers, Theophilus became {{involved}} in the management of Drury Lane. In 1723, he became manager of the summer season, and in 1727 became assistant manager during the regular season. In 1732, one of the managers, Barton Booth, sold his share to John Highmore, and another of the managers, Robert Wilks, fell ill and died. Cibber senior became disenchanted by the involvement of Wilks' widow, through her representative John Ellys, in the management of the company. He dropped out of the management and leased his share in the company to his son. Cibber junior took the lead in the management of the theatre during the 1732–33 season, until he fell ill. The actions of Ellys and Highmore in his absence, which appear to have been largely centred on saving or making money, irritated Theophilus and friction grew between them. The other managers approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Colley Cibber sold them his share for 3,000 guineas, and they promptly gave Theophilus his notice. Theophilus led the actors in a walkout and they set themselves up as rival, but <b>informal,</b> <b>company</b> of players in the Haymarket. The Cibbers applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused, and the Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down Cibber by conspiring in the arrest of his leading actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy. Public opinion swung to Theophilus' side, and Harper was released. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on his own terms.|$|E

Sverdrup & Parcel was awarded both contracts, valued at $42,000 and $43,000 respectively.

40|$|In {{this case}} study {{performed}} on the industrial sub-sector of manufacture of leather shoes in Bolivia, we use the Hsieh and Klenow model (2008) to determine the differences between productivity of larger and formal companies and productivity of smaller and <b>informal</b> <b>companies.</b> Our results reveal {{that there are not}} many differences in terms of productivity among these types of companies. We think that informality is indeed the most important factor that contributes to this phenomenon. Apparently, the decrease in costs associated with informality compensates to some extend the economies of scale of formal companies with bigger dimensions and better technology. A notable fact in the shoe manufacturing industry is that it had experienced an atomization process in the last years. This trend is the consequence of a progressive creation of many small <b>informal</b> <b>companies</b> instead of the consolidation of this industry in medium and large formal companies. In a way, informality has contributed to this process. First, because it allows the survival of less productive companies that if they were not informal, they would have to bear costs that would not allow them to continue in business. Second, because informality creates strong incentives for employees to start their own business. In the other hand, many costs associated to formality discourage legally operating companies to employ more people, raise capital and growth. Productivity, Informality, Bolivia...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{studies the}} effects of business informality in terms of distortions in resource absorption, particularly labor, by <b>informal</b> <b>companies.</b> It also assesses the consequences of lower demand for labor of informal firms over aggregate productivity. With firm level data from the DANE Micro-establishments Survey, a matching exercise between formal and informal firms is conducted. It {{was found that the}} latter hire fewer employees than formal firms with the same characteristics, including Total Factor Productivity. The matching results allow using counterfactual demands of labor of informal firms to calculate and compare the real and counterfactual aggregate productivity levels. The results indicate that if informal firms would demand the amount of employment demanded by similar formal firms, market share distributionof firms would improve and this would positively affect aggregate productivity.

These enterprises were not authorized deposit taking institutions under the Financial Institutions of Myanmar Law, but nevertheless accepted deposits by using the loophole of naming the depositors “shareholders.” They promised investors considerably higher interest rates than what private banks were offering (usually around 10% per year.). While these high rates, regularly reaching 3-4% per month, seemed hardly possible to return on a sustainable basis, large amount of investors used these entities nevertheless.

40|$|Objectives of the Study Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) have scarcely been researched {{from the point}} of view of language strategy. The objective of the study is to identify language strategies of Finnish SMEs doing business abroad and to analyze these strategies. The objectives were met through a survey directed at Finnish SMEs and face-to-face interviews with five case companies. Summary Languages are increasing important in the globalizing world, yet few companies have language strategies. The EU-wide PIMLICO Promotional Project investigated in summer 2010 top- performing international SMEs, which have adopted language strategies and use them for business purposes. The thesis writers collected data for the project in Finland. This thesis was undertaken with the consent of PIMLICO to further investigate this interesting topic. This thesis is based on continuous iteration between data, prior literature and the emerging theory. The empirical findings and academic literature suggest that language strategies in SMEs can include one or more of the following components: 1) common company language; 2) language audits; 3) language training; 4) recruitment; 5) translators and interpreters; 6) agents; and 7) company websites. Findings and Conclusion The researched SMEs do not have written language strategies, but they do have bottom-up language strategies. These language strategies emerge through recurrent language-related practices, such as using partners for translation, having an <b>informal</b> common <b>company</b> language and the use of native speakers as valuable resource...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present and discuss two {{possible}} ways of interpreting {{the organization of}} IT-consulting firms. These companies are described as organic in the literature, while they themselves describe their organizations as flat and organic. We base our two interpretations of this paradox on neo-institutional theory, which argue that the formal structure of organizations is mostly only loosely coupled to the <b>informal</b> structure. <b>Companies</b> have two different organizations: one implemented organization that organize the work that is actually performed (instrumental function) and one that the company shows to its groups of interests in order to legitimize itself (symbolic organization). The aim of the paper is to investigate whether the hierarchy has an instrumental or symbolic function for the organization. A traditional neo-institutional interpretation would probably imply that the hierarchy is the instrumental organization and the flatness is the symbolic – what we call “serious business”. An alternative and more likely interpretation is that the flatness is instrumental and the hierarchy is symbolic. Therefore, we argue that IT-companies better {{can be understood as}} “playgrounds”. Based on a study of six Swedish ITcompanies, we conclude that the organic structure as well as the hierarchy has an instrumental function for the organizations. Furthermore, we argue that both flat-ness and hierarchy are used as symbolic arguments, depending of group of target.

Abandoning the use of the often used diffusion approach within practice transfer studies, this article is set within the framework of translation theory, and takes readers through the journey of implementing a new recruitment practice, as well as discusses how this impacts the original idea to create “one company. ” It is claimed here that new knowledge was produced by bringing together the theoretical tradition of translation theory and placing it within the context of practice transfer. This claim will be supported by field data from a Swedish MNC and its European subsidiaries that has been undergoing a plethora of reorganizations within the branch of Human Resources for the past decade. One of the organizational changes, which will be the focal point of this study, is the implementation of a new recruitment process. This process was inspired by the MNC’s Americas office, revised at its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, and finally transferred to its respective European subsidiaries. These events were studied for a span of six months. The events and challenges are described and analyzed, followed by a discussion of unintended implications in which these circumstances brought onto the company.
