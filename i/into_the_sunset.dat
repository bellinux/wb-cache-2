By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sunset</b> Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was paved with bricks in 1913.
