40|$|Aim. To study {{changes of}} {{intercellular}} cooperation in peripheral blood induced by treatment {{in patients with}} arterial hypertension (HT), ischemic heart disease (IHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Material and methods. 610 patients were involved into the study, including 250 patients with HT of stages I-III (50 untreated patients), 150 patients with IHD and 210 patients with CHF of stages I-III. All patients were treated except 50 hypertensive ones. 80 healthy patients (40 men, 40 women) were included into control group. Blood smears of patients were evaluated (Romanovsky's stain). A number of leukocyte, autorosettes and autorosettes with erythrocyte lysis was calculated. The cellular association consisting of a neutrophil, monocyte or <b>eosinocyte</b> with 3 or more erythrocytes skintight to their surface defined as autorosettes. Erythrocytes number and hemoglobin level determined in peripheral blood. Results. Single autorosettes in peripheral blood were observed in patients of control group and in untreated patients with HT. Treated patients with HT, IHD and CHF had increased number of autorossets and autorosettes with erythrocytes lysis. This phenomenon resulted in reduction of erythrocytes number and hemoglobin level in peripheral blood. Conclusion. Treated patients with cardiologic diseases had changes in intercellular cooperation. It should be considered at intensive and long term therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Liver diseases, {{especially}} epidemic hepatitis were studied, {{employing the}} Oudin's precipitation {{test in the}} agar layer. And the results were as follows. 1. The auto-antibodies corresponding to the liver and kidney antigens were observed, by the Oudin's precipitation test in the agar layer, on 9 cases of acute hepatitis, 17 cases of chronic hepatitis, 6 cases of liver cirrhosis and other diseases. In liver diseases, it remarkably reacted to the liver antigen and showed many precipitation bands, and the precipitation band became numerous with the progress of disease in order of acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. On the other hand, it remarkably reacted to the kidney antigen and showed many precipitation bands, in kidney diseases. 2. Comparing each form on the classification of epidemic hepatitis {{with the results of}} the Oudin's precipitation test in the agar layer, the liver antigen remarkably reacted to the typical form, jaundiced form and influenza form and the precipitation band appeared few in the gastroenteric form, mixed form and latent form, in comparison with the former. On the other hand, the kidney antigen showed no difference on the number of precipitation band in each form of kidney diseases. 3. Comparing the number of days after the attack of epidemic hepatitis with the results of the Oudin's precipitation test in the agar layer by the liver antigen, the appearance of precipitation band was remarkably seen at 6 - 9 th month after the attack of disease and it became more remarkable at the chronic stadium and the shifting stadium to liver cirrhosis. 4. Comparing the liver function with the Oudin's precipitation test in the agar layer, the higher the positive serum colloidal reaction (the results judged on the serum Takata's test, Gross test, Weltman's test, thymol turbidity test, cobalt chloride test, colloidal red test, cephalin-cholesterol flocculation test and cadmium test etc.) became, the more was the number of precipitation band. No correlation between the above precipitation test and the hippuric acid test was observed, but there were some correlation between the above, precipitation test and the bromsulphalein test, and the appearance of precipitation band was remarkably observed on the cases with the liver function damage. 5. As for the relation of it with the blood picture, the more the precipitation band corresponding to the liver antigen appeared, the fewer were the hemoglobin value, erythrocyte, thrombocyte, leukocyte and monocyte count, and the more were the lymphocyte and <b>eosinocyte</b> count. 6. As for the relation of it with the serum protein value showed the declining tendency, the albumin value on the proportional picture of serum protein showed the decreasing tendency, the α-, β- globulin value slightly showed the decreasing tendency and the γ-globulin value showed the increasing tendency...|$|E
40|$|A 40 -year-old {{man who had}} {{occasionally}} felt {{abdominal pain}} due to unknown causes since his childhood was treated under the　provisional diagnosis of ideopathic　pancreatitis, because the increases of elastase Ⅰ were simultaneously related to his abdominal complaint without any other findings such as lithiasis, gastrointestinal disease, hyperparathyroidism etc. One day, soon after eating sukiyaki, he suffered from severe epigastralgia more than before. Next day, the laboratory date revealed that the IgE-RAST for egg white was positive and the ratio of <b>eosinocytes</b> in the patient's white blood cells was high, additionally increasing lipase, trypsin and elastase Ⅰ in serum. These clinical features suggest that this case of pancreatitis is related to an allergic reaction by egg white...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case of sclerosing lipogranuloma of the scrotum. A 42 -year-old man who had complained of a painless intrascrotal mass of one week's {{duration}} visited our clinic. Physical examination revealed a symmetrical Y-shaped hard mass around the penile base in the scrotum. Laboratory examination showed no abnormal findings except for a 14. 0 % eosinophilia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a surface coil showed an atypical mass at the penile base. Percutaneous needle biopsy under ultrasound guidance was performed and histopathological findings revealed lipogranuloma accompanied by infiltrating multinuclear giant cells, <b>eosinocytes</b> and lymphocytes. The tumor gradually disappeared during a 4 -week administration of antibiotics and antiphlogistics. We have also reviewed 95 cases of sclerosing lipogranuloma of the scrotum in the Japanese literature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Azadirachta excelsa or locally {{known as}} sentang are {{frequently}} {{used as a}} traditional medicine by diabetes patients in Malaysia. However, less {{attention has been given}} to their toxicity effect. Thus, the study is an attempt to examine the protective effect of A. excelsa on the pancreas and to determine possible toxicity mediated by the extract. Diabetes was induced experimentally in rats by high-fat-diet for 16 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at dosage of 35 mg/kg of body weight. Declination of the fasting blood glucose level was observed after continuous administration of A. excelsa for 14 days twice daily. This is due to the refining structure of the pancreas. However, surprisingly, the plant extract reduced the leukocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, MCHC and lymphocytes. In addition, the rat treated with the plant extract exhibited increment in AST and <b>eosinocytes</b> level. Overall, the finding shows that A. excelsa possesses antidiabetic activity by improving the structure of pancreatic islet of Langerhans but involved in ameliorating of hematology and biochemical parameters. Keywords—Azadirachta excelsa, diabetes, pancreas, hemato...|$|R
40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital because of gross hematuria, right lumbar pain and lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed hydronephrosis of the right kidney, irregular bladder wall thickening at the right lateral and posterior portion and external iliac lymph node swelling of the right side. Laboratory data revealed disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) and eosinophilia. Because she developed a high fever that was caused by acute obstructive pyelonephritis of the right kidney, percutaneous nephrostomy was placed and the therapy for DIC was initiated. Pathological examination of transurethral resection of bladder tumor performed twice showed no malignancy but inflammatory infiltration of many <b>eosinocytes,</b> leading to the diagnosis of eosinophilic cystitis (EC). We considered the possibility of allergic reaction to the drugs she was taking as the etiology of EC and discontinued all drugs. Although eosinophilia was resolved afterward, she then developed brain infarction, followed by cerebral hemorrhage. She was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for long-term care. CT scan that was performed 4 months after the initial presentation showed the resolution of hydronephrosis of the right kidney and external iliac lymph node swelling and the improvement of bladder wall thickness. Hydronephrosis of the right kidney has not recurred after removing the nephrostomy catheter. EC is a rare condition that could mimic an invasive bladder cancer. EC should be considered if bladder tumor is associated with eosinophilia. Therapeutic consideration for thromboembolic events should be made in patients with EC...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To make a {{retrospective}} analysis of endoscopy findings and clinicopathologic characteristics of colonic schistosomiasis {{in order to further}} improve our understanding of the disease and decrease its misdiagnosis. METHODS: Endoscopy findings and clinicopathologic characteristics of 46 intestinal schistosomiasis patients were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients underwent colonoscopy and all biopsy specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin were observed under a light microscope. RESULTS: Of the 46 colonic schistosomiasis patients, 1 was diagnosed as acute schistosomal colitis, 16 as chronic schistosomal colitis and 29 as chronic active schistosomal colitis according to their endoscopic findings and pathology. Not all patients were suspected of or diagnosed as colonic schistosomiasis. Of the 12 misdiagnosed patients, 4 were misdiagnosed as ulcerative colitis, 1 as Crohn’s disease, and 7 as ischemic colitis. The segments of rectum and sigmoid colon were involved in 29 patients (63. 0 %). Intact Schistosoma ova were deposited in colonic mucosa accompanying infiltration of <b>eosinocytes,</b> lymphocytes, and plasma cells in acute schistosomal colitis patients. Submucosal fibrosis was found in chronic schistosomal colitis patients. Among the 17 patients with a signal polyp, hyperplastic polyp, canalicular adenoma with a low-grade intraepithelial neoplastic change, tubulovillous adenoma with a high-grade intraepithelial neoplastic change were observed in 10, 5, and 2 patients, respectively. Eight out of the 46 patients were diagnosed as colonic carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy contributes to the diagnosis of colonic schistosomiasis although it is nonspecific. A correct diagnosis of colonic schistosomiasis can be established by endoscopy in combination with its clinicopathologic characteristics...|$|R
