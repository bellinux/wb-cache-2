The series was to conclude with a ninth volume but The <b>Dialectics</b> <b>of</b> Myth caused {{a great deal of}} controversy, and Losev never finished the final monograph.|$|R

25|$|Thus, {{even the}} {{smallest}} social actions contribute to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> control (discussed below) which allows them {{to break away from}} normative actions.

25|$|He was {{a leading}} member of the Frankfurt School of {{critical}} theory, whose work {{has come to be}} associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as <b>Dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.|$|E
25|$|Structuration theory allows {{researchers}} {{to focus on}} any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes ontology over epistemology. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, agent expectations, relative degrees of routine, tradition, behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and tacit knowledge, <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E
25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> reason.|$|E

25|$|Later in his life, Emerson's {{ideas on}} race changed {{when he became}} more {{involved}} in the abolitionist movement {{while at the same time}} he began to more thoroughly analyze the philosophical implications of race and racial hierarchies. His beliefs shifted focus to the potential outcomes of racial conflicts. Emerson's racial views were closely related to his views on nationalism and national superiority, specifically that of the Saxons of ancient England, which was a common view in the United States of that time. Emerson used contemporary theories of race and natural science to support a theory of race development. He believed that the current political battle and the current enslavement of other races was an inevitable racial struggle, one that would result in the inevitable union of the United States. Such conflicts were necessary for the <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> change that would eventually allow the progress of the nation. In much of his later work, Emerson seems to allow the notion that different races will eventually mix in America. This hybridization process would lead to a superior race that would be to the advantage of the superiority of the United States.|$|E

500|$|Commentators have {{identified}} numerous works as textual influences, including [...] Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral and Ash Wednesday, [...] Goethe's [...] Faust and [...] Wilfred Owen's [...] poem [...] "The Seed". Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp equates {{the ending of}} the oratorio to the closing pages of Part I of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in which Christian and Hopeful end their journey by crossing a deep and wide river to reach their heavenly home. The influence of Jungian themes is evident in the recurrent images of darkness and light, and the recognition and balancing of opposites. In a recent analysis of the work, Richard Rodda finds A Child of Our Time [...] "rooted in the essential <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> human life that Tippett so prized in Jung's philosophy—winter/spring, darkness/light, evil/good, reason/pity, dreams/reality, loneliness/fellowship, the man of destiny/the child of our time..." ...|$|E
500|$|Literary scholar Patricia Lee Yongue {{identifies}} Lincoln as {{the falling}} star. Further, she contrasts the <b>dialectic</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "powerful western falling star" [...] with a [...] "nascent spring" [...] and {{describes it as}} a metaphor for Lincoln's death meant to [...] "evoke powerful, conflicting emotions in the poet which transport him back to that first and continuously remembered rebellion signaling the death of his own innocence." [...] Biographer Betsy Erkkila writes that Whitman's star is [...] "the fallen star of America itself", and characterizes Whitman's association as [...] "politicopoetic myth to counter Booth's cry {{on the night of the}} assassination—Sic Semper Tyrannis—and the increasingly popular image of Lincoln as a dictatorial leader bent on abrogating rather than preserving basic American liberties". The star, seemingly immortal, is associated with Lincoln's vision for America—a vision of reconciliation and a national unity or identity that could only survive the president's death if Americans resolved to continue pursuing it. However, Vendler says that the poem dismisses the idea of a personal immortality through the symbol of the star, saying: [...] "the star sinks, and it is gone forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second phase}} of Frankfurt School {{critical}} theory centres principally on two works: Adorno and Horkheimer's <b>Dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment (1944) and Adorno's Minima Moralia (1951). The authors wrote both works during the Institute's exile in America. While retaining much of a Marxian analysis, in these works critical theory shifted its emphasis from the critique of capitalism to a critique of Western civilization as a whole, as seen in <b>Dialectic</b> <b>of</b> Enlightenment, which uses the [...] Odyssey as a paradigm for their analysis of bourgeois consciousness. In these works, Horkheimer and Adorno present many themes {{that have come to}} dominate the social thought of recent years; for instance, their exposition of the domination of nature as a central characteristic of instrumental rationality in Western civilization was made long before ecology and environmentalism had become popular concerns.|$|E
