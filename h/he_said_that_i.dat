2500|$|After her diagnosis, the {{following}} {{issue of the}} National Enquirer ran the headline: [...] "Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle". [...] Without asking for her comment, the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in It's Always Something: [...] "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on my family and my friends. [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good. [...] The Enquirer doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{footnote}} to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> remembered.|$|E
2500|$|Cage {{studied with}} Schoenberg for two years, but {{although}} he admired his teacher, {{he decided to}} leave after Schoenberg told the assembled students {{that he was trying}} to make it impossible for them to write music. Much later, Cage recounted the incident: [...] " [...] When <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> revolted, not against him, but against what he had said. I determined then and there, more than ever before, to write music." [...] Although Schoenberg was not impressed with Cage's compositional abilities during these two years, in a later interview, where he initially said that none of his American pupils were interesting, he further stated in reference to Cage: [...] "There was one...of course he's not a composer, but he's an inventorâ€”of genius." [...] Cage would later adopt the [...] "inventor" [...] moniker and deny that he was in fact a composer.|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>I</b> was {{thinking}} how elaborately everything was planned. I {{wondered how long}} he had the scheme in his head.|$|R
50|$|If <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> to me, <b>I</b> {{would run}} away.|$|R
6000|$|... "'If {{nothing else}} will satisfy {{you that you}} are entirely misinterpreting my motives,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't an idea of blaming you in the matter--read this.' ...|$|R
2500|$|O'Grady radioed {{for help}} {{immediately}} {{but had to}} remain quiet with paramilitaries coming within feet of him; he used the radio following standard operating procedures as the U.S. Air Force had taught him so not to give away his position to unfriendly forces. On his 6th night on the ground he made radio contact, signalling his location using his radio's limited battery power. NATO planes conducting sorties in the Balkans had been picking up beeper snippets that they thought could be coming from O'Grady. This extremely sensitive information was inadvertently revealed by General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, when the general told reporters attending a promotion ceremony that monitors had detected [...] "intermittent" [...] transmissions. A NATO official {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I was dumbfounded <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ROBERTS: 'I'm afraid I couldn't {{laugh when}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> don't believe I could laugh. It would make my blood run cold.' ...|$|E
60|$|Fost. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was ignorant, {{and did not}} {{understand}} the Scriptures; for how, said he, can you understand them when you know not the original Greek? &c.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} see change, I had to be active and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had to have a}} voice in Parliament if I wanted to improve the status of women.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{damage has}} been already done," [...] said the Doctor, eagerly. [...] "I have {{received}} the Bishop's rebuke,--a rebuke in which <b>he</b> has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have brought scandal upon the diocese." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{at any of}} the {{diplomatic}} receptions, I suppose," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> seeing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in earnest. [...] "He is rather a pal of Freddy's. Why don't you ring up and ask him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was not. I {{have never}} seen any one so serious. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to regard every fresh person {{who came into the}} house as a {{possible}} criminal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The minute <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a queer feelin' at the pit o' my stummick--I did, sure thing. 'It's {{a little}} early for a call,' I says, 'and I ain't in Sunday clothes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, somehow, when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> remembered, {{all of a}} sudden, {{the night}} of that dance and Willie {{brushing}} his hair before the looking-glass, and Myra sticking {{her head in the}} door to guy him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>I</b> {{might have been}} left behind. I ran to Foxie and vaulted upon him. A flash of yellow {{appeared}} among the sage {{and a string of}} yelps split the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{tell me what}} <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> died--what then? You {{must not}} be afraid of {{speaking}} of it openly. Why, Margaret, they have all {{told me that it}} must be in a month or two. What did Rubb say?" ...|$|R
60|$|He so {{thoroughly}} meant what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> involuntarily clasped {{my hands and}} felt the room turning away from me. But it stopped. Mr. Woodcourt came in, put a paper into his hand, and went away again.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> quite gave up hope. I had {{believed}} that I {{was in some}} lonely house, {{in the suburbs of}} the city, and I little thought that my cries could not be heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Secret Service {{people from}} other countries. Lord Wisbeach was telling me about it yesterday. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to suspect everybody. He said that an attempt might be made on Willie's {{invention}} at any moment now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' stammered Betty, 'in {{the course}} of his letters to me <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> belonged to him, and if nobody knew that we met it would make no difference. And that I need not hurt your {{feelings}} by telling you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can a {{sand hole}} remain full of water?' asked he. 'Of course, {{it will all}} run through. The {{crocodile}} called it a [...] "chance"; but {{he might as well}} have dragged me into the river at once. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> truly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot escape him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} refuse pardon thus asked,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> 'Oh, Gilbert, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hope {{this were the}} {{beginning}} of a new course!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nasmyth {{warned me}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was early--or rather <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{were going to}} visit anybody else I {{would have been too}} soon. I'd better confess, however, that I've been making a good use of the time. Things of this kind"--he {{indicated}} the statuettes--"are almost new to me. They strike me as unusually fine." ...|$|R
60|$|To-day <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{shall need}} some little things to {{remember}} {{my father and}} mother by when we are gone. So I am to take my father's gold watch while he is asleep. My hero! How thoughtful he is of my happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> {{burst out}} laughing, a foolish thing to do, mark you, {{for when you}} laugh, you're done for; but I couldn't help it {{for the life of}} me. I'd seen many tramps but never such a cool one as this.|$|E
6000|$|... "No devil, girl, but {{a desire}} for your own good, and," [...] he added with a burst of truth, [...] "for the greatness of my House after I am gone, which will be soon. For your old wizard spoke rightly when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stand near to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I hope you'll help me do it, uncle," [...] said Tom, earnestly. [...] "If {{my father}} shouldn't get well, I {{should be very}} unhappy to think {{anything}} had been done against his will <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hinder. And I'm sure he meant me to remember what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> evening. <b>I</b> ought to obey my father's wish about his property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're ambitious," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{think it}} a fault, when it's {{more or less}} warranted. Your thrown away here, and you know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} as it is, Ghita," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "than <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should live without thee. Fate has been kind in thus ending my misery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{nevertheless}} he did rebuke me. He {{considered that}} I was travelling beyond my own concerns, in wishing to interfere {{for the protection}} of my mother's name. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should leave it to such people as the Staveleys and the Ormes to guard her from ignominy and disgrace." ...|$|E
6000|$|In trading remarks {{concerning}} our ages I {{confessed to}} forty-two and Hay to forty. Then {{he asked if}} I had begun to write my autobiography, and I said I hadn't. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought to begin at once, and that I had already lost two years. Then he said in substance this: ...|$|E
60|$|Cobb. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might come}} to the public {{assemblies}} and hear. What though you do not preach? you may hear. Do not think yourself so well enlightened, {{and that you have}} received a gift so far above others, but that you may hear other men preach. Or to that purpose.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke again, very {{stiff and}} bruised, but much refreshed, night had fallen, for hanging lamps were lit about the room. By their light I saw the chamberlain of whom I have spoken {{standing}} before me. I asked him his errand. With many bows <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> were rested the Inca Upanqui desired my presence {{that he might}} speak with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cold enough. He {{had come}} to the {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was very selfish and unworthy; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> used other people for my own advantage, or let them use themselves; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was treacherous and vindictive, and if I didn't betray a man I couldn't be happy till I had beaten him. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> ever behaved well, it came after I had been successful one way or the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{remain with}} her {{for an hour or}} so," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "After <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall leave her entirely to herself. You'll be here in case there's a change?" ...|$|R
