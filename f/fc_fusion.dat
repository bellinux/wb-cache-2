N-glycosylation {{as one of}} the most complex post-translational modification influences the structural characteristics of the antibodies Fc part thereby potentially modulating effector function and pharmacokinetics. Several investigations on the relationship between N-glycosylation and pharmacokinetics have been published. However, this structure–function relationship is not fully understood.

40|$|Purpose: Axon {{regeneration}} in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) is hindered by the presence of myelin inhibitory molecules. LINGO– 1 is a new member of the myelin receptor complex besides NogoR 1 and p 75. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of LINGO– 1 <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein in the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in a rat glaucoma model. Methods:Experimental glaucoma was induced in the right eye of each animal by elevating the intraocular pressure (IOP), and the left eye was used as control. Laser photocoagulation was applied twice to the episcleral and limbal veins at 7 days interval. LINGO– 1 <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein was injected into the vitreous of the right eye after the first laser application. The loss of RGCs labeled by Fluoro–Gold was determined from flat–mounted retina 14 days later. Results:There was a significant loss of RGCs (13. 2 %) following the induction of elevated IOP in the PBS injection group. There was also a 10. 6 % RGCs loss in the human IgG injection group. A single intravitreal injection of LINGO– 1 <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein showed significant neuroprotective effect in enhancing the survival of RGCs (RGC death of – 0. 3 %). Conclusions: These results provide evidence that LINGO– 1 <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein exerts neuroprotective activity to damaged RGCs in hypertensive eyes. It suggests that modulation of the interaction of myelin inhibitory proteins with their receptors has therapeutic application for CNS injury...|$|E

40|$|Fucose {{removal from}} complex-type {{oligosaccharide}} of human IgGs {{results in a}} major enhancement of Fc-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The {{aim of this study}} was to deter-mine the effect of fucose removal on the effector function of another class of clinically important molecules that can effect cellular cytotoxicity, <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins. The recep-tors chosen for study were TNF receptor II and LFA- 3, both of which have therapeutic significance. The fucosylated versions of these fusion proteins were produced in unmo-dified CHO cells, whereas the nonfucosylated counterparts were produced in CHO cells with a- 1, 6 -fucosyltransferase, an enzyme required for fucosylation, knocked-out. Whilst binding activity of TNFRII-Fc and LFA- 3 -Fc were unchanged by fucose-removal, nonfucosylated <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins exhibited significantly higher Fc receptor cIIIa–binding and increased Fc-mediated cytotoxicity on target cells compared to fuco-sylated counterparts. Notably, in case of TNFRII-Fc, only the nonfucosylated protein exhibited potent Fc dependent cytotoxicity to transmembrane TNF-a expressing cells. These results prove that enhancement of Fc dependent cellular cytotoxicity by fucose-removal is effective in not only whole IgG but also <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins, and thus widens the potential of Fc-fusion proteins as therapeutic candidates...|$|E

40|$|High {{throughput}} screenings {{of single}} chain Fv (scFv) antibody phage display libraries are currently done as soluble scFvs produced in E. coli. Due to endotoxin contaminations from bacterial cells these preparations cannot be reliably used in mammalian cell based assays. The monovalent nature {{and lack of}} Fc in soluble scFvs prevent functional assays that are dependent on target cross linking and/or Fc functions. A convenient approach is to convert scFvs into scFv. <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins and express them in mammalian cell lines for screening. This approach is low throughput and is only taken after primary screening of monovalent scFvs that are expressed in bacteria. There is no platform at present that combines the benefits of both bacterial and mammalian expression system for screening phage library output. We have, therefore, developed a novel dual expression vector, called pSplice, {{which can be used}} to express scFv. <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins both in E. coli and mammalian cell lines. The hallmark of the vector is an engineered intron which houses the bacterial promoter and signal peptide for expression and secretion of scFv. Fc in E. coli. When the vector is transfected into a mammalian cell line, the intron is efficiently spliced out resulting in a functional operon for expression and secretion of the scFv. <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein into the culture medium. By applying basic knowledge of mammalian introns and splisosome, we designed this vector to enable screening of phage libraries in a product like format. Like IgG, the scFv. <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> protein is bi-valent for the antigen and possesses Fc effector functions. Expression in E. coli maintains the speed of the bacterial expression platform and is used to triage clones based on binding and other assays that are not sensitive to endotoxin. Triaged clones are then expressed in a mammalian cell line without the need for any additional cloning steps. Conditioned media from the mammalian cell line containing the fusion proteins are then used for different types of cell based assays. Thus this system retains the speed of the current screening system for phage libraries and adds additional functionality to it...|$|E

30|$|The second area of {{antibody}} targeting that {{is represented}} by clinical candidates {{is based on the}} route of delivery to get the antibodies to the desired compartment.

30|$|Traditional {{forms of}} {{delivery}} for mAbs and <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins has been via either intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration of formulated proteins. Generally, high dose mAbs for oncology indications {{are limited to}} IV dosing, whereas low dose antibodies such as adalimumab, golimumab, and ustekinumab can easily be delivered in SC doses. Additionally, in recent {{years there has been}} increased interest in intratumoral dosing of antibodies and other biologics for certain types of cancer where the tumor is more accessible (Zeltsman et al., 2016). A novel approach for delivering mAbs and/or <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins is via delivery of the gene or genes that produce them, either as naked DNA, RNA, or by a viral-based vector. This is not an entirely new approach, since studies were done {{around the turn of the}} century showing that RNA (Giraud et al., 1999) and viral (Lewis et al., 2002) delivery of IgG genes could result in demonstration of in vivo IgG activity. Nevertheless, there was not much interest until the past few years, when it has become evident that vectored or nucleic acid delivery of IgG could potentially be a significant new approach to deliver antibodies for therapeutic use.|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of FDA-approved therapeutic antibodies are administered intravenously (iv). The iv route allows for rapid delivery of {{large amounts of}} antibodies to the systemic circulation with complete systemic availability. In addition, the iv route allows the administration of larger volumes in comparison to other parenteral routes of administration. However, iv delivery, often required to be conducted in hospitals or doctor’s office, is not convenient for patients, and increases the cost of therapy. In addition, rapid infusion of antibody may also induce adverse events such as infusion reactions. Therefore, for some mAbs requiring chronic dosing, extravascular routes such as subcutaneous (sc) and intra-muscular (im) administration have been developed. Sc or im administration can be performed by a health care professional in a patient’s home or even by self-administration (Richter & Jacobsen, 2014). Examples for extravascular administration of mAbs or <b>Fc</b> <b>fusions</b> are adalimumab (sc), alefacept (im), efalizumab (sc), etanercept (sc), omalizumab (sc), and palivizumab (im).|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{vaccines}} such as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, {{are gradually}} {{giving way to}} more biochemically defined vaccines that are most often based on a recombinant antigen known to possess neutralizing epitopes. Such vaccines can offer improvements in speed, safety and manufacturing process but an inevitable consequence of their high degree of purification is that immunogenicity is reduced through the lack of the innate triggering molecules present in more complex preparations. Targeting recombinant vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells however can improve immunogenicity by ensuring that antigen processing is as efficient as possible. Immune complexes, {{one of a number}} of routes of APC targeting, are mimicked by a recombinant approach, crystallizable fragment (<b>Fc)</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins, in which the target immunogen is linked directly to an antibody effector domain capable of interaction with receptors, FcR, on the APC cell surface. A number of virus <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins have been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and shown to be efficiently produced and purified.

30|$|Fc fusions are fusions of the IgG Fc domain {{with either}} a protein or peptide. In theory, the fusion can be to either the C- or N-terminus of the Fc, but most Fc fusions {{on the market and}} in {{clinical}} development today are N-terminal fusions. The primary reason for generating Fc fusions is to extend the half-life of pharmacologically relevant protein or peptide by using the FcRn-mediated recycling of the Fc (Strohl and Strohl, 2012; Strohl, 2015). Currently, 11 <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins have been approved for therapeutic use (Table  1), three are in phase III clinical trials, and 23 are being evaluated in earlier stage clinical trials (Table  3). Many of the earlier Fc fusions generally were constructed using receptor exodomains in immune pathways (e.g., TNFRSF 18 [p 75], CD 58 [LFA 3], CTLA 4, IL 1 R 1 [IL- 1 receptor]) fused to the Fc to modulate the immune system, either by blocking soluble cytokines or by binding to cells. More recent <b>Fc</b> <b>fusion</b> proteins have become more diverse (Strohl, 2015), with the pharmacologically active “head groups” being blood factors, such as F 9 (Factor IX) and F 8 (Factor VIII), peptides such as GCG (GLP- 1) and a THPO (thrombopoietin) analogue, and an enzyme, such as the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP; Millan et al., 2008) in asfotase alfa (Strensiq®) (Hofman et al., 2016).|$|E

We expressed the extracellular domain of the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) GP fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG 1 (ZEBOVGP-Fc) in mammalian cells and showed that GP undergoes the complex furin cleavage and processing observed in the native membrane-bound GP. Mice immunized with ZEBOVGP-Fc developed T-cell immunity against ZEBOV GP and neutralizing antibodies against replication-competent VSV-G deleted recombinant VSV containing ZEBOV GP. The ZEBOVGP-Fc vaccinated mice were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of ZEBOV. These results show that vaccination with the ZEBOVGP-Fc fusion protein alone without the need of a viral vector or assembly into virus-like particles is sufficient to induce protective immunity against ZEBOV in mice.
