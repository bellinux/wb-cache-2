40|$|It {{is a major}} {{clinical}} and public health problem {{that there is no}} clear strategy as to how we best make use of information obtained when pregnant women take drugs. For this reason, some pregnant women are not treated as they should be and some are given drugs they should not use. We suggest a monitoring system that combines some of the available datasets in Europe. Using these sources as a starting point, one can develop a system that has sufficient power to detect even rare diseases like congenital malformations and sufficient diversity to detect several possible outcomes from spontaneous abortions to childhood disorders. We also suggest that case-crossover designs should be used in case-control monitoring systems that carry a high risk of recall bias. These considerations are based upon our results from a <b>European</b> Union-funded <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> called EuroMaP (Medicine and Pregnancy) ...|$|R

Basing statistics on the number of foreigners in a country is problematical as numbers are affected by variations in definitions and policies concerning immigration. Categorizing by ethnic origin raises serious definitional problems. For the numerator, epidemiology must be based on AIDS case data since systematic HIV testing of migrants is excluded on both practical and human rights grounds, but there are reasons for both over- and under-reporting of AIDS in migrant groups. Underlying issues of stigmatization and of racism are discussed. While there Is need for improvement in the epidemiological data collected, both planning and evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention programmes should more reasonably be based on proxy indicators, essentially those of knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, as well as on good ethnographie...|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} method for estimating the prevalence rates of chronic diseases that are treated by specific drugs was proposed in 1988 to European {{countries in the}} framework of a <b>European</b> Community <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> on diabetes epidemiology. Data on consumption of antidiabetic drugs were collected at the national level in nine countries and at a regional level in two. Using official drug sales data and recent demographic data, we estimated the diabetes prevalence rates in each country or region. The estimated diabetes prevalence in Europe varied from 1. 6 % in Northern Ireland to 4. 7 % in Malta. In four countries that already had diabetes prevalence data, the estimation through drug consumption provided figures 3 - 20 % lower than those from field surveys. This study showed a large variety of prescribing habits for diabetic patients in Europe (for example, the proportion of insulin-treated patients varies from 13 % to 36 %) and underscores the need for a consensus on antidiabetic treatments based on valid clinical research. The proposed approach does not replace field surveys but provides an inexpensive and practical marker of disease frequency and therapeutic attitudes over space and time...|$|R

40|$|The {{papers in}} this special issue present results of the <b>European</b> Union (EU) <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> ¿Experiences {{with the impact of}} subsoil {{compaction}} on soil crop growth and environment and ways to prevent subsoil compaction¿. The results and conclusions of earlier research on subsoil compaction are memorized and it is emphasized that the conclusions are still sound: high axle load traffic on soils of high moisture content causes deep and persistent subsoil compaction. The <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> on subsoil compaction in the EU and an almost identical <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> on subsoil compaction in central and eastern Europe are briefly introduced. This special issue presents a selection of papers of the concluding workshop of the <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> on subsoil compaction in the EU. It includes three papers on modeling the impact of subsoil compaction on crop growth, water availability to plants and environmental aspects; three papers on modeling of subsoil compaction by heavy machinery; four papers on measurement of soil mechanical and physical properties in relation to subsoil compaction and four papers on methods to determine the risk of subsoil compaction and to identify prevention strategies. The trends in agriculture in relation to subsoil compaction are discussed. A positive trend is that policy makers in the EU and worldwide recognize soil as a vital and largely non-renewable resource increasingly under pressure. A negative trend is that wheel loads in agriculture are still increasing causing severe damage to subsoils. The conclusion is that European subsoils are more threatened than ever in history. Manufactures, agricultural engineers and soil scientists should collaborate and research should be initiated to solve this problem and find solutions. Subsoil compaction should be made recognized by all people involved from farmer to policy maker. Therefore an assessment of the existence and seriousness of subsoil compaction throughout Europe should be initiated...|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} has {{investigated}} the external dimension of European Union's (EU) counter-terrorism {{in much more}} detail than ever before. EU's counter-terrorism policy has been criticized on various grounds, ranging from questioning its efficiency, to coherence and implementation.

Following the 11 March 2004 attacks on Madrid, which killed almost 200 people, the EU underlined the importance of deepening the international consensus to combat terrorism, which made it an increasing actor in global counter-terrorism efforts.

The question of reproducibility, reliability, and comparability {{of the results}} of such experiments has never been addressed on a large scale. Recently, 12 European PET centers performed the same cognitive activation experiment in a <b>European</b> Union funded <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> The experiment involved a standardized and validated cross-lingual experimental and control task involving verbal fluency. Each center contributed at least 6 subjects. In total there were 77 subjects and 247 scans in each of the two conditions, giving 494 scans in total. We have analyzed each center's dataset and pooled datasets using statistical parametric mapping. We present results that address the consistency of these analyses, discuss the factors that influence their sensitivity, and comment on a number of related methodological issues. We used a MANOVA to test for center, condition, and centre by condition effects and found a strong condition and center effect and weaker interactions. The main effect determining reproducibility was the overall sensitivity of the experiment, to which the scanner and number of scans contribute in a major way, with a marked advantage for 3 D scanners and a large field of view. An important conclusion is that data from different centers can be pooled to improve the reliability of results, which is of particular importance for studies in patients with rare conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the Netherlands an 18 months {{case control study}} into cot {{death was}} under-taken {{as part of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Concerted</b> <b>Action</b> (ECAS) on sudden infant death {{syndrome}} to determine the relative risk of prone sleeping and other sleep practices. Physicians in the Netherlands were asked to report to the study centre all sudden and unexpected deaths of children between 1 week and 2 years of age. Non cot death cases were deleted from further analysis after a consensus was reached by three pathologists, not primarily involved in the post mortem diagnosis. A positive response of families was achieved in 91 % of cases registered in the Central Bureau of Statistics. The study com-prised 73 cot deaths and 146 controls, two for each case and matched for date of birth. All families were visited at home for completion of a questionnaire. The cot death rate has dropped considerably over the past 10 years after the recommendations on supine sleeping to a low of 0. 26 per 1000 live born infants. In addition to the ECAS objective, we wanted to establish whether previously found risk factors are still valid in the present situation or that new factors might have emerged, some of them possibly protective. Conclusion Placing an infant prone or on side on last occasion, secondary prone position (not placed prone but turned to prone), inexperienced prone sleeping and use of a duvet, leading to head and body being covered, were shown to be risk factors. Preventive factors were using a cotton sleeping-sack and a dummy. Even in a low incidence country, such as the Netherlands, there are indications that further prevention is possible.

40|$|In this article, I {{offer an}} {{approach}} to <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> that builds on traditional Chicago School analyses of the issue, but adds {{a focus on the}} role of communication. Chicago scholars uniformly identify cartels as the primary target of antitrust enforcement. They have also established much of the framework within which courts and economists analyze <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> George Stigler’s seminal theory of oligopoly, which sought to identify the determinants of effective collusion, has spawned an enormous literature in game theory that models the pricing behavior of oligopolists. Richard Posner’s early analysis of tacit collusion - rivals’ coordination of noncompetitive pricing without express communication - extended Stigler’s analysis to the domain of law and policy. His approach to oligopoly pricing drew on economic theory and evidence both to define tacit collusion as <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> and to identify structural and behavioral characteristics of markets that suggested its presence. I argue that Posner’s approach, refocused on the role of communication, provides the most promising way forward in the analysis of <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> After recounting the history of the Chicago School’s analysis of <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> I propose a modified definition of <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> and suggest how the change might affect the search for instances of <b>concerted</b> <b>action.</b> I argue that Section 1 does not reach tacit collusion, but neither does it require a verbal agreement; instead, <b>actions</b> are <b>concerted</b> if rivals coordinate them in part by communicating their intentions. I argue that this focus on communicative <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> despite its departure from Posner’s legal position, is consistent with the Chicago tradition, particularly error cost analysis. Its neo-Chicago character lies in its reliance on the most recent economic literature on the role of communication in collusion. In {{the last part of the}} article, I examine a small but important subset of that literature: studies of how real-world cartels use communication and facilitating practices to achieve their aims. Based on these studies, I suggest how plaintiffs and enforcement agencies might discover <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> by examining changing patterns in the use of facilitating practices...|$|R
