5|$|General Motors <b>is</b> <b>sponsoring</b> the Pecan Street {{demonstration}} project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

2500|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <b>is</b> <b>sponsoring</b> a multi-year {{study of}} {{value-added}} modeling with their Measures of Effective Teaching program. [...] Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as {{control of the}} classroom and challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify effective teachers. [...] The study about student evaluations was done by Ronald Ferguson. [...] The study also discovered that teachers who teach to the test are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum. Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however. Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report do not support the conclusions, and that [...] "interpreted correctly... undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.” [...] More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.|$|E
