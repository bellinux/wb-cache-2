25|$|In 1922 Mowinckel staged an {{adaptation}} of Wedekind's play Spring Awakening at Intimteatret. The performance was well received by the public, with standing ovations. This {{was the first time}} Munch's paintings were used at a Norwegian stage. In a retrospective article from 1939 Anton Rønneberg characterized this event as an important day in the history of Norwegian theatre. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> her artistic eye for the stage setting, and for the harmony between stage decorations, costumes, light and choreography.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only one}} window in McEwen's car was open, {{and none of}} them had been shattered, Seedman knew the shot had to have been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the {{distance}} and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter—a local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle.|$|E
25|$|In 217, Cao Cao {{launched}} {{another attack}} on Sun Quan, {{leading to the}} Battle of Ruxu. Zhou Tai participated in the defence of Ruxu, and Sun Quan's forces succeeded in driving back the invaders. After Cao Cao's retreat, Zhou Tai was appointed General Who Pacifies the Caitiffs (平虜將軍) and was ordered to remain behind to guard Ruxu. At the time, Zhu Ran and Xu Sheng were also stationed at Ruxu and were Zhou Tai's subordinates, but they were reluctant to submit to Zhou's command. Sun Quan made a special trip to Ruxu and he threw a party for all the military officers there. Sun Quan personally served wine to Zhou Tai {{and asked him to}} undress. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> every scar on Zhou Tai's body and asked Zhou about it, whereupon Zhou would relate stories of the battles he fought in. At the end, Sun Quan told Zhou Tai to put on his clothes and they revelled through the night. The following day, Sun Quan instructed a herald to grant Zhou Tai his imperial parasol.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Ivaylo was {{received}} well by Nogai Khan. When {{news of his}} whereabouts reached Constantinople, Michael VIII sent Ivan Asen III with rich gifts to the Mongol court to ask assistance. Nogai Khan expressed interest in the issue and for several months kept promising help to both pretenders. Eventually the Byzantine influence prevailed because the Mongol leader was married to the illegitimate daughter of Michael VIII, Euphrosyne Palaiologina. During a feast, in which Ivaylo and Ivan Asen III seated {{on both sides of}} Nogai Khan, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> Ivaylo with the words [...] "He is an enemy of my father, the Emperor , and does not deserve to live" [...] and ordered his execution. Ivaylo, along with Kasim beg, were duly murdered on the spot. Ivan Asen III was fortunate to avoid similar fate due to the advocacy of Euphrosyne and eventually returned to his estates in Asia Minor, where he died in 1303.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the time}} limit, U2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace. They {{continued}} their long-time practice of jamming in the studio. Eno and Flood edited together song sections they liked and then discussed the arrangements with the group. U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed; <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> chords and various commands, such as [...] "hold", [...] "stop", [...] "change", and [...] "change back", to direct their performances. To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The production crew faced issues with audio spill at The Factory, as all group members recorded {{in the same room}} as the mixing desk and Bono frequently sang in-progress lyrics that would need to be replaced. Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers' sounds as much as possible.|$|E
2500|$|At Indianapolis {{later in}} summer 2002, Busch was racing {{in the top}} ten. He aggressively passed Spencer on lap 37. In reply Spencer {{deliberately}} tapped Busch who then crashed into the turn 3 wall. Busch climbed out of his demolished car and until paramedics came, whenever he saw Spencer driving by him under caution, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> Spencer and repeatedly shouted at him. When interviewed Kurt called Jimmy Spencer a [...] "decrepit old has-been or maybe I should say a never-was." [...] Spencer replied [...] "Kurt {{has a lot to}} learn, and some of that is to control his mouth".|$|E

5000|$|As many of Bradbury's stories, [...] "Marionettes, Inc." [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a warning to society. Bradbury comments on the rise of technology as a way to solve marital conflicts. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> the probable dangers of dehumanized, machine-driven world where artificial intelligence, AI, slowly substitutes for man and eliminates its makers.|$|R

2500|$|In spring 643, Wei was gravely ill. [...] Emperor Taizong sent {{numerous}} messengers {{to attend}} to Wei's illness, and further had the official Li Anyan (李安儼) stay at Wei's mansion to oversee Wei's care. [...] He also personally visited Wei, with Li Chengqian, and <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> his daughter Princess Hengshan and promised to give her to Wei's son Wei Shuyu in marriage. [...] Wei died soon thereafter, and Emperor Taizong buried Wei with great honors and luxurious funeral supplies, although Wei's wife Lady Pei, pointing out that Wei was himself frugal in living, declined most of the luxuries. [...] Wei was buried near the tomb of Empress Zhangsun (who died in 636), where Emperor Taizong would eventually himself be buried. [...] He also commissioned a stone monument for Wei, and personally wrote {{the text of the}} monument. [...] He missed Wei greatly and stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 196, when Zhou Yu was {{nominally}} {{serving as}} the Chief (長) of Juchao County under the warlord Yuan Shu, he planned to leave Yuan and travel east to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region to join Sun Ce, who had recently conquered some territories in Jiangdong {{over the past few}} years. Along his journey, Zhou Yu brought his militia, numbering a few hundred men, to visit Lu Su and request for supplies. At the time, Lu Su owned two large granaries, each capable of storing 3,000 hu (斛) of grain. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> one granary and gave it to Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu realised that Lu Su was an extraordinary person, so he befriended him. Their friendship was likened to that of Gongsun Qiao and Ji Zha (季札) in the Spring and Autumn period. The Chinese idiom [...] "pointing at a granary and presenting it" [...] (...) , which means to provide generous aid to a person, originated from this incident.|$|E
2500|$|Ling Tong's {{two sons}} – Ling Lie (凌烈) and Ling Feng (凌封) – were both very young when their father died. Sun Quan {{brought them to}} his palace and treated them {{as though they were}} his sons. When guests came to visit him, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> Ling Tong's sons and said, [...] "They are my tiger boys." [...] When Ling Tong's sons reached the age of seven or eight, Sun Quan ordered Ge Guang (葛光) to teach them to read and write, and train them in horse-riding every ten days. When Ling Lie became older, in {{recognition}} of his father's meritorious service, Sun Quan granted him the title of a village marquis (亭侯) and placed him in charge of the unit which used to be commanded by his father. Ling Lie lost his marquis title later and was discharged from service because he committed an offence; the title and military post were passed on to Ling Feng.|$|E

50|$|While doing {{handicraft}} at the daycare centre, Ludo sews {{a stuffed}} rabbit without ears. As Anna criticises him for it, <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> {{the fact that}} another rabbit made by the child Cheyenne-Blue has no ears as well. Anna thereupon claims {{that it is a}} Keinohrhase, a no-ears rabbit, which is able to hear through its nose. This scene was also used for the first teaser trailer.|$|R
2500|$|In 208, Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, {{died and}} was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong. Later that year, when the warlord Cao Cao invaded Jing Province, Liu Cong {{surrendered}} {{and much of}} northern Jing Province came under Cao Cao's control. Liu Bei led his forces {{and a large number}} of civilians south to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which was independent of Cao Cao's control and where Liu Biao's elder son, Liu Qi, was based. Xu Shu accompanied Liu Bei on his journey towards Xiakou. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei. They caught up with him and defeated him at the Battle of Changban. Cao Cao's men captured Xu Shu's mother during the battle, so Xu Shu decided to leave Liu Bei to reunite with his mother. Before leaving, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> his heart and told Liu Bei, [...] "I wanted to join you, General, in making great achievements. This is my purpose in life. Now that I've lost my mother, I've also lost my sense of direction. This isn't going to be helpful. Now I bid farewell to you." [...] He went to join Cao Cao. Shi Tao also followed him and both of them came to serve Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|On January 16, 2009, {{the league}} fined Cuban $25,000 for yelling at Denver Nuggets player J. R. Smith {{at the end}} of the first half on a Mavericks-at-Nuggets game played on January 13. Cuban was {{apparently}} incensed that Smith had thrown an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward Antoine Wright. Cuban offered to match the fine with a donation to a charity of Smith's choosing. Cuban stated that if he doesn't hear from Smith then he will donate the money to the NHL Players' Association Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore. In May 2009, Cuban made a reference to the Denver Nuggets being [...] "thugs" [...] after a loss to the Nuggets in game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The statement was geared towards the Nuggets and their fans. As he passed Kenyon Martin's mother, who was seated near Cuban as he left the arena, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> her and said, [...] "that includes your son". This controversial comment revisited media attention on Cuban yet again. Cuban issued an apology the next day referencing the poor treatment of away fans in arenas around the league. The league issued a statement stating that they would not fine him.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the movie, von Dietrich muses that he {{has finally}} {{realised}} why he never managed to defeat his nemesis Walter; standing on a hill <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> Sarajevo below and remarks in German: Sehen Sie diese Stadt? Das ist Walter! ("You see that city? That's Walter!") This was intended to send a message of unity consistent with the official politics of the multi-ethnic state of Yugoslavia.|$|R

40|$|Charles Taylor {{has made}} a {{remarkable}} attempt to recover the moral ideal of authenticity {{as opposed to the}} debased form of authenticity, that leads to individualism. <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> the dialogical nature of authenticity, and finally, in another work, justifies the need for recognition. I want to show that the middle part of this chain of argument, dialogicality, if properly understood, cannot lead us to recognition in the sense Taylor ascribes to the latter...|$|R
