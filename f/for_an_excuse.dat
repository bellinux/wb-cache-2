25|$|Thiers {{arrived at}} Versailles on 31 October and {{negotiations}} began {{the next day}} (1 November). Thiers initially asked for a 28-day armistice with provisioning of Paris and all besieged cities. Bismarck refused and countered by asking {{for one of the}} Parisian forts to balance the military advantages France would accrue from a ceasefire. Thiers rejected the surrender of any fortress. He later claimed that Bismarck had been amenable to French demands until news of the popular uprising in Paris had reached him. This uprising—accompanied by shouts of Pas d'armistice! (No armistice!)—had been a response to rumours of Thiers's negotiations. According to Thiers it caused Bismarck to increase his demands, but Lord Lyons believed that the chancellor was merely looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to break off talks.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 1948, {{the line}} was nationalised along with its parent company, {{becoming}} part of British Railways (BR). While the GWR had tolerated the Corris, BR was looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to close the loss making railway. In August 1948, that excuse came when the Afon Dyfi flooded. The waters began to undermine the Corris Railway embankment {{on the south side}} of the Dyfi Bridge, and although the track was never breached, it was the excuse that BR needed to close the line. The last train ran on 20 August 1948 and the following day the railway was closed, without notice. The Aberllefenni to Corris section was lifted in November 1948, and 10 tons of the rail was purchased by Henry Haydn Jones for use on his Talyllyn Railway. By the end of 1950, track lifting had reached Machynlleth station.|$|E
25|$|Born on 18 January 1770 at Obernai in the French {{province}} of Alsace, Beker was {{serving as a}} dragoon in the royal army {{at the beginning of}} the French Revolution. During the War of the First Coalition he earned rapid promotion to adjutant general. After fighting as a dragoon, chasseur, and hussar, he commanded a brigade in 1795 and served as chief of staff in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. He served in the Rhine Campaign of 1796. As a staff officer he was present at an unusual event during the Battle of Limburg. On the night of 16 September 1796 he notified the commander of the right flank division, Jean Castelbert de Castelverd that the Austrians had won a crossing of the Lahn River at Diez but that French forces had sealed off the bridgehead. At this, the division commander panicked and ordered an immediate retreat despite positive orders to hold the river line. This opened a gaping hole in the French lines and led to a general retreat. When later asked privately about his actions, Castelverd fumed that the rest of the army was looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to withdraw. Castelverd was later removed from command for his failure.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

Moore and Hale had 10 children, but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman, with Hale warning his children that [...] "an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain, though she bring a great portion". Moore died in 1658, and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop, his housekeeper. Descriptions of Bishop differ; Roger North wrote that [...] " [...] was unfortunate in his family; for he married his own servant made, and then, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>excuse,</b> {{said there was no}} wisdom below the girdle". Richard Baxter, on the other hand, described Anne as [...] "one of [...] own judgment and temper, prudent and loving, and fit to please him; and that would not draw on him the trouble of much acquaintance and relations".

It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing.

Some turnpike protesters removed their names from the customer list at Mazzio's Italian Eatery on June 23. On June 24, about forty protesters picketed the Bank of Oklahoma, and around six closed their accounts. The chief executives of both businesses were {{on the board of the}} Chamber of Commerce. In response to the boycott, Mayor Randle issued a statement accusing Tulsans Against Turnpikes of [...] "seeking to wage economic coercion against businesses" [...] and described their tactics as [...] " [...] as a kind of economic blackmail to silence debate", as well as [...] "allowing differences of opinion to degenerate into intimidation against those who have taken public stands unpopular with [...] ". Randle also canceled a planned meeting with the group, refusing to meet with them until they ceased the boycott. A Tulsans Against Turnpikes board member publicly replied to the mayor's statement by denying that a boycott was taking place, stating that the group only recommended that members not do business with Mazzio's and Bank of Oklahoma because of their support for the Creek Turnpike project via their activity with the Chamber of Commerce.

Although the information about the contest between Artabanus and Vologases is trace, the Latin sources say that Caracalla gave special attention to the internal contest of Parthians and reported the disruption of the Parthians' status to the Roman Senate. Knowledge about the civil war in the Parthian Empire might have encouraged [...] "the idea of a military conquest" [...] in Caracalla and stimulated him towards successes larger than those of his father's (Septimius Severus) in fighting the Parthians.
