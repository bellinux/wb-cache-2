500|$|According to Branco, the show's past writing {{teams had}} {{proposed}} creating a Marty and Todd love story, {{but it never}} happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He later issued an apology for the comment: [...] "I should <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1918, LDS {{president}} Joseph F.

In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped up again and again for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 2014, in North Korea {{prior to}} the {{exhibition}} games, Rodman made comments during a CNN interview implying that Kenneth Bae was at fault for his imprisonment. The remarks were widely reported in other media outlets and provoked a storm of criticism. Two days later, Rodman apologized for his comments, {{saying that he had}} been drinking and under pressure. He added that he [...] "should <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> make political statements". Some members of the U.S. Congress, the NBA and human rights groups suggested that Rodman had become a public relations stunt for the North Korean government. On May 2, 2016, Kenneth Bae credited Rodman with his early release. He said that Rodman's rant raised awareness of his case and that he wanted to personally thank him for his expedited release.|$|E

2500|$|St. John {{felt the}} need to {{apologize}} following comments he made at an August 2008 Fan Club Luncheon. When asked about the controversial storyline, he replied, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He issued the following apology to SOAPnet.com: [...] "I regret the way I responded to the question about the upcoming Todd and Marty storyline. It was meant in jest and I should <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nuttall and Barba theorized {{from their}} own {{experience}} about how an LAPD officer would commit a murder. It {{would be better to}} do it on a day off, and departmental records showed that Lazarus had indeed been off the day Sherri Rasmussen was killed. An officer would <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> use his or her duty gun, since {{it would have to be}} disposed of after the crime and the penalties for losing a duty gun or failing to prevent its theft were severe. Instead it made sense to use a backup gun like Lazarus' [...]38. Lastly, a working patrol officer would know how to do just enough to make the crime scene look like an interrupted burglary to satisfy an overworked detective.|$|E

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I <b>know</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do.
