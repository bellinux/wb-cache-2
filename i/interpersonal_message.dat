Findings from this study will provide health education professionals with valuable information on body image from a cultural perspective. The Young Women’s Experiences with Body Weight and Shape Questionnaire (49 questions; containing five factors of weight dissatisfaction, slimness as quality of life, <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages</b> regarding slimness, rejecting the value of thinness, and valuing exercise) were used and general demographics were collected. A One-Way ANOVA was used to test differences between the HBCU and PWC as well as for comparing differences between the three sub-groups (African American HBCU, African American PWC, and Euro American PWC). Significant differences were found with all five factors between HBCU and PWC: weight dissatisfaction (p<. 001), slimness as quality of life (p<. 001), <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages</b> regarding slimness (p<. 001), rejecting the value of thinness (p=. 001) and valuing exercise (p=. 023).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary {{results of the}} pilot study conducted at the University of the Sunshine Coast, which investigated the memorable messages, that first year education students reported that they receive. The investigation looked at the questions “What are the memorable messages received by first year students?” and “How are these memorable messages impacting the first year students’ engagement and learning?” Memorable messages are defined as ‘‘verbal messages which may be remembered for extremely {{long periods of time}} and which people perceive as a major influence on the course of their lives’’ (Knapp, Stohl & Reardon 1981, p. 27). Memorable messages involve brief prescriptive oral commands (Knapp et al., 1981) that often come from an authority figure (Ellis & Smith, 2004). “Some <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages</b> are reported to be remembered {{for a long time and}} to have a profound influence on a person’s life” (Knapp et. al., 1981 p 27). Communication and non-communication will intentionally and unintentionally create memorable messages. These memorable messages being received by the students impact on their decision to continue with their program at USC, to transfer or leave university. Attrition rates for new students are high and this pilot project aimed to discover if any memorable messages were contributing to this factor. The role of universities is changing from simply educating students, to preparing them for work and professional roles (Cranmer, 2006; Dochy et al, 1999; Barr & Tagg, 1995). Higgen, Hartley & Skelton (2002) discuss the idea that students should now be seen as consumers of University services rather than just students gaining information. This combined with the high level of consumer communication indicates the question ‘are the memorable messages the staff wish to provide actually being received by the students?’ is an essential area in need of investigation. USC’s approach to student retention is based on Tinto & Pusser’s (2006) five overarching conditions (pillars/principles) that Universities can provide that contribute to student success. The five pillars are: 1. Commitment 2. Expectations 3. Support 4. Feedback 5. Involvement A mixed method approach was adopted to gather both quantitative and qualitative data. This approach focused on the memorable messages received by the students; the impact of these messages; and the implication of these messages on engagement and retention of first year students. The messages were discovered through the mixed method of survey and focus groups.

The study is descriptive in nature and examines types, causes, and patterns/principles of various linguistic adaptations made in text messages. It also provides historical insights, and discusses linguistic-cum-educational impacts and implications of these adaptations. Primarily, the study {{is based on the}} linguistic analysis of an SMS corpus of 5000 <b>interpersonal</b> text <b>messages</b> collected from Pakistani texters. For triangulation purposes, it also examines the metalinguistic perceptions of 500 texters who also provided their personal text messages for the study. The study explores linguistic adaptations in six major categories, i. e. lexical, syntactic, punctuation, space, code, and script adaptations in text messages. It was found in the study that linguistic adaptations in text messages are mostly made under certain principles/patterns. Most intentional adaptations in text messages are caused by three major factors that are to be economical in the use of time and effort, to be creative/innovative in developing new language patterns, and to be rapid in SMS communication. Some unintentional adaptations are caused by the careless attitude or poor language command of texters. In addition, many punctuation adaptations are specifically made for paralinguistic purposes. Code alterations are made in the bilingual settings of texters. Lastly, the Roman script is preferred because most Pakistani texters are not adept in typing the Arabic/Urdu script, and so they use the Roman script for both Urdu and English. In the historical perspective, these adaptations are not completely new in nature because their traces are found in history or in other modes of communication. Moreover, these adaptations have various linguistic/educational impacts, and these impacts lead to certain implications for the conventional standards of languages and their teaching...|$|R

This study meets recent calls to bridge policy makers and academics, and calls for more thorough analysis of operational work in terms of behavioral determinants, to move the fields on. It takes a key operational element of a recently reported successful food waste sorting program—manning of the new bins by volunteers—and considers the behavioral determinants involved in order to design a more scalable and cheaper alternative—the use of brightly colored covers with flower designs on three sides of the bin. The two interventions were tested in a medium-scale, real-life experimental set-up that showed that they had statistically similar results: high effective capture rates of 32 %– 34 %, with low contamination rates. The success, low cost and simple implementation of the latter suggests it should be considered for large-scale use.

40|$|In {{the past}} several decades there has been a {{proliferation}} of interest and development of family systems theories. A unique aspect of a systems perspective is that human problems develop in and because of social interactions usually within the family, rather than solely from some internal process within an individual. A second innovation is the view that human behavior always occurs in a context, and that understanding the context is essential for understanding problem development and resolution. The empirical evaluation and validation of these perspectives has lagged behind theoretical and therapeutic developments. Further, research in this area has been hampered by a lack of reliable and valid measures of constructs of interest. During the 1980 s there were significant developments concerning measurement issues and instrument development that facilitate the assessment of family relationships. This chapter will review and discuss issues and methods for assessing family health and distress. THEORETICAL AND PRAGMATIC ISSUES IN ASSESSING FAMILY HEALTH AND DISTRESS What is a Healthy Family? There are as many definitions of healthy and dysfunctional families as there are theories of family functioning and family relationships (Gurman 2 ̆ 6 Kniskern, 1981; Walsh, 1982). Although many of these theories overlap in their perspectives, there are unique aspects that are important to consider in describing healthy family processes. A complete review of theories of healthy families {{is beyond the scope of}} this chapter. However, a brief discussion of common aspects of systems approaches to families and family health is provided to orient the reader to basic assumptions of this approach. A systems perspective to families views each family member as part of an interdependent interactional system that mutually influences other aspects of the family system. Change within one aspect of the system is believed to produce change in other parts of the family through a process of reciprocal feedback and shared meanings between family members. This is referred to as circular causality because the focus is on patterns of interactions rather than linear explanations of causality. The nonsummativity principle views the entire family as greater than the sum of the parts. It is essential to examine the pattern of relationships rather than just the pieces. Thus, assessing components or subsystems of the family system will not provide a picture of the whole family. All behavior within the family is considered communication that transmits <b>interpersonal</b> <b>messages.</b> Communication includes both the content of the messages and the process or how the messages are transmitted (Watzlawick, Beavin, 2 ̆ 6 Jackson, 1967). Homeostasis refers to the mechanism by which the family maintains a steady state and equilibrium. Homeostasis is maintained through deviation-reducing feedback loops within the family, similar to how a thermostat regulates the temperature within a room. Morphogenesis is the process by which families change and adapt to internal and external demands. Positive feedback loops within the family that are deviation amplifying contribute to system change. Equifinality refers to the belief that systems may start at the same beginning, but may end with different outcomes because of system organization and response to the social and environmental context. Multifinality is the same principle in reverse; families can start with divergent beginnings and end with the same outcomes. Some systems approaches to families also view family functioning in a multigenerational perspective, with at least three generations considered (Bowen, 1978; Boszormenyi-Nagy 2 ̆ 6 Ulrich, 1981; Kerr, 1981; Williamson 2 ̆ 6 Bray, 1988). Learned patterns of relating, attitudes, unresolved emotional issues, and loyalties are presumed to be passed down through the generations and directly affect current family functioning. Healthy families promote the well-being and functioning of each individual family member through the maintenance of clear and effective communication, mutually beneficial interactional patterns, clear boundaries between the generations and between family subsystems, and expectations that change over time to the internal demands of family members and external demands of the environment. A balance is maintained between the needs for family stability and change that promotes the health of individual family members. All families have problems as they go through transitions across the life cycle, and dysfunctional families have an inability to make these transitions without experiencing problems (Watzlawick, Weakland, 2 ̆ 6 Fisch, 1974). 2 ̆ 2 An ordinary family; that is, the couple has many problems of relating to one another, bringing up children, dealing with in -laws, and coping with the outside world. Like all normal families, they are constantly struggling with these problems and negotiating the compromises that make a life in common possible 2 ̆ 2 (Minuchin, 1974, p. 6) ...|$|R

From theory to practice - implementation of theoretical notions to translation practice [...] 7. Implications for translation practice [...] 8. Concluding remarks. The aim of this research is to investigate the linguistic choices made in translated texts. The investigation is conducted through the examination of a sample of more than 40 translated texts and their originals, selected from an archive of some two hundred pairs of texts, which are used as referential resources to illustrate the most common issues found in English into Vietnamese translation. The texts range across many areas of government services from resettlement issues, to housing, education and common health issues, with a particular focus on mental health. The research has been inspired by several underlining questions concerning the relationship between translation theory and practice and linguistic theory, as well as the possible applicability of linguistic notions and methodologies to further the understanding and seeking solutions for many translation problems. It explores various linguistic notions in explaining and describing the most common issues in translation. It then goes on to examine different analytical tools in text analysis for translation purposes such as register analysis, discourse analysis, metafunction analysis, and genre analysis. Eventually it rests with the textual metafunction analysis, the notion proposed by Halliday (1967, 1985, 1994), which is the language component responsible for organizing and constructing the two other language components; i. e. ideational and <b>interpersonal,</b> into a <b>message.</b> Or, as described by Halliday and Matthiessen (1999 : 512), the most important function of the textual component is that it creates information “[and] engenders discourse, the patterned forms of wording that constitute meaningful semiotic contexts. ”The textual metafunction consists of two interrelated systems, the thematic and information systems, which {{play a crucial role in}} the creation of discourse in a communicative event. The research, however, has a particular interest in investigating the impact caused by the transfer of the thematic structure of the source language text (ST) into that of the target language (TT). In order to achieve the above aim certain theoretical notions such as Theme and Rheme, as well as thematic structure, are discussed in the light of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL); and the linguistic resources used to realize Theme in both languages are looked into. With respect to translation, a detailed discussion regarding the relationship between a particular choice of Theme and the intended meaning of the text covers both Chapter IV and Chapter V of the study. The research also examines how meanings made through the thematic choices in the original texts are interpreted and reproduced by the translator, and the effect of this upon the translations.
