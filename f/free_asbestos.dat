40|$|In {{guinea-pig}} pleural granulomas {{produced by}} the injection of chrysotile asbestos dust, the initial cellular lesions were replaced by old acellular fibrous tissue within 15 - 18 months. After this period calcification of the fibrous tissue commonly occurred. The first sign of calcification was always the formation among the collagen fibres {{of large numbers of}} spherical lamellated bodies. These structures stained positive for acid mucopolysaccharides, and electron-microscope observations showed that they were formed around a core of asbestos dust. Calcium in the form of apatite crystals was also often present in these structures. Shortly after the formation of lamellar bodies the mucopolysaccharide normally present on the collagen fibres, was removed and instead it formed a thick coating around any <b>free</b> <b>asbestos</b> dust in the fibrous area. The first signs of general calcium deposition were seen both in contact with collagen fibres and {{on the surface of the}} coated asbestos dust.

40|$|There {{has been}} a longstanding debate about the {{potential}} contribution of chrysotile asbestos fibers to mesothelioma risk. The failure to resolve this debate has hampered decisive risk com-munication {{in the aftermath of}} the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and has influenced judgments about bans on asbestos use. A firm understanding of any health risks associated with natural chrysotile fibers is crucial for regulatory policy and future risk assessments of syn-thesized nanomaterials. Although epidemiological studies have confirmed amphibole asbestos fibers as a cause of mesothelioma, the link with chrysotile remains unsettled. An extensive re-view of the epidemiological cohort studies was undertaken to evaluate the extent of the evidence related to free chrysotile fibers, with particular attention to confounding by other fiber types, job exposure concentrations, and consistency of findings. The review of 71 asbestos cohorts exposed to <b>free</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibers does not support the hypothesis that chrysotile, uncontaminated by amphibolic substances, causes mesothelioma.

To reuse brine, diaphragm type chlor-alkali experiments were carried out to make alkaline solution and gases. For this purpose, a rectangular acrylic reactor, 66. 5 g/L of sodium chloride solution, a PTFE hydrophilic filter as <b>asbestos</b> <b>free</b> diaphragm, and IrO 2 coated titanium net or plate electrode were used. The experimental results show that sodium hydroxide concentration and chloride removal increased with higher current density, and had inverse linear correlations to the increasing flow rate.

Chloride removal and electric conductivity have a linear correlation with the sodium hydroxide concentration in effluent.

40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for many years as an {{ablation}} inhibitor in insulating materials. It has been a constituent of the AS/NBR insulation used to protect the steel case of the RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) since its inception. This paper discusses the development of a potential replacement RSRM insulation design, several of the numerous design issues that were worked and processing problems that were resolved. The earlier design demonstration on FSM- 5 (Flight Support Motor) of the selected 7 % and 11 % Kevlar(registered) filled EPDM (KF/EPDM) candidate materials was expanded. Full-scale process simulation articles were built and FSM- 8 was manufactured using multiple <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Free</b> (AF) components and materials. Two major problems had to be overcome in developing the AF design. First, bondline corrosion, which occurred in the double-cured region of the aft dome, had to be eliminated. Second, KF/EPDM creates high levels of electrostatic energy (ESE), which does not readily dissipate from the insulation surface. An uncontrolled electrostatic discharge (ESD) of this surface energy during many phases of production could create serious safety hazards. Numerous processing changes were implemented and a conductive paint was developed to prevent exposed external insulation surfaces from generating ESE/ESD. Additionally, special internal instrumentation was incorporated into FSM- 8 to record real-time internal motor environment data. These data included inhibitor insulation erosion rates and internal thermal environments. The FSM- 8 static test was successfully conducted in February 2000 and much valuable data were obtained to characterize the AF insulation design...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An analysis of a commercial vehicle drum brake fitted with a typical <b>asbestos</b> <b>free</b> friction material has been investigated by the finite element method. The "GAPFRIC" concept has been extended to model in three dimensions the frictional interface between brake linings and drum. This approach incorporates an accurate representation of the brake itself to include such features as the brake drum stiffener and mounting flange. The brake shoe representations include the actual web and platform thus {{eliminating the need for}} shoe stiffness approximations to a curved beam of uniform section as used in previous two dimensional work. The mechanical "GAPFRIC" analysis is combined with a thermal analysis of the brake to form a brake analysis package. The package is fully automatic; the output from each stage of the analysis is post processed and the results used to modify the original data file. Variations in physical properties exist between new and used friction material and these are incorporated in a five phase idealisation of the friction pair. Modifications to allow for the change of coefficient of friction with temperature were made by means of tables within the coding. In addition friction material wear was included in the analyses using an empirically derived wear criteria. Analyses were completed to investigate the effect of combined axial and circumferential distortions on temperatures at the friction interface, interfacial pressure distributions and subsequent brake performance. Predicted results show that high temperatures are reached at certain regions on the rubbing path and the temperatures may fluctuate during a brake application. Pressure variations are seen to exist both around and {{across the surface of the}} linings. The coupling of pressure and temperature variations combined with frictional changes over the lining produce changes that result in the frictional drag per unit area tending to be reasonably constant over the interface between drum and lining. The predicted values of brake torque and brake factor f rom the three dimensional analyses have been compared with results derived f rom the earlier two dimensional brake analysis and validated by comparison with measured results from a brake mounted on a dynamometer. Similarly predicted brake drum and lining temperatures were compared with measured values and some reasonable trends established. The work itself presents a better physical description of the behaviour at the friction surface during braking to improve the determination of brake drum performance...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos mining in South Africa {{has been}} carried out for more than a century. The Penge Mine started {{operations}} in 1914 and was closed in 1992. Following closure of the mine, the houses and mine buildings were used for residential purposes by former workers and by local inhabitants. The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) conducted rehabilitation of the asbestos mine dumps, following rehabilitation, the Limpopo Local Government proposed to declare the mine village a formal living area and this concerned a number of stakeholders, especially the Asbestos Relief Trust (ART). Dr Stephen Donohue, a former principal specialist in the Department of Health and Social Development, conducted a site visit to Penge in December 2006 to assess plans for development of the village and hospital. He found that the Penge area was heavily contaminated with amosite asbestos and was not suitable for human occupation. The objectives of this study were to review literature in order to explore and compare case studies from around the world on asbestos dump rehabilitation, to analyze and interpret soil, fauna and flora data collected by Rehabilitation Design and Construction (REDCO) Services and to critique the DME guidelines on rehabilitation of asbestos mine dumps. The results of the study highlighted that asbestos mining results in environmental contamination and health problems. The review of the case studies showed that the most common asbestos mine dump rehabilitation method is capping, whereby topsoil (<b>asbestos</b> <b>free)</b> is used to cover the mine dumps and indigenous vegetation is planted. Communities living in the vicinity of contaminated areas are either temporarily relocated during rehabilitation or they are permanently relocated in their best interests and the environment. Rehabilitation areas are usually fenced to restrict access to humans and animals. It was also noted in the case studies that extensive monitoring programs were developed in order to assess the success of the rehabilitation process. Asbestos fibres can contaminate the environment for many decades and monitoring programmes need to be of a long-term nature. to be of a long-term nature. iii Analyses and interpretation of the data collected by REDCO highlighted poor record keeping by DME on rehabilitation measures implemented at Penge, information was either incomplete or was not available. The dumps were capped with 300 mm topsoil and available information indicated that three different treatments were applied with respect to re-vegetation: 1) Dumps 1 and 2 were planted by spreading manure containing Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia tortilis seeds; 2) Dumps 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 received no treatments; 3) Dumps 9, 10 and 11 were planted with Euphorbia tirucali. No manure was applied. No grasses and forbs were planted during the rehabilitation of the dumps. There are no data on where the soil was sourced or its properties, hence, there was no baseline data for this study. Soil, fauna and vegetation data were collected by REDCO from the dumps in 2007. Whilst there were very few treatment effects, the results did indicate that significant amounts of vegetation had established on the dumps. It was noted that carbon levels were low and that organic matter should be added to the system for long term sustainability. The DME formulated technical guidelines on the rehabilitation of asbestos mine dumps in South Africa. Although the guidelines where formulated after rehabilitation of the mine dumps was complete, the dumps were rehabilitated according to the requirements of the guidelines. However, the requirement of monitoring following rehabilitation was not followed through in Penge. The DME guideline requirements are similar to the rehabilitation efforts implemented {{in other parts of the}} world. Dispersement of allocated funding from the DME to consultants and contractors limits rehabilitation of dumps in South Africa. Although the guidelines were not completely followed, this study identified some positive outcomes. The results presented in this project should be utilised as a baseline for future studies in order to determine the success or failure of rehabilitation efforts. Overall the study indicated that the Penge community was at risk of contracting asbestos related diseases and that the best solution for the local community would be permanent relocation. In addition, continuous monitoring should be conducted at Penge to monitor the success or failure of rehabilitation in the long term...|$|R
