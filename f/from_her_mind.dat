She bids farewell to his consciousness, which has finally left her own.|$|E
500|$|Lisa is {{transferred}} to Walter's lab, where he gives her special drugs to extract Rusk's thoughts <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Instead, Rusk gains control of Lisa's body and demands {{to know where he}} is. His description of the murderer leads them another naval officer, who tells them Rusk's physically abused wife Teresa (Annie Parisse) hired him for the murder. Believing that he has left her mind, they learn too late that Rusk is still in control of Lisa; he goes to exact revenge on Teresa, but is stopped by Peter before he can go through with the murder. Lisa is eventually able to purge Rusk from her consciousness. The final scene shows an unrelated car crash victim suddenly waking up, mumbling in Russian: [...] "My Star", the pet name Rusk called his wife, meaning that Rusk is back.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the psychical {{researcher}} Albert von Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carrière and claimed her ectoplasm [...] "materializations" [...] {{were the result}} of [...] "ideoplasty" [...] in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> Schrenck-Notzing published the book Phenomena of Materialisation (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string. Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room. The magician Carlos María de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.|$|E

All that was said came <b>from</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>mind</b> was so fully made up, as I have said before, no advice from me could avail anything. With some people {{it is easy to}} see that whether you agree with them or differ from them it is {{impossible}} to turn them." ...|$|R

60|$|Barbara did {{not hear}} him. She was {{standing}} {{in a sort of}} trance before the first husband, as if she had no consciousness of the other husband at her side. The mutilated features of Willowes had disappeared <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> eye; this perfect being was really the man she had loved, and not that later pitiable figure; in whom love and truth should have seen this image always, but had not done so.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the origin}} story printed in Adventure Comics #271 (April 1960), young Lex Luthor is shown as an {{aspiring}} scientist who resides in Smallville, the hometown of Superboy. The teenage Luthor saves Superboy from a chance encounter with kryptonite. In gratitude Superboy builds Luthor a laboratory, where weeks later {{he manages to}} create an artificial life-form, which Luthor loved {{as if it were}} his own child. Grateful in turn to Superboy, Luthor creates an antidote for kryptonite poisoning. However, an accidental fire breaks out in Luthor's lab. Superboy uses his super-breath to extinguish the flames, inadvertently spilling chemicals which cause Luthor to go bald; in the process, he also destroys Luthor's artificial life form. Believing Superboy intentionally destroyed his discoveries, Luthor attributes his actions to jealousy and vows revenge. Luthor's revenge first {{came in the form of}} grandiose engineering projects in Smallville to prove his superiority over the superhero. However, the gesture proves a failure on multiple levels; for one, Superboy does not feel belittled, but instead is gladly supportive of Luthor [...] pursuing his vindictive goal constructively. [...] Furthermore, those projects also each go disastrously out of control and require Superboy's intervention, which Luthor rationalized as being sabotaged by the superhero. These mounting embarrassments further deepen Lex's hate for Superboy for supposedly further humiliating him, and he unsuccessfully attempts to murder the superhero. This revised origin makes Luthor's fight with Superman a personal one, and suggests that if events had unfolded differently, Luthor might have been a more noble person. These elements were played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Elliot S. Maggin's novel [...] This revenge causes Luthor's family to disown him and change their names to Thorul. It also leads to years of Superman, Luthor, and Supergirl concealing the truth from Luthor's sister, Lena Thorul. She was told her brother died in a rock-climbing accident. She has ESP powers due to touching one of Luthor's inventions. Once she found out about Luthor being her brother and briefly lost her memory. However Luthor broke out of prison and gave her flowers he had developed that removed the bad memory <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

5000|$|So {{from the}} year 2009, up to the present, her works {{classified}} as surrealism, are now the images <b>from</b> <b>her</b> subconscious <b>mind.</b> Through this, {{she was able to}} create artworks that to others are [...] "morbid" [...] but oozing with mystical, esoteric and occult symbolism.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Billie, {{for there}} were no secrets between this girl and her father. At least, not many.

6000|$|She stopped abruptly. Once more her own indomitable earnestness {{had betrayed}} her. Once more the inborn nobility of that perverted nature had risen {{superior}} to the deception which it had stooped to practice. The scheme of the moment vanished <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind's</b> view; and the resolution of her life burst its way outward in her own words, in her own tones, pouring hotly and more hotly <b>from</b> <b>her</b> heart. She saw the abject manikin before her cowering, silent, in his chair. Had his fears left him sense enough to perceive the change in her voice? No: his face spoke the truth--his fears had bewildered him. This time the chance of the moment had befriended her. The door behind her chair had not opened again yet. [...] "No ears but his have heard me," [...] she thought, {{with a sense of}} unutterable relief. [...] "I have escaped Mrs. Lecount." ...|$|R

60|$|Bertha was perfectly, perilously happy. It {{was almost}} <b>her</b> first escape <b>from</b> the {{brooding}} care {{and weight of}} Haney's presence. She felt as she used to feel when speeding away on swift gallop to the ranch with some companion as care-free as herself. Since that fateful day when her mother fell ill and Marshall Haney {{asked her to marry}} him, she had not been permitted an hour's holiday. Even when absent <b>from</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> carried an inescapable picture of his loneliness and helplessness, and no complete relaxation had come with her temporary freedom. This day, this hour, she was suddenly free from care, from pain, from all uneasiness.|$|R
50|$|Her hobbies were reading, animals, old {{buildings}} and, of course, writing. Her writing career began almost by accident. It began {{when she heard}} {{a woman in her}} local library bemoaning the lack of good romance novels.

So she got a typewriter and developed what was to become a fantastic loving relationship with her millions of readers around the world.|$|R
60|$|Dolly {{felt that}} her father {{would be more likely}} to do it if she were not to {{interfere}} at all; but she could not say that. She did feel the request to be altogether unreasonable.

60|$|But in {{the morning}} when she woke her dream had entirely passed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> and she felt just as much like a colt as when she had gone to bed.|$|E
60|$|The {{ambiguous}} question drove every thought <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> {{filling it}} to overflowing {{with the supreme}} good of his presence, and the frantic hope that she had read aright the reason of it.|$|E

It confirmed her in her conviction that a girl must adventure into the city to win a place and a husband.|$|R

Mrs. Grantly, too, had ridiculed the Tickler match, and no too great niceness should now prevent Mrs. Proudie <b>from</b> speaking <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> about the Dumbello match.|$|R
