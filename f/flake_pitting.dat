40|$|Analysis of the {{corrosion}} resistance of AISI Type 304 Stainless Steel (SS) used in flare tips (burners) {{of natural gas}} (NG) extraction facilities is considered to determine the resistance of this grade of austenitic stainless steel to the aggressive corrosive actions of the environment. It was observed that the grade of SS yielded quite early to corrosion attacks which gave effects to scaling, <b>flaking,</b> <b>pitting,</b> material thinning and flare distortions in the burners contrary to expectations. This necessitated replacements with costs and thus there was need to analyse the causes and find {{solutions to the problem}} {{in such a way that}} a longer service time could be obtained with minimal shut downs. The solution was found in the grades of SS with balanced higher quantities of nickel, chromium, molybdenum and SS type with partial nitrogen substitution for nickel which helps in stabilization of the austenite structure. There was need to balance the contents of the alloying elements to ensure the desired microstructure is preserved. Further study is required in the area of “weld decay” caused by intergranular corrosion of the weld HAZ...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{artifacts}} {{were found}} during excavation of 35-Ti-1 in the 1950s. Some {{of the bone}} and antler objects found include: wedges, adzes, awls, needles, bi-pointed pins, blades, harpoon barbs, chisels, digging stick handles, and bone carvings with faces, perhaps from clubs or wand handles. One house pit included whalebone objects including a 1.5m x 0.3m (~5 ft x 1 ft) seat and a possible whale vertebrae seat surrounded by fire pits. Numerous stone artifacts were also found at the site, including: projectile points, blades, scrapers, gravers, core choppers, modified <b>flakes,</b> double <b>pitted</b> cobbles, hammerstones, and whetstones. The most recent occupation layer also contained trade goods including: rusted iron (perhaps knife blades), a copper pendant, and many sherds of Chinese porcelain.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, we {{describe}} the damage of a vehicle windshield caused by sandblasting erosion in Saharan climate conditions. In order to evaluate this damage, we carried out a survey on samples taken from a windshield that was used during {{two years in the}} region of Ouargla in the south of Algeria. The survey concerns primarily a description of the damage flaws (morphology, flaw size distribution and density) and an evaluation of the roughness and the optical transmission. The results show that the samples average flaw density (number of flaws per cm 2 surface) is 316 ± 65. The mean size based on a large number of flaws from all samples is 245 ± 128 μm. Microscopic observations reveal that the flaws vary also in their morphologies. The main flaw types (micro-cracks, <b>flakes</b> and <b>pits)</b> extend differently in length and depth. The evaluation of the optical transmission reveals a decrease from 92 % down to 58 % using a light flux normal to the glass samples surface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRetouchers are {{fragments}} of bone {{used during the}} Paleolithic to strike stone flakes in order to transform them into retouched tools. Our experiments show that the mark produced on retouchers differs depending on whether {{they were used to}} strike flint or quartzite. Our results suggest that numerous pits, most often with an ovoid form, characterize the retouching of quartzite flakes. Most of the scores produced with this material have a sinuous morphology with rough interior faces. The areas with superposed traces have a pitted appearance. On the other hand, the retouching of flint <b>flakes,</b> produces <b>pits</b> that are most often triangular in form. Most of the scores have a rectilinear morphology with smooth interior faces and their superposition results in the formation of hatch marks. There is also a relationship between the characteristics of the mark and the relative state of freshness of the retouchers. The validity of the criteria identified was confirmed by a blind test. These diagnostic criteria were applied to archaeological retouchers from the Mousterian site of Noisetier Cave. The results obtained improve our knowledge of the technical behaviors of Neanderthals and allow us to address questions concerning their techno-economic implications...|$|R
40|$|The Mir Environmental Effects Package (MEEP) was {{deployed}} on the Mir {{station and}} retrieved after 18 months in space. The payload included the orbital debris collector (ODC), {{designed and built}} at the Johnson Space Center to capture and return analyzable residues of the man-made and natural particulate environment in low-Earth orbit for a detailed assessment of its compositional makeup and potential origins. The ODC exposed 2 identical trays, with highly porous, low-density SiO 2 aerogel as the basic collector medium, pointed in opposite directions. The aerogel was expected to gently decelerate and capture hypervelocity particles, as opposed to other media that resulted in melting or vaporization of many impactors. Even cursory examination of the returned ODC collectors revealed a surprising variety of impact features. The compositional analyses using scanning electron "miccroscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy concentrated on a survey-type inventory of diverse particle types and associated impact features. Detections, {{in the form of}} carrot-shaped tracks and shallow pits, included metallic Al, stainless steel, soldering compounds, human waste, and paint <b>flakes.</b> Many <b>pits</b> contained no detectable impactor residue (it was assumed to have vaporized), but most of the tracks contained analyzable residue. The study showed that aerogel would be useful for future low-velocity impact analysis...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of field, laboratory and micromorphological evidence, this study examines tafoni (singular, tafone) in the El Chorro area of Andalucia, southern Spain, and makes inferences concerning the processes responsible for their formation. Twenty-five tafoni were randomly selected for field examination. The morphology of these cavernous rock domes {{is characterized by a}} helmet-shaped outer roof and an arched-shaped cavern, often with a partially overhanging visor; measurements of height, width and depth of the caverns revealed marked variations in size. The presence or absence of lichen cover, surface varnish, overhanging visor, cavern backwall stripes, rock <b>flaking,</b> weathering <b>pits</b> and cavern floor sediments was also noted. Surface hardness values, obtained using a Schmidt hammer, are relatively low but significantly higher on the outer roof of the tafoni than on the inner cavern walls. Analysis of sediment samples collected from the cavern backwalls and floors indicates predominantly sandy textures, alkaline pH values and some base cation enrichment. Micromorphological analysis of thin sections, prepared from undisturbed blocks, reveals large quantities of pore-filling cement, consisting mainly of calcite, mineral grains affected by weathering and pseudomorphic replacement, and dark, rounded nodules with a metallic appearance. In terms of their formation, different processes appear to act on different parts of the landform. On the outer roof surfaces, case hardening, resulting from near-surface cementation and surface varnish development, is dominant. On the inner cavern surfaces, however, core softening, resulting from granular disintegration and flaking, dominates. Exfoliation weathering, running water and wind deflation also appear {{to play an important role}} in tafone formation. A phased model of tafone evolution is proposed whereby the features pass through four phases of development–initiation, enlargement, amalgamation and degradation; in the study area there are examples of tafoni in each of these phases. Much of the evidence suggests that the tafoni are actively developing under current environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Investigating {{openwork}} block accumulation has {{the potential}} to further our understanding of rock weathering, the control of geological structure on landforms, the production of substrates for biological colonisation and the impacts of climate change on landform development and dynamics. Various models for the development of these landforms have been proposed. This includes in situ weathering, frost heave and wedging. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} cold-based ice {{has the potential}} to preserve these features rather than to obliterate them. Blocky deposits are also frequently used as proxy evidence for interpreting palaeoclimates. The morphology and processes acting on a blockfield located on the Northern Buttress of the Vesleskarvet Nunataks, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica (2 °W, 71 °S) were investigated and characterised. Given block dimensions and orientations that closely resembled the parent material and only small differences in aspect related characteristics observed, the blockfield was found to be autochthonous with in situ block production and of a young (Holocene) age. Small differences in rock hardness measurements suggest some form of aspect control on rock weathering. South-facing sides of clasts were found to be the least weathered. In comparison, consistently low rock hardness rebound values for the north-facing aspects suggest that these are the most weathered sides. Additional indicators of weathering, such as <b>flaking</b> and <b>pitting,</b> support analyses conducted for rock hardness rebound values. Solar radiation received, slope gradients and snow cover were found to influence weathering of clasts across the study site. Furthermore, ambient temperatures and wind speed significantly influenced near-surface ground temperatures dynamics. However, the lack of a matrix and paucity of fine material in textural analyses suggest a limited weathering environment. It is suggested that the retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last LGM led to unloading of the surface, causing dilatation and subsequent fracturing of the bedrock along pre-existing joints, leading to in situ clast supply. Subsequent weathering and erosion along other points or lines of weakness then yielded fines and slight edge rounding of clasts...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 13 collections of 8 species of Ascarina. Wood anatomy is maximally primitive in most respects; moderate exception {{occurs in the}} imperforate tracheary elements, which range from tracheidlike (A. solmsiana) to fiber-tracheids (septate in two species). Perforation plates are scalariform, average more than 100 bars per plate, and have bordered bars. Even more significantly, portions of the primary walls in perforations characteristically fail to dissolve; these pit membrane portions range from nearly intact (much like the pit membranes in pits on end walls of tracheids of vesselless dicotyledons) to remnant strands or <b>flakes.</b> Dissolution of <b>pit</b> membranes in perforations is apparently inhibited by deposition of resinlike substances in some species; the rugose surfaces formed by these deposits may account for a report of vesturing on vessel walls of Ascarina. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with only very small expressions of diversification; apotracheal banded parenchyma is, however, present in A. swamyana. Wood of Ascarina is highly mesomorphic. With age of plant, vessels increase in diameter, vessel elements and fiber-tracheids increase in length, and rays become wider and have {{a higher proportion of}} procumbent cells; uniseriate rays decrease in abundance. The implications of wood anatomy data on generic distinctions within the family and on the systematic position of Chloranthaceae will be examined when monographs on woods of the other genera have been completed...|$|R
40|$|The {{active surface}} area {{progression}} {{which takes place}} in natural graphite flakes during oxidation is difficult to model analytically. A probability based simulation was developed to represent the observed behaviour. The simulation is simple and capable of easily representing complex geometries such as randomized structures or curved contours which would be difficult and time consuming to model analytically. The probability used in the simulation is directly linked to the kinetic parameters. These parameters and conversion behaviour were experimentally measured for a high purity, flake natural graphite sample. In addition, the sample was partially oxidized and extensively examined under a scanning electron microscope. Three characteristic microstructures were identified in the oxidized sample. These structures were qualitatively approximated by three simulated structures. Two of the three simulations were unable to effectively represent the initial region of the conversion function where it increases towards a maximum. The complete behaviour was accurately represented by the simulation of a square flake with a few randomly positioned pits growing in the flake structure. The simulation illustrates that the initial increase {{is due to the}} growth of the pits within the larger <b>flake</b> structure. The <b>pits</b> were found to be caused by catalytic impurities. Thus by demonstrating this is a rate controlling factor the simulation enables the practical insight that the oxidation resistance can be significantly improved if these small impurities are removed.

40|$|Plastics are an {{integral}} part of everyday life, and the use of plastic products for consumer goods, food packaging, recreational and commercial fishing and medical and sanitary applications continues to increase. The durability, low cost, light weight and hydrophobic nature of plastic make it a desirable material for numerous applications; however, these same characteristics make plastic debris in natural environments a pervasive problem. Increases in plastic use and low economic incentive for recovery, result in accumulation of debris in marine environments. Degradation of plastics through chemical weathering occurs in the open ocean or along shorelines where polymers are exposed to seawater and UVB radiation. Plastic particles were both experimentally degraded, and sampled from beaches on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, U. S. A. and in and near Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland, Canada. Daily accumulation rates of 484 pieces per day were recorded in Kauai and approximately 6000 plastic particles were collected over a 10 day period. Relationships between composition, surface textures and level of oxidation were studied using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). Surface textural analysis showed evidence of cracks, fractures, <b>flakes,</b> grooves, <b>pits,</b> adhering particles and vermiculate textures. Increased surface oxidation of different polymer types was determined by measuring increased IR absorbance in the 1710 cm- 1 wavenumber region of the IR spectra. Results obtained from both analytical techniques indicate a strong relationship between chemical and mechanical degradation of plastics, suggesting that plastics degrade most efficiently on beaches compared with other natural environments. Vermiculate textures were only present on polyethylene particles sampled from Kauai indicating that biological activity, water salinity or temperature may play key roles in the degradation of plastics in subtropical climates. Analysis of debris collected from Kauaiian beaches indicates that small particles and pellets comprise the largest portion of plastics which is in contrast to Newfoundland beaches which have more intact and nearly intact debris relative to the overall plastic load. Size distribution of plastic debris closely mimicked natural sedimentary grain size distribution in natural environments suggesting that plastics may become a significant component of the sedimentary deposit record...|$|R
40|$|An archaeological {{survey of}} three {{proposed}} well pad sites, two proposed access roads, and two frac pit sites at the Ferguson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Madison County, Texas {{was performed by}} Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on July 27 and 29 and August 6 and 18, 2010. The project was conducted under Antiquities Permit 5714. The client is Navidad Resources, LLC. The total area investigated consisted of 19. 2 acres. Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area was revealed {{by the presence of}} three flakes at well location 1 - 1, one flake at well location 2 - 1, and three <b>flakes</b> at Frac <b>Pit</b> 1. The <b>flakes</b> are small interior flakes, and it is believed that they are the result of tool refurbishing activities and not indicative of an actual site worthy of a state trinomial. Historic artifacts were found at well location 2 - 1 and consist of three fragments of whiteware, two fragments of clear glass, and a metal bolt. In addition a fragment of mammal bone was found. According to prison personnel, the area where the historic artifacts were found had been used in the past as a place for dumping trash. Due to the sparse amount of materials recovered, this area was not considered to be worthy of an official site number. The artifacts from both areas have been discarded, as they are not considered significant and worthy of curation Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the Texas State Library, Navidad Resources, LLC, the Ferguson Unit, and BVRA...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{suffer from}} {{localised}} attack termed exfoliation corrosion which is intergranular in nature where the attack proceeds around the elongated grains {{present in the}} microstructure. The formation of a more voluminous corrosion product than the original material results in the lifting of grains giving the characteristic of exfoliation corrosion - lamellar attack. This results in surface degredation {{in the form of}} <b>pitting,</b> <b>flaking</b> or blistering. The precipitates present within the microstructure and the grain shape can alter how susceptible the material is to exfoliation corrosion. The distribution of precipitates present can be altered by heat treatment which affects the exfoliation corrosion susceptibility. A study on the effects of heat treatment and grain shape on exfoliation corrosion has been completed for two AlCuMg alloys (2014 and 2024) and two aluminium - lithium alloys (8090 and 2091). A MASTMAASIS salt - spray cabinet was used to determine the exfoliation corrosion susceptibility of all the alloys. A four - point bend test was developed to determine the depth of penetration and compared to depths measured metallographically. The results for the 2 XXX series alloys suggest that as the grain aspect ratio increases the exfoliation susceptibility increases. Although the aspect ratio did not differ greatly between each alloy, the different phases present in the two alloys seem to contribute more markedly to the susceptibility. Heat treatment in the 2024 alloy suggested that the peak - aged condition gave a higher susceptibility to corrosion than the under - aged and over - aged conditions. Results indicated that the heat treatment has a greater effect on exfoliation corrosion than the grain aspect ratio, showing that the grain boundary microstructure {{is an important factor in}} the exfoliation process. The four - point bend test tended to underestimate the depth of attack by virtue of measuring the whole area of the specimen whereas metallographic measurements only took into account the attacked areas. End grain testing suggested that the attack can not only proceed longitudinally but also "short - circuit" down the transverse path of the elongated grains in the 2 XXX series alloys. For the aluminium - lithium alloys the over - aged condition showed more resistance to attack than the under - aged and peak - aged conditions but the under - aged was more resistant to attack for the 2091 alloy. Stress corrosion cracking showed trends similar to exfoliation corrosion...|$|R
