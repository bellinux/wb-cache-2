25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; <b>for,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|After {{some months}} in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a [...] dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was {{generally}} considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. [...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{months after}} his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Maria sought {{consolation}} in her faith and in April was admitted {{as a member of}} the First Reformed Dutch Church. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me." [...] According to Arvin's influential suggestion, with Melville, one has to reckon with the [...] "tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician." ...|$|E

And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams.
