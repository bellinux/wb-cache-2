25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the founders}} of the CCF – {{including}} Woodsworth, Tommy Douglas, M. J. Coldwell, and Stanley Knowles,– were informed by the Social Gospel, to which Lewis, with his Marxist socialism balanced by the Bund's democratic principles, felt an affinity. Both the Bund and the Social Gospel were focused on the material present rather than the afterlife. [...] Both called on people to change their environment for the better rather than hoping that God might <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Social justice, the brotherhood of man, and moral self-improvement were common to both.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's tenure {{marked a}} {{difference}} in policy: {{instead of trying to}} divide and rule and undermine the power of the hereditary chiefs, he granted considerable authority to them. He applied a similar approach to that of his previous work in Basutoland. His view was that the native people were [...] "better able to manage their own affairs than we can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> though they need our help in international matters and in matters between white and black." [...] He gave special judicial functions to Hlubi of the Basotho, Mehlokazulu of the Ngobese and Mpiyakhe of the Mdlalose, enabling them to try certain cases referred to them by Resident Magistrates. In 1895, according to Harriette Colenso, the Zulu people approved of direct rule with Clarke as Resident Commissioner. However, when Clarke was appointed Resident Commissioner in Rhodesia in 1898, Charles Saunders replaced him and he bowed to pressure from settlers and officials to minimise Dinuzulu's influence over the Zulu people, especially during the Second Boer War.|$|E

500|$|Joey {{returns to}} his {{apartment}} to fetch the chick and the duck he was hiding, but finds they have become trapped in the foosball table. Chandler and Joey decide to break it open when they cannot find any other way of getting the birds out. Phoebe's reckless driving gets her and Ross to JFK Airport and, after buying a ticket to get past security, they search the information boards for Rachel's flight number. When they cannot locate her flight {{on any of the}} information boards, Ross calls and checks the number with Monica but discovers they are at the wrong airport; Ross and Phoebe drove to JFK, while Rachel was flying out of nearby Newark Airport. Phoebe phones Rachel, who has already boarded her flight, to stall her for time. When a passenger (Jim Rash) overhears Phoebe saying {{there is a problem with}} the fictitious [...] "left phalange" [...] of the plane, he gets off the plane, prompting everyone else to leave. Chandler and Joey, who are emotionally attached to the foosball table, find they are unable to bear breaking it open, so Monica nonchalantly offers to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Bob Katz {{announced}} on his website that [...] "The last {{battle of the}} loudness war has been won", claiming that Apple's mandatory use of Sound Check for iTunes Radio meant that [...] "The way to turn the loudness race around right now, is for every producer and mastering engineer to ask their clients if they have heard iTunes Radio. When they respond in the affirmative, the engineer/producer tells them they need {{to turn down the}} level of their song(s) to the standard level or iTunes Radio will <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> He or she should also explain that overcompressed material sounds [...] "wimpy" [...] and [...] "small" [...] in comparison to more open material on iTunes Radio." [...] He believes this will eventually result in producers and engineers making more dynamic masters to take account of this factor. His point of view has been widely reported and discussed.|$|E

60|$|In fact, {{furnishing}} amusements for the people, {{and also}} providing supplies for their wants, {{as well as}} affording them protection, were considered the legitimate objects of government in those days. It is very different at the present time, and especially in this country. The whole community are now united in the desire to confine the functions of government within the narrowest possible limits, such as to include only the preservation of public order and public safety. The people prefer to supply their own wants and to provide their own enjoyments, rather than to invest government {{with the power to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> knowing very well that, on the latter plan, the burdens they will have to bear, though concealed for a time, must be doubled in the end.|$|E

But such, as an historic fact, has been the last stage of every civilisation--even that of Rome, which ripened itself upon this earth the last in ancient times, and, I had almost said, until this very day, except among the men who speak Teutonic tongues, and who have preserved through all temptations, and reasserted through all dangers, the free ideas which have been our sacred heritage ever since Tacitus beheld us, with respect and awe, among our German forests, and saw in us the future masters of the Roman Empire.|$|E
