5|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} {{by reducing the}} narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> exciting thing now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E

5000|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, [...] "This is <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> group's <b>most</b> {{scattered}} album, as {{it offers}} various shades of ballads, some throwbacks, oddly escapist adult alternative fare, and even anthemic rockers. Many of them blur {{the line between}} fresh changes of pace and ill-suited switch-ups. [...] "Already Gone," [...] one that falls toward the latter, is schizophrenic itself, as it bounds between early-'80s arena rock and EDM. It's also one of many songs in which Auto-Tune is used -- <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> album's <b>most</b> baffling characteristic." ...|$|R

25|$|Since 1960, Tallahassee has {{achieved}} a remarkable attitudinal change. In the area of racism, it has gone from arguably the most racist city in the state—and Florida from 1900 to 1930 led the country in lynchings per capita—to {{one of the most}} tolerant.

25|$|Other {{ionization}} methods may {{not require}} the liquid sample to be vaporized, and can analyze the liquid sample itself.

25|$|The Congress of Samasamaja Youth Leagues and {{the other}} bodies {{affiliated}} to the party (membership of the party proper was still restricted to a small cadre, on a Leninist model) saw unprecedented growth at this time.

Leslie Goonewardene, <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> cosmopolitan of the party's leaders, established contact with the 'Captains' of the Movement of the Armed Forces ('Movimento das Forças Armadas' - MFA) of Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of April 1974; he also became a theoretician of Eurocommunism and its application to Sri Lanka, writing a pamphlet 'Can we Get To Socialism This Way'.|$|E

25|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly {{north to}} south for about 7miles, {{remaining}} above 2,000ft (600m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form {{of many of these}} fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.|$|E
25|$|Christa Miller as Ellie Torres – Jules' feisty {{next door}} {{neighbor}} and best friend. A former corporate attorney turned stay-at-home mother, Ellie is <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> intellectual among the group. She is married to Andy Torres, and the two have a son named Stan. She is Jules' sarcastic, unapologetic confidante who takes pleasure in teasing Laurie, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bobby, Grayson and Travis. Ellie's hard-polished guardedness belies a fierce loyalty. Ellie is a somewhat reluctant mother, demanding a nanny despite being a stay-at-home mom. She is usually quite dominant over Andy, who adores her. In Season 6, she goes back to her corporate attorney job, after becoming bored and learning that Andy really wants to be a stay-at-home dad.|$|E
25|$|China was <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{successful}} nation, {{topping the}} medal tally with thirteen gold medals and 26 medals in total.

Second-placed Japan (with four golds) had a much larger overall haul, taking 22 medals at the competition. Chinese Taipei placed third with four golds and thirteen medals in total, while India had the third highest medal tally, with fourteen medals. Among the 21 nations that won medals in Hanoi, Thailand, Qatar and Bahrain were others to feature prominently on the podiums.

25|$|In addition, the Colts left an {{indelible}} imprint on Hartford's architectural environment. Samuel Colt {{was inspired by}} {{what he had seen}} during a trip to London in 1851, and he embarked upon one of the boldest real estate development campaigns in Hartford's history. His intention was to build an industrial community to house his workers adjacent to the Colt Armory. By 1856, it was a city within a city, where workers of many nationalities and religions worked and lived alongside one another. Coltsville was among the first of America's 19th century company towns, and it was <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> advanced of its time—though not the largest, the most prominent, or the most tightly controlled. Colt's complex also included the largest armory in the world, as well as wharf and ferry facilities on the Connecticut River.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus' {{victories}} came in 1966, 1970, and 1978. Although his {{tally of}} three wins {{is the least}} of his majors, it greatly understates how prominent Nicklaus was at the Open throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He finished runner-up seven times, which is the record and had a total of sixteen top-5 finishes, which is tied most in Open history with John Henry Taylor and <b>easily</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> in the postwar era. Nicklaus also holds the records for most rounds under par (61) and most aggregates under par (14). At Turnberry in 1977 {{he was involved in}} one of the most celebrated contests in golf history, when his duel with Tom Watson went to the final shot before Watson emerged as the champion for the second time with a record score of 268 (12 under par).|$|E
