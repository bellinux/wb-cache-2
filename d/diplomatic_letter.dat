5|$|In 1370, {{following}} the ousting of the Mongols from China {{and the establishment}} of the Chinese Ming dynasty, the Pope sent a new mission to China, comprising the Parisian theologian Guillaume du Pré as the new archbishop and 50 Franciscans. However, this mission disappeared, apparently eliminated by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of Ming. The Ming Hongwu Emperor sent a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>letter</b> to the Byzantine Empire, through a European in China named Nieh-ku-lun. John V Palaiologos was the Byzantine Emperor at the time the message was sent by Hongwu, with the proclamatory letter informing him about the establishment of the new Ming dynasty. The message was sent to the Byzantine ruler in September 1371 when Hongwu met with the merchant Nieh-ku-lun (捏古倫) from Fu lin (Byzantium). The Khanbaliq bishop Nicolaus de Bentra is speculated to be the same person as Nieh-ku-lun, for instance, by Emil Bretschneider in 1888. More recently, Edward N. Luttwak (2009) also mused that Nicolaus de Bentra and this alleged Byzantine merchant Nieh-ku-lin were one in the same.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{instances}} {{of interaction between}} Buddhism and the Roman Empire are documented by Classical and early Christian writers. Roman historical accounts describe an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion (Pandya?), also named Porus, to Augustus around 13 CE. The embassy was travelling with a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>letter</b> in Greek, {{and one of its}} members—called Zarmanochegas—was an Indian religious man (sramana) who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event created a sensation and was described by Nicolaus of Damascus, who met the embassy at Antioch, and related by Strabo (XV,1,73) and Dio Cassius. A tomb was made for Zarmanochegas, still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the following inscription, [...] "ΖΑΡΜΑΝΟΧΗΓΑΣ ΙΝΔΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΒΑΡΓΟΣΗΣ" [...] ("Zarmanochegas from Barygaza in India").|$|E

2500|$|They are {{not said}} to clearly mention Buddhist monks (common in the Maurya era), but Greek {{accounts}} of shramanas {{are thought to}} correspond to them. An inscription on a Greek tomb is reported to read, [...] "Here lies Indian Sramanacharya, Shakya monk from Bodh Gaya". However, in 1000 BC the Greeks did not yet use an alphabet and the inscription has been dated to 10 CE. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote an account of a diplomatic mission sent by an Indian king [...] "named Pandion (Pandyan kingdom) or, according to others, Porus" [...] to Caesar Augustus about 13 CE who met with the ambassador at Antioch. The mission had a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>letter</b> in Greek, {{and one of its}} members was a Sarmano (...) who immolated himself in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event was cited by Strabo and Dio Cassius. A tomb was made for the sarmano (still visible at the time of Plutarch), which read [...] "ΖΑΡΜΑΝΟΧΗΓΑΣ ΙΝΔΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΒΑΡΓΟΣΗΣ" [...] (Zarmanochēgas Indos apo Bargosēs; [...] "The sramana master from Barygaza in India").|$|E
2500|$|Nicolaus of Damascus {{describes}} an embassy {{sent by the}} [...] "Indian king Porus (or Pandion, Pandya or Pandita (Buddhism)) to Caesar Augustus. The embassy traveled with a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>letter</b> on a skin in Greek. One of its members was a sramana who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. Nicholas of Damascus met the embassy at Antioch (near present day Antakya in Turkey) and this is related by Strabo (XV,1,73 [...] ) and Dio Cassius (liv, 9). The monk's self-immolation made a sensation and was quoted by Strabo and Dio Cassius (Hist 54.9). His tomb indicated he came from Barygaza which is now Bharuch city of Gujarat, near the north bank of the Narmada River; the name being derived {{from one of the}} ancient Rishis (Bhrigu) who lived there. If the Sramana timed his death to match the arrival of Augustus in Athens then the date would be the winter of 22/21 BC when Augustus crossed from Sicily to Greece to visit Athens (Dio Cassius LIV,7, 2-3). In support of this, Priaulx notes that the poet Horace alludes to an Indian mission (Carmen Seculare 55, 56 (written 17 BC), Ode 14, L.iv (13 BC) and Ode 12, L. i (22 BC)). Priaulx also notes that later writers such as Florus (110 AD) (Hist. Rome IV C 12) and Suetonius (190 AD) (Augustus C21) refer to this Indian mission. Augustus in his Ancyra inscription notes that [...] "to me were sent embassies of kings from India, who had never been seen in the camp of any Roman general." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1699 a fair copy of {{the laws}} and acts of the colony was finally sent to Bellomont, with a letter {{explaining}} the delay.

[...] The reply from the commissioners the next day declared that the {{copy of the}} laws was neither complete nor correct, and condemned the arrests made at Westerly. [...] The colony's laws were sent to the Board of Trade with abundant annotations and denunciations by Bellomont. [...] The Board of Trade, upon receipt of Bellomont's report, sent an abstract to the King in April 1700, recommending that the law officers of the crown consider what would be most proper for bringing the colony under a better form of government. [...] At the May elections in 1700, John Greene, who had been deputy governor for ten years, was dropped, and former Governor Walter Clarke was chosen in his place. [...] At the close of the Assembly Cranston addressed a petition to the King imploring the continuance of the charter. [...] He also wrote the Board of Trade informing them that the late deputy governor had been left out of all offices of trust at the recent election on account of his illegally granting privateer commissions several years earlier. [...] He also added that a more perfect copy of the laws was to be made, and that a new form of engagement had just been adopted to meet the views of the home government.
