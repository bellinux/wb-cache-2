5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is <b>hoarding</b> all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's <b>hoarding</b> of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control of the food supply.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, while in search of deuterium, Enterprise discovers a mining colony that is being controlled by Klingons who are bullying the inhabitants and <b>hoarding</b> their supplies. The crew conduct repairs on the colony and train the colonists to fight off the Klingons.|$|E
50|$|The Vale of York <b>Hoard,</b> {{also known}} as the Harrogate <b>Hoard</b> and the Vale of York Viking <b>Hoard,</b> is a 10th-century Viking <b>hoard</b> of 617 silver coins and 65 other items. It was found {{undisturbed}} in 2007 near the town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire, England. The <b>hoard</b> was the largest Viking one discovered in Britain since 1840, when the Cuerdale <b>hoard</b> was found in Lancashire, though the Anglo-Saxon Staffordshire <b>Hoard,</b> found in 2009, is larger.|$|R
50|$|Upon W. D. <b>Hoard's</b> death, the {{publishing}} of <b>Hoard's</b> was passed onto his son, Frank Ward <b>Hoard,</b> in 1918 {{and then to}} his grandson, William D. <b>Hoard,</b> Jr. in 1939.|$|R
50|$|There are two notable Ipswich <b>Hoards.</b> The {{first was}} a <b>hoard</b> of Anglo-Saxon coins {{discovered}} in 1863. The second was a <b>hoard</b> of six Iron Age gold torcs that was discovered in 1968 and 1969. The latter <b>hoard</b> {{has been described as}} second only to the Snettisham <b>Hoard</b> in importance as a <b>hoard</b> from the Iron Age, and is held at the British Museum.|$|R
5|$|This bank, {{like many}} other banks, lost fifty percent of its {{deposits}} within as many days because of the panic, which frightened people and caused them to withdraw their funds for <b>hoarding</b> throughout the United States and led creditors to strenuously press their debtors for settlement... This panic demonstrated the complete instability of the financial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly defective banking system.|$|E
5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction <b>hoarding.</b> There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the rails and sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, <b>hoarding</b> other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
50|$|Ten Late Minoan I metal <b>hoards</b> were {{recently}} excavated at Mochlos. Among them are foundry <b>hoards,</b> traders' <b>hoards</b> and ceremonial assemblages. Lead isotope analyses indicate that copper oxhide ingots and fragments from these <b>hoards</b> originated in Cyprus.|$|R
40|$|The {{first volume}} of Egyptian <b>Hoards</b> offers a {{complete}} list of 278 <b>hoards</b> containing Ptolemaic coins in gold, silver, or bronze, found in Egypt and in the sphere of influence of the Lagid kings. Forty-nine of these <b>hoards</b> are documented here for the first time. The volume consists predominantly of articles presenting and analyzing the new <b>hoards,</b> enlarged <b>hoards,</b> and older <b>hoards</b> restudied in light of recent numismatic scholarship. For the most part the articles are generously illustrated: the plates feature more than 3500 coins in color. Following {{in the tradition of the}} Inventory of Greek Coin <b>Hoards</b> (IGCH) and the ten volumes of Coin <b>Hoards</b> (CH), Egyptian <b>Hoards</b> I collects and analyzes the coin <b>hoards</b> which constitute a major contribution to the study of the monetarization of Egypt and the circulation of coinage in the country, with very important implications for our understanding of the economy of the region...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hoards</b> {{provide a}} useful method of {{providing}} dates for artifacts through association {{as they can}} usually be assumed to be contemporary (or at least assembled during a decade or two), and therefore used in creating chronologies. <b>Hoards</b> {{can also be considered}} an indicator of the relative degree of unrest in ancient societies. Thus conditions in 5th and 6th century Britain spurred the burial of <b>hoards,</b> of which the most famous are the Hoxne <b>Hoard,</b> Suffolk; the Mildenhall Treasure, the Fishpool <b>Hoard,</b> Nottinghamshire, the Water Newton <b>hoard,</b> Cambridgeshire, and the Cuerdale <b>Hoard,</b> Lancashire, all preserved in the British Museum.|$|R
5|$|Graves was {{a pillar}} of the Los Alamos community. He was {{an active member of}} the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the {{encouragement}} of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the cello, <b>hoarding</b> his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for lessons. He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel's Messiah. He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|In Grenada, the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the <b>hoarding</b> {{of food in}} the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later announced that it would send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that <b>hoarding</b> his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
50|$|The National Dairy Shrine's {{museum is}} located in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.

25|$|Comparison of {{multiple}} coin <b>hoards</b> {{can help to}} establish relative chronologies; if a series of coins is well represented in one large coin <b>hoard</b> and some are missing from a second large <b>hoard,</b> {{it is likely that}} they were minted after that <b>hoard</b> was buried.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, {{according}} to Lönnqvist, claiming an earlier {{date for the}} silver <b>hoards</b> is untenable and contradicts the first complete recording of the Qumran silver <b>hoards</b> made by him in 2007, which includes the first photographic evidence of the coin <b>hoards,</b> and the regional coin evidence from other <b>hoards.</b> It has already been shown that de Vaux's dating system of Qumran and the silver coin <b>hoards</b> was based on what is generally known as a circular argument; {{the end of the}} first major settlement period was dated after the assumed date of hiding of the coin <b>hoards,</b> which in turn dated the coin <b>hoards</b> themselves.|$|R
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show <b>hoarding</b> behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{is stored}} year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store {{the seeds of the}} Siberian stone pine, sometimes <b>hoarding</b> enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. <b>Hoarding</b> is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to <b>hoarding,</b> black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E

The Courtesan apologetically confirms Onesiphorus' allegation, but {{is quick to point}} out that she told <b>Hoard</b> that she didn't have any money when he first proposed. <b>Hoard</b> is infuriated.|$|R
50|$|The Trier Gold <b>Hoard</b> is a <b>hoard</b> of 2516 (or 2518) {{gold coins}} with a weight of 18.5 kg found in Trier, Germany in September 1993 during {{construction}} works. It {{is described as}} the largest preserved Roman gold <b>hoard</b> worldwide. The <b>hoard</b> is on exhibition at the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier.|$|R
5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A <b>hoarding</b> remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the <b>hoarding</b> and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began <b>hoarding</b> copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E

5|$|Castles saw an {{increasing}} use of arrowslits by the 13th century, especially in England, almost certainly linked {{to the introduction of}} crossbows. These arrowslits were combined with firing positions from the tops of the towers, initially protected by wooden <b>hoarding</b> until stone machicolations were introduced in England in the late 13th century. The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I; many crossbows and vast numbers of quarrels were needed to supply royal forces, in turn requiring larger scale iron production. In England, crossbows were primarily made at the Tower of London but St Briavels Castle, with the local Forest of Dean available to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture. In Scotland, Edinburgh Castle became the centre for the production of bows, crossbows and siege engines for the king.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} <b>hoarding</b> of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|Following the California {{gold rush}} {{that began in}} 1849 and the Australian gold rush that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into {{commerce}} than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels. This resulted in {{a decrease in the}} value of gold and an increase in the relative value of silver. As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to <b>hoarding</b> or melting. In response, Congress authorized the Mint to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the three-cent piece and silver dollar. Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose and the price decreased. During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and paper currency.|$|E
50|$|The Tregwynt <b>Hoard</b> is a mid-17th century <b>hoard</b> {{of coins}} found at Tregwynt Mansion near Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in 1996.

50|$|The <b>hoard</b> {{represents}} {{the scale of}} international connections in the Early Medieval period, with Russian and Irish influences among the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian elements.

50|$|In 1889, {{the house}} was sold to {{attorney}} W. H. Rogers. Rogers served as town clerk in 1868 and 1870-1871 and was a {{justice of the peace}} from 1868 to 1872. He was city attorney from 1870 until his death in 1907 and served a term as mayor. Arthur R. <b>Hoard,</b> the son of Governor William D. <b>Hoard,</b> purchased the house in 1893. In 1885, <b>Hoard</b> had founded the periodical that would become <b>Hoard's</b> Dairyman and a year later he founded <b>Hoard</b> Creameries. <b>Hoard</b> developed the company into a chain of eight creameries, known for making its GiltEdge butter. In 1912, he purchased stock in the Better Sox Knitting Mills, eventually becoming its president. <b>Hoard</b> served a term as mayor and owned <b>Hoard's</b> Hotel on Lake Koshkonong. The house was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1982.
