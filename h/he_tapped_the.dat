5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>the</b> ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted for Martin Keown right away as he struggled to play on.|$|E
25|$|Davis' appointees in {{the second}} term {{included}} outgoing State Representative Claude Kirkpatrick of Jennings, the seat of Jefferson Davis Parish, who was named to succeed Lorris M. Wimberly as the Director of Public Works. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with Texas to establish the popular Toledo Bend Reservoir, a haven for boating and fishing. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former Edith Killgore, a native of Claiborne Parish, headed Davis' women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman Morgan W. Walker, Sr., to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of Continental Trailways Bus lines. Davis named as state highway director Ray Burgess of Baton Rouge, who considered running for governor in the 1963 primary. <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>the</b> attorney Frank Voelker, Jr., of Lake Providence, to chair the states' rights panel, the Louisiana Sovereignty Commission; Voelker left the commission {{to run for governor}} in 1963 but polled few votes.|$|E
25|$|Alonso {{started the}} season by {{qualifying}} fifth in Australia; {{by the end}} of the first lap he had moved up to third. He eventually managed to use the pit stops to his advantage by pitting early and jumping Vettel. Alonso held onto second until the end of the race. In Malaysia, Alonso qualified on the second row of the grid in third. Going into the second corner <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>the</b> back of Vettel and damaged his front wing, the team told him to stay out instead of pitting, hoping that the wing would not break, so that Alonso would be able to pit for slick tyres at the right time. However while going down the main straight at the start of the second lap, his front wing broke off and went underneath his car sending it into the gravel trap and into retirement. Alonso then won his home race, the , by fighting through from fifth; however, seventh place in Monaco after that again lost him points and left him 29 points behind Vettel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, Astaire left RKO to {{freelance}} {{and pursue}} new film opportunities, with mixed though generally successful outcomes. Throughout this period, Astaire continued to value {{the input of}} choreographic collaborators and, unlike the 1930s when he worked almost exclusively with Hermes Pan, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>the</b> talents of other choreographers {{in an effort to}} continually innovate. His first post-Ginger dance partner was the redoubtable Eleanor Powell—considered the finest female tap-dancer of her generation—in Broadway Melody of 1940, in which they performed a celebrated extended dance routine to Cole Porter's [...] "Begin the Beguine." [...] In his autobiography Steps in Time, Astaire remarked, [...] "She 'put 'em down like a man,' no ricky-ticky-sissy stuff with Ellie. She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Frieze of Life" [...] themes recur {{throughout}} Munch's {{work but}} he especially focused {{on them in}} the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>the</b> depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or {{as the cause of}} great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).|$|E

5000|$|The film {{starts with}} a bald, obese man in a bright yellow shirt {{preparing}} to eat breakfast, a soft-boiled egg.

[...] As the man continues to tap, it becomes clear the voice {{is coming from the}} egg. <b>The</b> man continues <b>tapping</b> away over <b>the</b> egg's protests, then gets carried away and ends up smashing the egg with his fists, silencing the voice.|$|R

5000|$|A legless beggar {{with a sign}} {{around his}} neck saying [...] "cripple" [...] pushes himself slowly and laboriously on a trolley along the pavement, soliciting alms from {{sympathetic}} passers-by. A policeman gradually approaches from the distance.

The policeman trips over the trolley before recovering his footing and setting off in pursuit.|$|R

At that point, the lights go out, a gong rings, and then everyone assesmbles to determine who did it. It is all intended to be light-hearted fun, except that the corpse is for real.|$|R

50|$|The festival was {{initiated}} in 1910 by the Speyer tourist association {{to promote the}} sales of Speyer breweries, pretzel bakers and cigar factories.

5000|$|The mystical or supernatural often play {{a pivotal}} role in Joyce's works. For this, <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> <b>the</b> mythical or folkloric {{associations}} of his settings. Joyce's treatment of these experiences is what distinguishes his novels from genre fiction. The supernatural is not seen as a conflict or an obstacle to be overcome, but rather an integral part of a natural order that a character must accept and integrate. Running parallel to these phenomena is the possibility of a rational or psychological explanation. This literary approach is influenced in part by Joyce's experiences with his own family: ...|$|R
