5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|Formed as {{a fighter}} wing in November 1943, No.78 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. After the war, it re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs at Williamtown. During the early 1950s, the wing was based at Malta on garrison duties with the Royal Air Force, operating two squadrons of DeHavilland Vampire jet fighters. Re-equipped with CAC Sabres, it deployed with Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons to Malaya in 1958–59, flying sorties against communist insurgents in {{the final years of}} the Emergency. In the 1960s, it was tasked with providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> and supplied the equipment and personnel for the RAAF contingent operating from Ubon Air Base in Thailand. No.78 Wing was disbanded in November 1967, and re-formed for its present role as an operational training wing in February 2000.|$|E
5|$|No.114 MCRU {{deployed}} to Malaya in 1958, becoming operational at RAAF Base Butterworth on 19August. It took over responsibility for aerial surveillance and ground-controlled interception from the Royal Air Force's No.487 Signals Unit on 1December. From Butterworth, No.114 MCRU directed the Sabre fighters of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons and the Canberra bombers of No.2 Squadron {{in the last}} years of the Malayan Emergency. It also sent controllers on attachment to Ubon Air Base in Thailand, where No.79 Squadron was based from 1962. On 3September 1964, the unit went on to a 24-hour operational footing to support the Sidewinder-armed Sabres of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons during the Konfrontasi between <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> though no combat ensued. Konfrontasi having been declared over in August 1966, No.114 MCRU transferred its responsibilities to RAF Western Hill on 22September, and disbanded at Butterworth on 31October.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} least, archaeological {{evidence}} supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants {{were active in}} Southeast Asia, if not the claim of their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius {{have been found in}} Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman glass bowl unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, <b>Indonesia,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era Geography that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the archaeological evidence could have been Oc Eo.

5|$|No.6 Squadron's first F-111Cs {{arrived at}} Amberley on 1 June 1973, and the unit flew its first sorties with the {{aircraft}} on the 13th of the month. The squadron's main role remained {{that of an}} operational conversion unit, though it had a secondary strike role. From August 1979, No.6 Squadron gained a photo reconnaissance role when it was issued with four aircraft which had been modified into RF-111Cs. These four aircraft were concentrated the squadron's Reconnaissance Flight, which included photo analysts as well as specialised aircrew. Training was conducted in Australia and nearby countries, and the RF-111Cs occasionally deployed to the United States {{to take part in}} exercises held there. In June 1982 No.6 Squadron was expanded to include a Survey Flight, which undertook photo survey flights in co-operation with the Army's Royal Australian Survey Corps using a leased Learjet. The flight conducted surveys of south-eastern Australia, northern Australia, Fiji and parts of <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> until it was disbanded on 15 May 1987.|$|E
5|$|On 30January 1961, Headlam {{joined the}} staff of Operational Command (OPCOM), the {{successor}} organisation to Home Command, responsible for the direction of RAAF operational units. He took over as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) OPCOM from Air Vice Marshal Val Hancock in April. Headlam was promoted to air vice marshal on 29May. On 17July 1962, he was posted to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaya, and took up the appointment of AOC No.224 Group RAF in Singapore one week later. He was succeeded as AOC OPCOM by Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch. As AOC No.224 Group, Headlam had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the Brunei Rebellion in December 1962, and the subsequent Konfrontasi between <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> that officially began the following month. Divorced from his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20January 1964. He handed over No.224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris on 30November.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF squadrons {{remained}} at Butterworth {{as part of}} Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No.77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No.79 Squadron at Ubon, Thailand. The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance {{that they were not}} drawn from the Strategic Reserve, thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos.3 and 77Squadrons continued to rotate through No.79 Squadron on a regular basis. The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with Sidewinder missiles, were responsible for regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place. From 26October until 27November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No.77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No.78 Wing in November 1967, No.77 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with CAC Sabres at Williamtown in November 1956. Two {{years later}} it transferred to RAAF Butterworth in Malaya {{to join the}} air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages of the Emergency. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia.</b> It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic jet fighters. No.77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on Diego Garcia in 2001–02, supporting the war in Afghanistan, and deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} military intervention against ISIL in 2015–16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated Pilatus PC-9s in the forward air control role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35 LightningII fighters commencing in 2018, and No.77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia,</b> and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Muslim traders {{from the}} eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of <b>Indonesia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Malaysia</b> in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who {{commanded}} several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430. In the book Yingya Shenglan, his translator Ma Huan documented {{the activities of the}} Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population. Between 1450 and 1520, the Ming Dynasty's interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago. The Portuguese made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century. Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year. Several years later silver began flowing into the region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including the pepper port of Banten.|$|E
