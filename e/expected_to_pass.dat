5|$|Hurricane Ella was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} on record in Canadian waters. It formed on August30, 1978 {{to the south of}} Bermuda, and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. By September1, Ella reached winds of 125mph (205km/h), and it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during the busy Labor Day Weekend. The hurricane became stationary for about 24hours, and later turned to the northeast away from the coast. On September4, Ella reached Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale off the coast of Nova Scotia. It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} the damage {{occurred}} {{on the island of}} Yap. Initially, the typhoon was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September, Maurice {{gave the}} command of the ambush to his {{favourite}} commander, his cousin Philip of Nassau. Maurice instructed him to cross the Lippe river the following day at dawn, hide in a wood next to which the Spanish convoy was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> and fall on its guard. Maurice's goal was to seize the foraging convoy, separate it from the escort and lead it to the Dutch camp, thus forcing Mondragón to intervene with a larger force. Then, after the appearance of Mondragón with the main army, Nassau was to retreat to the Dutch camp, thus luring the Spanish army into an ambush. For his task, Nassau received {{the command of}} some 500 or 700 Dutch and English horsemen and was accompanied by his two brothers, Ernst Casimir and Ludwig Gunther, {{as well as several}} other Dutch officers, Count Ernst of Solms, Paul and Marcellus Bacx, and the English captains Nicholas Parker, Cutler and Robert Vere.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{took over}} issuing {{warnings}} on the hurricane, as Fernanda crossed 140° W into their area of responsibility. After maintaining a west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration, the hurricane turned more toward the west. By August 15, the storm was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii; however, the CPHC noted uncertainty due to an approaching upper-level trough, which would produce a more northerly tack. Its winds weakened to about 85mph (140km/h), although late on August 15 the hurricane re-intensified to winds of 105mph (165km/h). By that time, it had redeveloped a large eye of 50 miles in diameter; wind gusted to 120mph (195km/h), while tropical storm force winds extended 200 miles (640km) from the center. Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to provide observational data while it was near Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast {{to avoid making}} landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours. During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.|$|E

5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E

It was found that a gas station and 30 homes could change states. Lake Wylie Mini Market has been located in South Carolina, along U.S. Route 321, and the move to North Carolina would result in higher gas taxes and change laws on beer and fireworks.

This comprises a medical physics and anatomy examination. Following completion of their part 1 exam, they are then required to pass six written exams (part 2A), which cover all the subspecialities. Successful completion of these allows them to complete the FRCR by completing part 2B, which includes rapid reporting, and a long case discussion.|$|E

25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August, the Expeditionary Force {{continued}} {{falling back}} to the south-west, crossing the River Aisne between Soissons and Compiègne, with a rear guard provided by the brigades of the Cavalry Division. The day's march was cut short by the warm weather, which exhausted the already fatigued infantry, and they halted for the night {{just south of the}} Aisne. The I Corps bivouacked north of the forest around Villers-Cotterêts, with the II Corps to their south-west at Crepy-en-Valois, and the III Corps further to the west around Verberie. This left a gap of around five miles between the II and III Corps, which was filled by the 1st Cavalry Brigade, stationed at the village of Néry. The brigade had spent the day scouting for the German vanguard to the north-west of Compigne, and did not reach its rest area until dusk, around 8.30pm. The British plan for the following day was for a march of ten to fourteen miles southwards to a new defensive line, which called for an early departure from their rest areas; the III Corps rearguards were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through Néry by 6 am, which would already have been vacated by the cavalry. However, most units had reached their overnight stations quite late on the 31st, and so General Pulteney, the corps commander, ordered a later departure.|$|E
