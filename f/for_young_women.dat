5|$|On 5 August 1869, {{shortly after}} The Vicar {{had begun to}} appear in the form of monthly numbers, Dion Boucicault's Formosa; or, The Railroad to Ruin opened at Drury Lane. The title {{character}} of Boucicault's play was a harlot, and her representation on stage provoked an exchange in the pages of The Times. Critics argued that the depiction of a prostitute in the theatre would tarnish the innocence of unmarried girls attending the performance. Supporters, including Boucicault himself, responded that worse women were regularly portrayed in Italian operas such as La traviata and Lucrezia Borgia, which were considered eminently suitable <b>for</b> <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> and in the police and court news of The Times itself.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{accurate}} biographical data, there has been some controversy over the veracity of Marie de Romieu’s authorship of her Discourse over the superiority of women over men, which appeared on her Les Premières Oeuvres Poétiques (1581), as well of the translation Instruction <b>for</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Women</b> (1572). Discourse, published by her brother Jacques de Romieu, has been attributed to Jacques himself by some critics. However, according to French poet Guillaume Colletet, Marie’s style on her Premières Oeuvres is more refined than that of her brother’s, which was “rough and hard” in his own work. In translation of Instruction <b>for</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Women,</b> the only reference to an author refers to the initials M.D.R., which could belong to her, but also to other French authors of the time besides Marie, such as Madeleine des Roches.|$|E
