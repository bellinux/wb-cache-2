5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> {{defeat and}} {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, {{a small part}} of the ice floe broke away and he was only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of the men of the next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

25|$|Because of <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> win in 2000, the Democratic {{turnover}} over of Montana's {{state government}} in 2004, polls in 2006 putting his {{support in the}} state at around 40 percent, and high disapproval ratings from the Jack Abramoff scandal, Burns had been singled out {{as one of the}} most vulnerable senators facing reelection in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In one instance, the pagans {{agreed to}} fell their sacred fir tree, if Martin would stand {{directly}} in its path. He did so, and it miraculously missed him. Sulpicius, a classically educated aristocrat, related this anecdote with dramatic details, {{as a set}} piece. Sulpicius could not have failed to know the incident the Roman poet Horace recalls in several Odes, of <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> escape from a falling tree.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2012 election, Rahall {{defeated}} Republican Rick Snuffer with 53.5% of the vote. [...] His eight-point {{margin of}} victory was <b>his</b> <b>narrowest</b> since 1990.|$|R
50|$|While Reagan {{national}}ly won {{a convincing}} {{victory in the}} electoral college, Massachusetts would be <b>his</b> <b>narrowest</b> win, with the state being about ten percent more Democratic than the national average.|$|R

25|$|Though Gilbert had {{threatened}} legal action, he soon conceded <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> loss. According to Gilbert, the attorney that he consulted said that any appeal {{had to be}} presented by midnight December 20 but more time was needed to prepare for any challenge which {{was likely to be}} successful. Gilbert further indicated that any plan for legal action died when the Webster Parish Democratic Executive Committee certified Batton as the party nominee for sheriff.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Richard {{advanced}} {{his claim}} to the crown by hereditary right in proper form. However, <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> support among his peers led to failure once again. After weeks of negotiation, the best that could be achieved was the Act of Accord, by which York and his heirs were recognised as Henry's successors. However, Parliament did grant York extraordinary executive powers to protect the realm, and made him Prince of Wales (and Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall) and Lord Protector of England on 31 October 1460. With the king effectively in custody, York and Warwick were the de facto rulers of the country.|$|E
25|$|Structured {{around its}} protagonist and named after his main alias, Kir Ianulea recounts how {{one of the}} lesser devils is {{assigned}} the mission of assessing the evil and negativity of women. In order to accomplish this task, he must live {{the life of a}} mortal, and chooses Bucharest as his city of residence. The main part of the story recounts his unhappy marriage to the tyrannical and dishonest Acrivița, his realization that his future among humans was compromised, and <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> escape from his creditors. The third part shows the devil possessing aristocratic young women as part of a scheme to reward his one human benefactor, the peasant Negoiță. The narrative ends with a fall-out between Negoiță and Ianulea, and the latter's hasty return to Hell upon being threatened by a potential reunion with Acrivița.|$|E
60|$|He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered {{over his}} face and looked from <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> eyes, {{made her want to}} hide, to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen.|$|R
50|$|Toh was a {{tenacious}} fighter in {{the battle}} against the Barisan Sosialis party, a splinter group from the PAP. He managed to defeat Barisan chairman Lee Siew Choh by a mere 89 votes in the 1963 Singapore general election, <b>his</b> <b>narrowest</b> electoral victory.|$|R

25|$|In February 1891, Schlieffen was {{appointed}} to the post of Chief of the Großer Generalstab (Great General Staff), the professional head of the Kaiserheer (German Army). The post had lost influence to rival institutions in the German state, because of the machinations of the previous incumbent Alfred von Waldersee (8 April 1832 – 5 March 1904), who had held the post from 1888 to 1891 and had tried to use his position as a political stepping stone. Schlieffen was seen as a safe choice, being junior, anonymous outside the General Staff and with few interests outside the army. Other governing institutions gained power {{at the expense of the}} General Staff and Schlieffen had no following in the army or state. The fragmented and antagonistic character of German state institutions made the development of a grand strategy most difficult, because there was no body to co-ordinate foreign, domestic and war policy. The General Staff planned in a political vacuum and Schlieffen's weak position was exacerbated by <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> military view.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{had made}} no {{political}} bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, who rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know [...] "how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President." [...] Harrison {{was known as the}} Centennial President because his inauguration celebrated the centenary of the first inauguration of George Washington in 1789. In congressional elections, the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats.|$|E
500|$|McCudden {{returned}} to base; {{in spite of}} <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> escape his machine had not been hit. His squadron mates were surprised to see him; they had witnessed his dive, assumed the spin to be terminal, and {{were in the process}} of posting him missing in action. It has been suggested that the enemy pilot was none other than Manfred von Richthofen, [...] "The Red Baron", in which case McCudden had narrowly avoided becoming the rising star's 15th victim. Richthofen was credited with a [...] "two seat Vickers biplane" [...] that afternoon, which has usually been listed as the F.E.2b of Captain Quested and Lieutenant Dicksee, but recent research indicates that the action with McCudden may fit the time frame.|$|E

60|$|There {{under the}} lee of the dry torrent's steeper banks he might crouch, and watch these strange, grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind fell, and it became {{possible}} to escape. And {{there for a long}} time he crouched, watching the strange, grey, ragged masses trail their streamers across <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> sky.|$|R
60|$|Furley nodded. <b>His</b> eyes <b>narrowed,</b> {{and little}} lines {{appeared}} at their corners.|$|R
500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are {{the sleeves of his}} coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> starched white collar.|$|E
500|$|Democrat Jay Inslee {{was elected}} {{governor}} of the state of Washington in 2012. Federally, Spokane is within Washington's 5th congressional district, and has been represented in the House of Representatives by Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers since 2004. Washington State is represented nationally in the Senate by Democrat Patty Murray and Democrat Maria Cantwell. In the 2012 general election, Spokane County favored Mitt Romney for President over Barack Obama by 51.5 to 45.7 percent; on the state ballot, the county supported the legalization of recreational marijuana ballot measure by 52.2 to 47.9 percent and opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage by 44.1 to 55.9 percent. Spokane native Tom Foley was a Democratic Speaker of the House and served as a representative of Washington's 5th district for 30 years, enjoying large support from Spokane, until <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> defeat in the [...] "Republican Revolution" [...] of 1994, the only time U.S. voters have turned out a sitting Speaker of the House since 1860.|$|E
500|$|Manstein's war memoir, Verlorene Siege (Lost Victories), was {{published}} in West Germany in 1955 and translated into English in 1958 for worldwide distribution. The book was a highly acclaimed best-seller, critical of Hitler and his leadership style. Historians such as Liddell Hart saw Manstein's emphasis on the purely military aspects of the war, while ignoring the political and moral aspects, {{as a way for}} him to absolve himself and the high command of any responsibility for the events of the Holocaust. His favourable [...] portrayal of himself influenced popular opinion; he became the centre of a military cult which cast him not only as one of Germany's greatest generals, but also one of the greatest in history. He {{has been described as a}} militärische Kult- und Leitfigur ("military cult figure and leading personality"), a general of legendary — almost mythical — ability, much honoured by both the public and historians. Biographers, including Benoît Lemay, feel that <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> focus on military matters to the exclusion of moral issues cannot be considered ethical.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, Wood was a {{surprise}} entry against First District Representative Bill Alexander in the Democratic Primary. In a campaign managed by Darrell Glascock, the consultant credited for the victory of Tommy Robinson in the Second District two years before, he pushed Alexander to <b>his</b> <b>narrowest</b> win since <b>his</b> election in 1968. Alexander prevailed {{by a vote of}} 81,409 (52.15%) to Wood's 74,701 (47.85%). http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/Historical%20Election%20Results/1986%20Election%20Results.pdf ...|$|R
2500|$|Smith {{swept the}} entire Catholic vote, {{which had been}} split in 1920 and 1924, and brought {{millions}} of Catholics to the polls for the first time, especially women. [...] The fact that Smith was Catholic garnered him support from immigrant populations in New England, which may explain <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> victories in traditionally Republican Massachusetts and Rhode Island, as well as <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> 2% loss in New York (which previous Democratic presidential candidates had lost by double digits).|$|E

2500|$|Considering {{his time}} in the House a [...] "personal failure," [...] Nelson decided not to seek reelection in 1888. Some suspect that <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> escape from a {{drowning}} accident on October 11, 1886 also played a role in increasing his ambition.|$|E
