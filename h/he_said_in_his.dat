5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography {{that there was}} greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players {{to work with and}} was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

The government, he said, needed to clean up Sicily and institute a fair and practical administration.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Schultz stated that {{a series of}} events changed his {{political}} views from the right of the political spectrum to left of the spectrum. One event was his mother's battle with Alzheimer's Disease, which began a long, slow decline of her mental health. Schultz found it frustrating trying to get her the services that she needed. Another was that he met a psychiatric nurse named Wendy who ran a homeless shelter in Fargo, North Dakota. He attributed much of his political change to her. Although he had criticized the homeless on his show, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book that she helped to humanize them and he reportedly found that some of the people he had insulted were veterans, unable to get the psychiatric or medical services that might help them. He says that was the moment he began to look at poverty differently.|$|E
25|$|Simon {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 1990 {{autobiography}} that he was first assigned to the Mounted Beach Patrol at Long Beach Island, off Barnegat, New Jersey, for a year before being sent to boot camp near Baltimore, Maryland, for basic training. Afterward, he reported for duty with the Combat Art Corps in Washington, D.C., part of the Coast Guard Public Information Division. He was stationed there in 1944 when he met New York Post sports columnist Milt Gross, who was with the Coast Guard Public Relations Unit, and the two became roommates in civilian housing. Pursuant to his unit's mission to publicize the Coast Guard, Simon created a true-life Coast Guard comic book that DC agreed to publish, followed by versions syndicated nationally by Parents magazine in Sunday newspaper comics sections, under the title True Comics. This led to his being assigned to create a comic book aimed at driving Coast Guard recruitment. With Gross as his writer collaborator, Simon produced Adventure Is My Career, distributed by Street and Smith Publications for sale at newsstands.|$|E
500|$|Coolidge also wielded {{the veto}} pen as governor. His most publicized veto {{prevented}} {{an increase in}} legislators' pay by 50%. Although Coolidge was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 {{that would have allowed}} the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

500|$|Along with 64 {{other boys}} Cunningham joined the Royal Navy as a cadet aboard the {{training}} ship HMS Britannia in 1897 following preparatory education at Stubbington House School. One {{of his classmates}} was future Admiral of the Fleet James Fownes Somerville. Cunningham {{was known for his}} lack of enthusiasm for field sports, although he did enjoy golf and spent most of his spare time [...] "messing around in boats". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoirs {{that by the end of}} his course he was [...] "anxious to seek adventure at sea". Although he committed numerous minor misdemeanours, he still obtained a very good for conduct. He passed out tenth in April 1898, with first class marks for mathematics and seamanship.|$|E
500|$|The {{perceived}} leniency in {{her sentence}} provoked an uproar in Hong Kong for alleged preferential treatment. In particular, the presiding judge caused outrage when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> judgment that Bokhary had an [...] "unblemished background and {{was born into}} a good family with caring parents [...] an outstanding academic record". The comment highlighted the public perception of widening inequality and increasing disparities in the balance of political power between different social classes in Hong Kong. The judge came under pressure to reconsider his sentencing, but he declined to amend it upon review. Pundits also blamed the police for charging her with an offence carrying a lesser penalty; the Department of Justice was forced to appeal her sentence.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, John Fithian, {{president}} of the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), criticized the dump months (among several other studio practices) at CinemaCon, the annual gathering of film exhibitors hosted by NATO. The theaters had come off a first quarter where receipts had been down 12% from {{the first quarter of}} 2012. He faulted the studios for their insufficiently diverse offerings in 2013 as compared to {{the first quarter of the}} year before, which he connected to the dump-months phenomenon.

500|$|Moore has {{expressed}} dismay that [...] "he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, {{as exemplified by}} Watchmen [...] became a genre". He said in 2003 that [...] "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since Watchmen, {{an awful lot of}} the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use Watchmen to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them". Gibbons said that while readers [...] "were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> view the series was [...] "a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else".|$|E
500|$|Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack {{includes}} {{music by}} the bands Every Time I Die, Chimaira, Suicide Silence, Nitzer Ebb, Mushroomhead, and Lacuna Coil, among others. The soundtrack includes 18 tracks separated by 3 parts, each with six songs and includes 3 bonus tracks. It {{was released on}} October 20, 2009 through Trustkill Records. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic praised the use of hard rock and heavy metal music, something that had been missing since Saw IV. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> review that [...] "It's a fitting marriage, as hard rock and heavy metal are the sonic suitors to horror and torture porn films and video games". He particularly liked the songs by Hatebreed ("In Ashes They Shall Reap"), Converge ("Dark Horse"), My My Misfire ("The Sinatra"), and Kittie ("Cut Throat"), calling the songs the [...] "most ferocious moments this time around".|$|E
500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} as thoroughly as he would have liked. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd rather do it right on the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E

[...] Bassett offered Henderson a five-year {{contract}} worth twice his annual $75,000 salary from the Maple Leafs. [...] The deal included a $50,000 signing bonus and performance bonuses based on how he played in his final year with the Maple Leafs. Henderson signed the contract, though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography that he regretted doing so before completing his term with his NHL club. A bitter opponent of the WHA, Ballard had vowed not to lose more players to the rival league. When he {{found out about the}} deal, he offered Henderson the same contract terms, but without a signing bonus. Upset at how stingy Ballard had been with his teammates, Henderson told Ballard to [...] "take this contract and shove it".

500|$|By late February 1942, the Soviet winter counter-offensive, {{had pushed}} German forces from Moscow {{on a broad}} front and then ended in mutual exhaustion. Stalin was {{convinced}} that the Germans were finished and would collapse by the spring or summer 1942, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> speech of 7 November 1941. Stalin decided to exploit this perceived weakness on the Eastern Front by launching a new offensive in the spring. Stalin's decision faced objections from his advisors, including the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, General Boris Shaposhnikov, and generals Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Georgy Zhukov, who argued for a more defensive strategy. Vasilevsky wrote [...] "Yes, we were hoping for , but the reality was more harsh than that". According to Zhukov, Stalin believed that the Germans were able to carry out operations simultaneously along two strategic axes, he was sure that the opening of spring offensives along the entire front would destabilize the German Army, before it had a chance to initiate what could be a mortal offensive blow on Moscow. Despite the caution urged by his generals, Stalin decided to try to keep the German forces off-balance through [...] "local offensives".|$|E
500|$|Stahlschmidt {{suspected}} that Thomas Hatch was first based in Canterbury, but, from {{late in the}} 16th century, the Hatch family of bellfounders was based at Roses Farm, Broomfield, near Maidstone, where Thomas Hatch may have first taken up residence in 1587. In 1889, W.Scott Robertson noted that the property of Roses Farm straddled {{the boundary between the}} parishes of Broomfield and Ulcombe: in a receipt for work on the bells at Birchington-on-Sea in 1606 Joseph Hatch described himself as [...] "of Bromfeild", and he was buried in the churchyard at Broomfield, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> will of 1639 that he was [...] "of Ulcombe". Stahlschmidt considered it unlikely that the foundry was among the property bequeathed to Joseph Hatch's widow Jane, which included the main dwelling-house of Roses Farm, in Broomfield, and a smaller house adjacent, so it must have lain elsewhere. Bellfounding did not require dedicated buildings, and bells were sometimes cast {{in the vicinity of the}} churches for which they were made, but Stahlschmidt also reported a statement by JamesT.

500|$|A final $11.2 {{million was}} {{allocated}} on January 6, 2005, which was 23.3% of the $48 million Department of Education budget for that fiscal year. On July 15, 2005, {{the school was}} awarded a $60,000 federal fund for energy efficiency 39% below the national energy threshold; this would save the New Brunswick government $115,193 per year, or an eventual $2 million over 20 years. The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is {{good to know that}} our schools can also contribute to protecting our environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after the}} beginning of the 200506 school year. Lord spoke of his government's intention to add schools to the growing number of Francophone institutions in New Brunswick, as well as advancing the state of the province's education. [...] "Today's inauguration represents an historic moment for Moncton's Francophone community," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> speech.

500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E
