40|$|Earthquakes {{produce some}} of the most violent loading {{situations}} that a structure can be subjected to and if a structure fails under these loads then inevitably human life is put at risk. One of the most common methods by which a structure fails under seismic loading is at the connection of structural elements. The research presented in this paper compares the performance of mathematical models of watertowers under seismic conditions. One type of model is assembled withconcrete panels that are connected by means of a novel <b>interlocked</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The performance of this modelwas tested against the performance of a conventional monolith watertower. Two variables were appliedsimultaneously when testing each model: earthquakes with different magnitudes and different mass of the elevated water tanks. The results of this experimental study demonstrated that across all tested seismic conditions, increasing the mass of the water tanks resulted in greater deformation of the watertowers. This was most pronounced for the monolith watertower model. With increasing mass of the water tanks across all seismic conditions, those watertowers composted of interlocked panels withstood increasing loading stresses more effectively than the monolith watertowe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{significant}} factors in design of splice sleeve with composite material. Factors such as position of <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> elastic and inelastic length of sleeve considerably affect bond {{strength of the}} bar coupling system. To assess these vital factors, an experimental study was conducted on thirty-two glass fibers reinforced polymer (GFRP) splice sleeves in tension. The specimens were prepared in eight batches with variation in sleeve length, number of GFRP layers, spliced steel bar diameter, and position of <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The results showed that increasing the confinement pressure in elastic length of sleeve caused reduction in bond strength.

5000|$|This {{incident}} was also attributed to engineering failure. The obsolete Byford Dolphin diving system, dating from 1975, was not equipped with fail-safe hatches, outboard pressure gauges, and an <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{which would have}} prevented the trunk from being opened while the system was under pressure. Prior to the accident, Norske Veritas had issued the following rule for certification: [...] "Connecting mechanisms between bell and chambers are to be so arranged that they cannot be operated when the trunk is pressurized," [...] therefore requiring such systems to have fail-safe seals and <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> One month after the accident, Norske Veritas and the Norwegian oil directorate made the rule final for all bell systems.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The stress {{transfer}} {{mechanism in}} uniaxially and biaxially stretched polymeric geogrids are largely {{dependent on the}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism</b> between the soil and reinforcement. Over the years, this mechanism which may be termed the static <b>interlock</b> <b>mechanism,</b> has been researched and gained wide recognition. When pre-stretched polymeric geogrids are subjected to repeated loading cycles such as compac-tion forces, a second mechanism which may be termed the dynamic interlock mecha-nism is developed. In this paper, {{the existence of this}} mechanism is established through a series of in-air and in-soil static and dynamic tensile load tests using uniaxially pre-stretched HDPE geogrid specimens. The series of tests also identifies the importance of proper positioning of strain measuring instruments along reinforcements used in re...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} to decompose a 3 D digital shape into a set of interlocking pieces {{that are easy to}} be manufactured and assembled. The pieces are designed {{so that they can be}} represented as a simple height field and, therefore, they can be manufactured by common 3 D printers without the usage of supporting material. The removal of the supporting material is often a burdensome task and may eventually damage the surface of the printed object. Our approach makes the final reproduction cheaper, accurate and suitable for the reproduction of tangible cultural heritages. Moreover, since the proposed technique decomposes the artwork in pieces, it also overcomes the working space limits of common printers. The decomposition of the input (high-resolution) triangular mesh is driven by a coarse polygonal base mesh (representing the target subdivision in pieces); the height fields defining each piece are generated by sampling distances along the normal of each face composing the base mesh. A innovative <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows adjacent pieces to plug each other to compose the final shape. This <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed to preserve the height field property of the pieces and to provide a sufficient degree of grip to ensure the assembled structure shape to be compact and stable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show its limitations with some practical reproduction examples. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the three-dimensional <b>interlocking</b> professional management <b>mechanism</b> of agricultural family-owned enterprise was studied through the following three mechanisms; the stimulation and restriction mechanism within the agricultural family-owned enterprises, the credit mechanism of professional manager and the social environment mechanism. The relationship between the agricultural family-owned enterprise, professional manager and the society was studied. In the first place, {{the relationship between the}} agricultural family-owned enterprise and the professional manager belongs to the principal-agent relations, which means that the family-owned enterprise entrusts the professional manager with the operational rights and the professional managers try to preserve and increase the value of the enterprise with his knowledge and competence. In the second place, the family-owned enterprise must obey social norm and accept social supervision. In the third place, the professional manager is the outcome of social economy, so his existence and development are affected by several social factors.

Fiber Metal laminates, FML, is a {{combination}} of metal with fiber/resin laminates and it is a well-known application in composite laminates due to its dimension stability and properties consistency. Generally, the strength of these laminates systems is much depends on the mechanical <b>interlocking</b> <b>mechanism</b> between the metal surface and the composite laminates. Therefore, surface treatment is needed to enhance the laminates strength. In this research, aluminum plates with different surface roughness were laminated with carbon-fiber/epoxy laminates. The strength of these hybrid systems was then characterized to study the effect of surface roughness on the interfacial strength. It shows that the higher surface roughness will result in better interfacial interaction between the metal surface and the fiber laminates...|$|R
