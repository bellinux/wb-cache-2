50|$|The type of tank used to melt solder and tar is very {{different}} from one that is used to melt waxes, especially organic waxes such as soy, for making scented and colored candles. For example, tanks used for adhesives may need to heat up to 500degrees(°) Fahrenheit(F), while an organic soy wax will be ruined at over 140°F and should never be heated above 200°F. A delicate soy wax used to make candles would be burned and destroyed if not heated in an even, lower temperature than solder or tar. Also, since soaps and candles are scented and colored, the tanks designed for melting these substances need to be specially polished so there is no cross-contamination between different scents of candles or soaps. Based on this challenge, there are melting tanks that are specially coated for candle wax melting, while some have created specially <b>coated</b> <b>tanks</b> for soap making. Obviously, tar and solder makers care very little about the scent of their product, whereas fragrance is probably the most important determinant of purchasing a candle or soap.|$|R

The characteristic feature of this device {{is the ability to}} obtain one-sided radar soundings/images with a high sensitivity and high resolution (2 cm) in the frequency band of 3. 6 – 4. 0 GHz. One promising application of the device is non-destructive evaluation of the heat protection system and other materials on the U. S. Space Shuttle, and proposed crewed exploration vehicle (CEV). The advantages of this continuous-wave holographic radar over traditional impulse subsurface radars are discussed and illustrated by experimental results. The disastrous loss of the space shuttle Columbia, as well as even more recent dangerous incidents that were thankfully resolved, have aroused interest in possible new methods and devices for non-destructive testing and evaluation of the Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System, the external fuel tank insulating foam, and other materials and structures on the shuttle (see Figure 1), proposed CEV, and other space vehicles. Voids in or under the external tank insulating foam are considered potential sites for “cryopumping ” where water seeps in and then evaporates explosively at altitude, pulling the foam from the tank (Figure 2). One of the possible means for non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation of structural ma-terials is subsurface radar.

40|$|Industrialized {{society is}} linked to the {{transport}} of hazardous materials by road and rail, among other. During transportation, accidents may occur and propagate among the tankers leading to severe fires, explosion or toxic dispersions. This may increase the level of individual and social risk associated to those activities, since the transport network often crosses densely populated area. The escalation of a primary event, in this case the fire, is typically denoted as domino effect, and the triggered secondary events typically are amplified. In the framework of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, severe fire and explosion hazards are associated to the possible catastrophic rupture of tankers, which may be induced by domino effect of accidental fires. Heat resistant coatings may protected tankers against the fire, reducing the heat load that reaches the tank shell wall and the lading. Indeed, the rupture {{is the result of the}} double effect of thermal weakening of the tank material and the increasing pressure due to LPG evaporation. However, this protection systems are not ideal and undergo defects due to both material degradation and accidental damage. Therefore, protection may be ineffective. The present work is aimed at characterizing the performance of defective coatings. The first part of the work is devoted to the characterization of past accidents occurred in the framework of road and rail transportation of hazardous materials. The ARIA and MHIDAS databases are adopted as data sources, identifying 245 road and 220 rail accidents involving hazardous materials. The analysis highlighted the importance of protecting tank from heat load to avoid the rupture and related severe scenario. For these reasons, in North America the installation of a heat resistant coating is used to protect dangerous good tankers from accidental fire exposure. In Europe, ADR and RID regulations govern transnational transport of hazardous materials by road and by rail, respectively, and still not include any section about thermal protection systems of tankers. Possible concerns related to the installation of these systems is due presence of defects that may be formed accidentally in the fireproofing layer. It is therefore important to establish what level of defect is acceptable in order to avoid the failure of tankers, in the prospective of a wider implementation of tankers fire protections in the European framework. Since large scale bonfire tests are expensive and difficult to be carried out in order to verify the thermal protections adopted, modelling the behaviour of pressurized insulated tankers when exposed to the fire is a possible solution to test the adequateness of defective protections. In order to describe the thermal behaviour of real scale LPG tanks exposed to fire, a lumped model (namely, ‘RADMOD’) and a Finite Elements Model (FEM) are developed. The models are validated against available experimental data and allow predicting the thermal behaviour of tankers with defective coating when exposed to fire, with the aim to assess the thermal protection performance. The phenomena taking place through the vessel in presence of defects are investigated and characterized, in order to reproduce the experimental data on thermal behaviour of defective thermal protection systems exposed to fire. The FEM model allows to determine the wall temperature profile and the stress distribution over the vessel, determining, in the end, a critical defect size that lead to the tank failure, with respect different fire conditions. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the FEM model in order to identify the parameters that mostly affect the heat exchanges of the system. This analysis highlights the main relevance of the flame temperature against other parameters, such as convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity of flame and steel. The complex analysis performed by FEM model, requires high computational times, which may be prohibitive when a wide number of runs is required. The RADMOD code is a simplified lumped model, which allows to assess the behaviour, among other, of the pressure and the fluid temperature with lower, and thus acceptable, computational time. Another plus of the RADMOD model is that it can be run for a wide range of materials, substances, geometries and fire scenario, estimating a conservative but credible time to failure of the tank. The novel mathematical code for defective thermal protection system is added to the previous version of the RADMOD model, which was implemented for unprotected or completely <b>coated</b> <b>tanks,</b> thus all the phenomena related to the defect enclosure are characterised. In addition, other phenomena, already present in the RADMOD model, are revised to enhance the potentiality of the code. The comparison of results with available experimental data on medium-scale shows that the model proposed in this thesis work can reasonably predict the thermal response. The application of the modelling tool to different geometries is performed considering real-scale defects. Thus, several case-studies were defined in order to reproduce medium- and large-scale tanks varying a few parameters, such as defect size and liquid filling level, for testing the reproducibility of the new model. The results from the case studies highlight the potentiality and the flexibility of the RADMOD code in modelling the thermal response. The ultimate goal would be to apply the data collected from RADMOD code about temperature and pressure of lading, as boundary condition in the FEM model for an improved modelling of thermal behaviour of real-scale LPG tanks in fire scenarios even if there is a defective thermal protection system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper addresses the biodegradation process for ballast tank coatings in marine environments. As {{part of this}} new approach, a commercially available ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> was exposed to bacteria obtained from a culture collection and to a natural bacterial community isolated from a real ballast tank. The natural community was chosen to explore the interaction of natural biofilms with the coating, an aspect, which is not covered in standard procedures. It is shown that biological activity significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and holes have been identified using AFM. Acidic bacteria generated holes with 0. 2 - 0. 9 μm in depth and 4 - 9 μm in width. Whereas the natural community additionally caused cracks of 2 - 8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The overall effect of this degradation was examined using the EIS technique. However, the bacterial affected coatings (exposed to acid producing bacteria and a natural community) show a decrease in corrosion resistance. Impedance IZI values decreased over time from 1. 18 × 109 to 1. 87 × 107 Ω for acidic bacteria and from 1. 71 × 109 to 2. 24 × 107 Ω for the natural community, indicating a clear loss in coating resistance over time. It is also revealed that the coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure for the natural community, leading {{to the formation of}} blisters. Bacterial settling could be linked to some specific biofilm patterns affecting different types of coating attack. It can be concluded {{that it is necessary to}} include natural communities in coating degradation studies to identify possible degradation mechanisms and the severity of the attack over time. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that ageing steel marine {{structures}} are susceptible to corrosion in its all manifestations. The most critical areas are cargo and ballast tanks of merchant ships. However, due to the regulations such as the Performance Standard for Protective Coatings, which requires a 15 -year target life of <b>coating</b> in ballast <b>tanks,</b> plus the cathodic protection systems, the internal structures within cargo holds have become more problematic but poorly studied. In the underdeck area and bottom plating, the structures are not normally fully protected. Also, the complex structural arrangement may place difficulties in inspection and repair. In extreme cases, {{it has been reported that}} the corrosion rate in these areas could be 5 to 7 times higher than a normal value, and has led to catastrophic structural failures. Currently, the classification societies apply both visual and gauging methods for corrosion inspection during ship surveys. However, it is time consuming especially for large vessels and is highly experience dependent. Therefore, to improve the survey efficiency, facilitate economical maintenance decisions, and even extend the structural life, it is essential to investigate the ultimate strength of such aged and corroded steel structures. Based on the identification of existing corrosion issues in cargo tanks of oil tankers and bulk carriers and the state-of-art of corroded marine structural strength assessments, a nonlinear finite element method was adopted to investigate the influences of pitting and grooving corrosion on the structural integrity. Two full-field experimental techniques were used for a complete validation of the numerical models. Based on the repair conditions provided by classification societies, the numerical results showed that 25 % locally corroded area of a plate (800 mm × 800 mm × 15 mm) with 3. 75 mm remaining thickness may reduce the ultimate strength by up to 20 % compared to a uniformly corroded plate. The weld-induced grooving corrosion of a width of 59 mm and a remaining thickness of 3. 75 mm would cause up to 26 % strength capacity reduction for a stiffened plate (4750 mm × 950 mm × 15 mm). Moreover, it was shown that the corrosion depth had a greater influence on structural performance compared to corrosion area for the same volume/material loss. By combining mechano-electrochemical protocols with the stress and strain results obtained from the modelling, it enables predictions of the ‘hot spot’ locations of mechanically-induced corrosion acceleration. Results showed that the anodic current density inside grooving corrosion damage (24 mm in width and 3. 75 mm in depth) was 7 times greater vis-a-vis the unstressed condition for the stiffened plate at its ultimate strength state. The results, which are closely related to the industrial corrosion inspection and repair requirement, will not only benefit the shipping industry, but are also applicable to a whole range of marine structures (offshore platforms and steel bridges) ...|$|R
40|$|Failure of {{ballast tank}} {{coatings}} {{is an increasing}} problem in today’s shipping industry. The consequences of coating failures (fracture) are corrosion of the steel {{which can lead to}} early occurrence of fatigue cracks and fast fatigue crack propagation. Inspections of coatings in water ballast tanks of ships have shown that fracture of many coatings occurs earlier than their design life (which is around 8 - 12 years), although the coatings have been maintained regularly and properly. From a financial perspective, maintenance and repair of a coating is very expensive (810 million USD for the US marine shipping industry in 2006) and should be reduced. This can be achieved by better methods that can assist in the identification of critical locations in water ballast <b>tanks</b> regarding <b>coating</b> failure. With such a method, the preparation for maintenance and repair procedures can be made more efficiently. The aim of this thesis is to suggest a method (simulation procedure) which can be used to identify local areas inside a ballast <b>tank</b> where <b>coating</b> fracture may occur as a result of large strains and ageing of the coating’s mechanical properties. The methodology proposed is to use a finite element sub-modelling technique that involves full ship analysis to find local areas which thereafter are refined to better represent ballast tank areas and locations with high strain levels. These areas are then modelled into more detailed local models in order to perform non-linear finite element analyses where the ship steel is allowed to exceed its yield stress in e. g. cut-outs. Fracture of a coating is assumed to occur when the strain level of the ship steel exceeds the fracture strain of the aged coating. Different sea state conditions are simulated where the significant wave height, the wave heading angle and the ship’s speed are varied. Six different local areas are studied in detail with regard to the strain response of the steel (substrate). The computed strains in the substrate are compared against fracture strains of un-aged and aged water ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> samples from uniaxial tensile tests. The results show that the strain in the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of aged coatings in several locations, i. e. the coating will fracture. The most critical areas and locations of the case study vessel are {{at the bottom of the}} ballast tank, in the cut-outs that intersect a longitudinal stiffener and a transverse web frame. It is concluded that the method proposed is suitable for finding local areas where the strain of the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of the coating. It is also concluded that high mesh density in local details is necessary in this method in order to carry out realistic simulations and resolve the strain gradients in cut-out details and thereby be able to compare strains in the substrate with coating fracture strains...|$|R
40|$|Microbiologically {{influenced}} corrosion (MIC) {{is known}} to be a dangerous process in ship tanks due to its rapid and yet unpredictable occurrence, leading to extremely fast local corrosion, possibly jeopardizing the structural integrity, in a relatively short time. This project focuses on a fundamental understanding of MIC processes in ship ballast tanks (SBTs) as a basis for the development of effective counterstrategies that offer an appropriate protection against MIC attack. Local conditions typically consist of oxic-anoxic environments where both aerobic and anaerobic biofilms develop resulting in aggressive corrosion. Fundamental understanding of the dominant parameters considering material, environment and microbes were addressed. In chapter 1 a review of the conditions in ship ballast tanks, possible MIC mechanisms and practical counterstrategies is presented. Chapter two deals with the impact of MIC in a real scale SBT to understand community characteristics within SBTs. The study highlights the impact of attached biofilms on local corrosion in a ship ballast tank environment. The application of molecular techniques in combination with electrochemical techniques provides a better and synergistic monitoring tool in the enclosed seawater environment. The work in this chapter provides a systematic future research and analysis approach to build up a database of bacterial species, which are involved in corrosion or coating degradation on-board of ships. A more effective treatment system for treating biofilms on sidewalls of ship ballast tanks will help to reduce costly material replacements. In chapter three the usability of electrochemical techniques for monitoring MIC is discussed in detail. Three individual approaches were studied in the lab comprising: (i) corrosion impact of a dual species biofilm, (ii) implementation of a simulated ship tank model system and (iii) the study of the biodeterioration of a ship ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating.</b> The fourth chapter comprises different highly sensitive and spatially resolved techniques to study MIC on a very local scale. The first step included the development of a novel analysis approach for the preparation and visualization of metal surfaces, suitable for combined imaging by epifluorescent microscopy (EFM), AFM and SEM. By combining three different microscopes, the complementary use of these high-resolution techniques to study surface changes and accumulation of biological substances on stainless steel surfaces was proven. The last experimental part of the thesis covers the use of local electrochemical techniques. The scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) and scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) were used for their high spatial resolution close to the metal/solution interface. By combing these techniques in-situ changes at metal/solution interfaces in the presence and absence of aerobic bacteria could be followed up. Therefore it was possible to demonstrate that the application of local scanning electrochemical techniques with high-spatial resolution is a powerful tool for a better understanding of microbial activity on metal systems providing in-situ information of the processes taking place at the metal/biofilm/solution interface. Chapter five summarises the conclusions drawn in the preceding chapters. In addition, the general discussion in this chapter links together some of the preceding results and suggestions. The last part of the thesis gives a future outlook on MIC monitoring and prediction and reviews options to mitigate MIC failures based on a multidimensional approach.

40|$|To asses the {{navigability}} in muddy navigation {{areas the}} nautical bottom concept was introduced, {{according to the}} International Navigation Association: The nautical bottom is the level where physical characteristics of the bottom reach a critical limit beyond which contact with a ship’s keel causes either damage or unacceptable effects on controllability and manoeuvrability. The nautical bottom is mostly determined based on a density value as critical limit. The choice of the critical parameter is merely based upon the feasibility to continuously monitor the density of a mud layer, however, {{it is only a}} surrogate for the so-called rheological transition. Moreover, according to the nautical bottom criterion knowledge on ship behaviour in muddy areas is also needed. Experimental research A common practice to gather knowledge on ship behaviour is the execution of model tests. One of the major problems when a mud layer is involved is the search for an accurate model for the mud behaviour. Mud behaves rather complexly and is subjected to time dependence. Furthermore its characteristics vary with the depth. The model tests that have been carried out mostly use an artificial mud layer. Because of the time dependence of the mud layer it is difficult or even impossible to repeat several tests under the same natural mud conditions. In most cases an artificial mud layer was used having a constant density and viscosity in function of the depth. One research institute, SOGREAH (1989), included a gradient for the density. The early research programs were however limited in time or technology. MARIN (1976) only carried out some captive manoeuvring runs, while Flanders Hydraulics Research (1984 - 1989) did not even have a towing tank. Those three research institutes were the only ones that performed experimental research on muddy navigation conditions. Hence, the results of these programs cannot be generalized, however some common interesting observations were made such as the occurrence of undulations of the water-mud interface and the drop in the speed-propeller rate characteristic, which can be ascribed to the decreased propeller efficiency due to the undulations that disturb the inflow of the propeller. An additional problem in the execution of model tests are the scaling effects. Froude’s law is commonly chosen to scale ship models. In this case both model and full scale density are equal. A scaling correction is determined for the ship resistance according to the ITTC 1978 recommendations. To take the effect of the mud layer into account a weighted Reynolds number has been used, based on the amount of wetted hull surface in contact with the mud layer. Other methods are also possible, such as: • The determination of a weighted frictional resistance coefficient based on the amount of wetted hull surface in contact with the mud layer. This however yields larger reductions in case of low density mud layers; • The determination of the resistance coefficient based on the vertical velocity distribution in water and mud layer. The experimental research can be supported by theoretical calculations which show that a shallow water approach can be used to model the effect of a mud layer. Because of the limited character of the research programs carried out in the past, a new research program was initiated, consisting of captive manoeuvring tests in Flanders Hydraulics Research shallow water tank and both fast- and real-time simulation runs. The mud layer was simulated with a mixture of chlorinated paraffins and petroleum. A wide range of viscosities and densities has been tested covering the typical mud viscosities and densities in the harbour of Zeebrugge. The artificial mud layer was however chemical aggressive so that a special <b>coating</b> in the <b>tank</b> was needed. Tests were carried out with three ship models: a model of a 6000 TEU container carrier, a 8000 TEU container carrier and a bulk carrier. Most runs were carried out with th...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringDuring {{the last}} decades {{there have been several}} major ship accidents, and it is {{believed}} that old ships are more unsafe than newer ships. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon the thesis is investigating different issues with ship ageing. This thesis consists of a general description of the most important ageing issues, and the condition of sea water ballast tanks is identified {{as one of the most}} critical issue regarded to ageing on LPG-tankers. This investigation consists of a theoretical description and evaluation of different corrosion mechanisms, fatigue, buckling and steel protection. The different rules and regulation for new build, maintenance and inspection of ballast tanks are discussed, and there have been physical inspections of some ballast tanks on some selected ships (25, 15 and 1 year old ships). A high number of ballast tanks inspection report are reviewed and used as a basis for the conclusions. To demonstrate the importance of proper steel protection, a life time evaluation of critical areas in ballast tanks are carried out. There are five different ageing issues concerning a gas-tanker, seen through a shipping company, as listed below 	Functional ageing 	Technological ageing 	Knowledge based ageing 	Organizational ageing 	Commercial ageing Market related Every one of the ageing mechanisms can affect the lifetime of the ship in different ways. Commercial ageing can be the most fixed ageing mechanism, where the charterer sets a maximum age on ships they will charter. The major oil and gas companies have a maximum age on gas-tankers to be 20 – 25 years old, regardless of the actual condition of the ship. Most of the oil and gas companies require the ships to be in better condition than minimum class requirement, and require ships older than 15 years old to have a Condition Assessment Program – CAP rating of 1 or 2, where CAP 1 is very good condition, CAP 3 is class limit, and CAP 4 is below class limit. Concerning functional ageing, the sea water ballast tanks are a weak link. The ballast tanks have a very corrosive environment with sea water when filled and a humid salty environment when empty. There are (from 2006) strict requirements for <b>coating</b> in ballast <b>tanks</b> called Performance Standard for Protective Coating – PSPC, in addition cathodic protection can be used. This study shows that the top of the wing ballast tanks are the most critical area concerning heavy corrosion in case of coating breakdown. This due to: 	Good supply of oxygen in ballast condition because the tank will in most cases not be filled to the top, and therefore no protection from the offer anodes. 	Moist and salty environment with good supply of oxygen in loaded condition (empty for water) I. e. the cathodic protection is not effective. Rules and regulations require the ship owner to have maintenance and inspection routines of all the important parts of the ship. In Solvang the chief officer inspects all the ballast tanks every 6 th months. The ballast tank inspections that are reviewed show a varying degree of corrosion on the different ships. The maintenance procedures have been updated lately due to problems with coating breakdown shortly after coating maintenance. From the review of the ballast tank condition it seems clear that often the identified corrosion was left unrepaired. The best practice would be to maintain the corrosion spot right away, and prevent the corrosion to expand. If not, the coating will demand more extensive maintenance later. The reasons for postponement of maintenance in ballast tanks can be many. With regard to all the ship accidents that have happened the last 50 years, very few of them are directly caused by ageing mechanisms such as corrosion and fatigue. After MV Flare, MV Erika and MV Prestige which sank in 1998, 1999 and 2002 respectively, there have not (known to the undersigned) been any major ship disasters caused by ageing mechanisms. There have been other accidents such as groundings, collisions and collapse of hull due to bad design, but that type of accidents is not of interest in this thesis. The few accidents in the later years indicates that the rules and requirement regulating the shipping industry (IMO, IACS, class societies, flag state, port control, vetting. etc.) are showing a real effect on the accident rate concerning ageing mechanisms. MV Flare was a bulk carrier, and MV Erika and MV Prestige were oil tankers which sank due to ageing mechanisms. No liquefied gas tankers are known (to undersigned) to sink due to ageing mechanisms. This means that the assumption that an older LPG-tanker may be more unsafe due to ageing not is the case. It is not the age, but the overall condition that decides if the ship is unsafe or not. To evaluate the effect of coating breakdown in ballast tanks some simplified evaluations for buckling capacity and fatigue life were carried out. With localized corrosion that often appears in ballast tanks, the results found showed that the local buckling capacity may be reduced severely in a relatively short period of time. (~ 5 years) Two different approaches for calculating the fatigue life have been used. The calculations show that the approach for offshore structures give approximately 50 % of the fatigue life compared to the ship rules, in corrosive environment. Both methods show that the fatigue life reduces drastically with coating breakdown...|$|R
