5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for <b>her</b> <b>silence</b> – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud {{states that}} there are three methods of {{performing}} erusin; by handing the woman a coin or object of nominal value, by handing her a document and through consummation (sexual intercourse), although the last is prohibited by the Talmud.

25|$|In 2004, the Coen {{brothers}} made The Ladykillers, {{a remake}} of the Ealing Studios classic. A professor, played by Tom Hanks, assembles a team to rob a casino. They rent a room in an elderly woman's home to plan the heist. When the woman discovers the plot, the gang decides to murder her to ensure <b>her</b> <b>silence.</b> The Coens received {{some of the most}} lukewarm reviews of their careers in response to this film.|$|E
25|$|Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for <b>her</b> <b>silence</b> on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later {{repeated}} {{during the}} 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her perceived {{indifference to the}} plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar’s persecuted Muslim minority. In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens. In a 2013 interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to ethnic cleansing, insisting that the tensions were due to a “climate of fear” caused by “a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is ‘very great’.” She did condemn “hate of any kind” in the interview. According to Peter Popham, {{in the aftermath of the}} interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim. Husain had challenged Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Suu Kyi’s claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain.|$|E

25|$|During 1985, Den and Angie {{celebrate}} their seventeenth wedding anniversary {{but it soon}} becomes clear that their marriage is a sham. Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, {{there is not much}} of a relationship going on. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie is all too aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie does what she always does in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe her daughter to ensure <b>her</b> <b>silence,</b> and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday, Angie calls off the affair, but it isn't long before Sharon gives Den the impression that her mother has been up to no good. Den confronts Angie, and she admits to the affair, but unfortunately for her, Den isn't concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.|$|E
500|$|By 1570, senior {{figures in}} the {{government}} privately accepted that Elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. For her failure to marry, Elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. <b>Her</b> <b>silence,</b> however, strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; she remembered that the way [...] "a second person, as I have been" [...] had been used {{as the focus of}} plots against her predecessor.|$|E

500|$|According to a National Geographic article, {{the novel}} is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because [...] "she abhors {{anything}} that trades on the book's fame". To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum. David Lister in The Independent states that Lee's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and <b>her</b> <b>silence</b> [...] "makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart". Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them [...] "Mockingbird groupies", and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic [...] "Hell, no!" ...|$|E
500|$|Based on {{a review}} of CCTV footage, the {{programme}} purports {{to demonstrate that the}} self-immolators donned fire-proof clothing and masks, and raises the question of why the participants' hair and the apparently gasoline-filled bottles they carried did not catch fire. Falun Gong sources also noted that the self-immolators' behaviour, the slogans they shouted, and their meditation postures were not consistent with the teachings or practices of Falun Gong. Furthermore, the program's frame-by-frame analysis of the CCTV footage purportedly shows that Liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to the head from a man in a military overcoat. The False Fire documentary described the death of 12-year-old Liu Siying as being under [...] "unusual circumstances", saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 March. Some Falun Gong sources argue that she may have been killed by the government as a way of guaranteeing <b>her</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ciara's {{previous}} two albums, Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010), both underperformed commercially {{compared to the}} singer's first two albums; [...] (2006) debuted at number one, while her debut album, Goodies (2004), debuted at number three. Following a heavy period of legal issues and unauthorized leaking of songs from the Fantasy Ride recording sessions, Ciara recorded Basic Instinct in strict confidentiality. Ciara reflected on the album's progress at the time, stating that she wasn't interested in first week sales or performance. However, Gerrick Kennedy from the Los Angeles Times attributed Basic Instincts lack of success to multiple pushbacks and the leaking of material from the album's recording sessions. Eventually, Ciara broke <b>her</b> <b>silence</b> revealing that Jive Records had not financially supported her with Fantasy Ride and Basic Instinct. Ciara was left to pay for promotion herself, which included funding the music video and radio release of her last single [...] "Gimmie Dat". She publicly asked {{to be released from}} Jive on February 14, 2011.|$|E

Badland said that Babe is [...] "quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips them into her pocket to use against people!" [...] The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for <b>her</b> <b>silence.</b> Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that [...] "Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money.

Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation. Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon's 1987 book, [...] She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape-recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard. It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta.

She stated that she was [...] "not interested in revenge; I'm interested in the truth" ...|$|E
