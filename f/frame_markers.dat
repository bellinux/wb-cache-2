40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} rhetorical moves, metadiscourse types and resources used {{to accompany the}} moves in English abstract section of undergraduate students’ (thesis) article at STKIP PGRI Jombang. Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of <b>frame</b> <b>markers)</b> characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of <b>frame</b> <b>markers</b> sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeSkin marker-based {{systems are}} used to {{accurately}} measure the three-dimensional motion of the temporomandibular joint. Since skin markers move relative to the underlying bone during jaw movements, the measured temporomandibular joint kinematics is subject to soft-tissue artifacts. A complete evaluation of soft-tissue artifacts for markers on the facial anatomical landmarks and on an optical frame during jaw opening/closing movements is not available. The {{purpose of this study}} was to further our knowledge using a commercial opto-electronic movement tracking system to measure marker movements, that were then compared to true values defined by a transoral rigid device attached to the incisors. Materials and methodsTwenty healthy subjects performed jaw opening/closing movements at a self-selected pace while the 3 D trajectories of 17 facial skin markers, three markers on an optical frame, and 4 markers on a transoral device were measured using a six-camera opto-electronic motion tracking system. Movements of the skin and optical <b>frame</b> <b>markers</b> relative to the head coordinate system defined by the transoral device (gold standard) were calculated. The movements of the head coordinate systems defined using different groups of skin markers relative to the gold standard were also analyzed. ResultsThe results showed that nose-bridge markers had minimal displacements but the middle- and side-face markers had large displacements. ConclusionsIt appears that markers on the frontal nose bridge are good alternatives to transoral rigid devices for measuring mandibular motion, compared to optical <b>frame</b> <b>markers</b> and other skin markers on the face. The results of the current study will be helpful for establishing guidelines for marker placement when measuring mandibular movements in patients with potential temporomandibular disorders...|$|E

Dissatisfaction with the current methods of teaching English and awareness of {{the positive effect of}} strategy training has led teachers in Iran to adopt holistic approaches to text processing. Of equal concern is to make students metacognitively aware of strategies and techniques that promote reading comprehension in terms of the macro level characteristics of the text. Text structure knowledge has been recognized as an efficient strategy that enhances reading comprehension. To this end, 85 Iranian EFL learners were provided with instruction on discourse structuring signals (transitional words, <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> endophoric markers, code glosses, and punctuation marks) during one semester.

This tool was conceived specifically for children, applying design techniques to determinate the best shape, material and typography for young students. The content is displayed by projectors, which exhibit the required information only on the blocks surface using an automatic projector calibration technique. The blocks are tracked through a <b>frame</b> <b>marker</b> using the moving edges approach with multiple hypotheses to improve robustness. ARBlocks was evaluated from three different perspectives: computational, educational and user experience. Technical results show that the platform achieves a real time frame rate and an accurate projector calibration, as well as precisely displays information over the blocks. Additionally, in the educational evaluation the teachers interviewed asserted that the ARBlocks has a great potential and can be a very useful tool to be used in classrooms. Regarding the user experience, both teachers and children were excited in using this system continuously. Keywords—augmented reality; education; tangible user interface; design for children I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} recognize 6 DOF rigid body motion trajectories (3 D translation + rotation), such as the 6 DOF motion trajectory of an object manipulated by a human. As {{a first step in}} the recognition process, 3 D measured position trajectories of arbitrary and uncalibrated points attached to the rigid body are transformed to an invariant, coordinate-free representation of the rigid body motion trajectory. This invariant representation is independent of the reference frame in which the motion is observed, the chosen marker positions, the linear scale (magnitude) of the motion, the time scale and the velocity profile along the trajectory. Two classification algorithms which use the invariant representation as input are developed and tested experimentally: one approach based on a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, and one based on Hidden Markov Models. Both approaches yield high recognition rates (up to 95 % and 91 %, respectively). The advantage of the invariant approach is that motion trajectories observed in different contexts (with different reference <b>frames,</b> <b>marker</b> positions, time scales, linear scales, velocity profiles) can be compared and averaged, which allows us to build models from multiple demonstrations observed in different contexts, and use these models to recognize similar motion trajectories in still different contexts.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} a novel method for simultaneous intrafraction tracking of multiple fiducial markers. Although the proposed method is generic {{and can be}} adopted {{for a number of}} applications including fluoroscopy based patient position monitoring and gated radiotherapy, the tracking results presented in this paper are specific to tracking fiducial markers in a sequence of cone beam CT projection images. Methods: The proposed method is accurate and robust thanks to utilizing the mean shift and random sampling principles, respectively. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated with qualitative and quantitative methods, using data from two pancreatic and one prostate cancer patients and a moving phantom. The ground truth, for quantitative evaluation, was calculated based on manual tracking preformed by three observers. Results: The average dispersion of marker position error calculated from the tracking results for pancreas data (six markers tracked over 640 <b>frames,</b> 3840 <b>marker</b> identifications) was 0. 25 mm (at iscoenter), compared with an average dispersion for the manual ground truth estimated at 0. 22 mm.

40|$|Ph. D. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) In {{the ideal}} {{communication}} system no noise is present and error free communication is possible. In practice, however, several factors influence the correctness of· the communication. One {{of the most}} important of these factors is the synchronization of the message. Synchronization techniques form an integral part of data communication systems and without synchronization no comprehensible message can be received. An example of a communication system in which synchronization errors occur is the plesiochronous communication network which is used in many telephone networks [49, 50]. A common problem with the use of the multiplexers in such a network is that output pulses may occur that do not contain valid data, due to minor discrepancies in the clock frequencies of the incoming signals. These inserted bits are termed ''justification bits" and their presence is signaled over the link by the justification control bits or stuffing control bits, which are included in the frame [49 and 50]. Synchronization of the network is dependent, among other factors, on the correct decoding of the stuffing control bits.

This study's aim was to accurately determine in a large finger sample the kinematics and variability of the coupled interphalangeal joint motions, for potential clinical and finger model validation applications. The data could also be applied to humanoid robotic hands. Sixty-eight fingers were measured in seventeen hands in nine subjects. Fingers exhibited great joint mobility variability, with passive proximal interphalangeal hyperextension ranging from zero to almost fifty degrees. Increased measurement accuracy was obtained by using <b>marker</b> <b>frames</b> to amplify finger segment motions. Gravitational forces on the <b>marker</b> <b>frames</b> were not found to invalidate measurements. The recorded interphalangeal joint trajectories were highly consistent, demonstrating the underlying coupling mechanism. The increased accuracy and large sample size allowed for evaluation of detailed trajectory variability, systematic differences between flexion and extension trajectories, and three trigger types, distinct from flexor tendon triggers, involving initial flexion deficits in either proximal or distal interphalangeal joint. The experimental methods, data and analysis should advance insight into normal and pathological finger biomechanics (e. g. swanneck deformities), and could help improve clinical differential diagnostics of trigger finger causes. The <b>marker</b> <b>frame</b> measuring method may be useful to quantify interphalangeal joints trajectories in surgical/rehabilitative outcome studies.

These questions bring us face to face with the limits of the traditional dichotomic representation opposing speech and writing on the sole basis of the medium at hand.

To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} multimodal discourse of academic posters from three disciplines, namely, Chemistry, Speech & Hearing Sciences and Linguistics, {{in an attempt}} to unravel how writers from different disciplinary communities build their communicative purposes into the verbal and visual modes in their posters. The analytical framework adopted for this study builds upon the one proposed by D’Angelo(2010), which incorporates Hyland’s metadiscourse model (2005) and Kress and van Leeuwen’s visual grammar paradigm (2006) for the verbal and visual analyses respectively, and supplements it with multimodal content analysis adapted from Jones’s (2007) model. Follow-up interviews with members of the discourse communities were also conducted to enhance the validity of the results. The findings reveal that there exist a wide range of differences in the use of metadiscourse markers (e. g. hedges, boosters, evidentials, code glosses) across the three group texts pertaining to disciplinary influences. There is also evidence that academics in different subjects value some of the same qualities in the texts necessitated either by the peculiar context of poster presentations (e. g. <b>frame</b> <b>markers,</b> engagement markers) or a need to maintain scientific formality (e. g. self-mentions). Visually, the concern for the context and ‘scientificness’ continue to exert great influences, rendering a myriad of visual manifestations (e. g. framing, modality) that are commonly shared across the data, whereas the cross-discipline discrepancy mainly narrows down to the image usage(functions and types). published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E

One of such features concerns the discourse markers (DMs). By the way, there is much controversy about the meaning of the expression discourse markers. Thus, to Taboada (2006), the first difficulty concerning the DMs is exactly defining what they are and what to call them. Hempel e Degand (2008) have studied such markers which they name <b>frame</b> <b>marker</b> or organization metadiscourse marker, based upon the textual metadiscourse classification (HYLAND; TSE, 2004 : 169). Thompson and Thetela (1995), examining the interpersonal metafunction (HALLIDAY, 1994), propose to divide such metafunction into three functions: (a) personal, the writer´s stance; (b) interactional, the carrying of relations between reader and writer and (c) interactive, having tools that lead the reader through the text, thus considered as an interpersonal element. Halliday, however, would consider it part of the textual metafunction. The objective of this dissertation is examining the occurrences of organization textual discourse markers (TDMs) and interpersonal discourse markers (IDMs) in Portuguese in oral and written texts, according to Dafouz-Milne (2008), based on the classification of Hyland e and Tse (2004). Therefore, it must answer the following questions: (1) what are the TDMs and IDMs that mostly occur in the oral and written modalities? (2) How can these occurrences help to understand the syntax characteristics of these modalities?
