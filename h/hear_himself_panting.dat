60|$|So, quite unexpectedly, {{my brother}} found <b>himself,</b> <b>panting,</b> with a cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an unknown lane {{with these two}} women.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he flung}} <b>himself</b> <b>panting</b> {{on the sofa}} again, and rasped out the remark, [...] "He arrived just at the right moment; I was full {{to the brim with}} bitter thinkings, and nobody to take it out of. How {{refreshing}} it was! I feel better." ...|$|R
60|$|The Irishman gave a {{start of}} astonishment at <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> {{addressed}} in English.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! {{who speaks}} to me?" [...] exclaimed the old man, in a startled voice, like one who <b>hears</b> <b>himself</b> called at an {{unexpected}} moment.|$|R
60|$|It takes a {{multitude}} {{to make such}} a stillness as followed that disorder of cheering. A man alone in a wilderness;--it's stillness of a sort no doubt, but he <b>hears</b> <b>himself</b> breathe, he <b>hears</b> <b>himself</b> move, he <b>hears</b> all sorts of things. Here the voice of Caterham was the one single thing heard, a thing very bright and clear, like a little light burning in a black velvet recess. Hear indeed! One heard him as though he spoke at one's elbow.|$|R
60|$|By this {{pregnant}} speech the farrier had re-established his self-complacency, {{and waited}} with confidence to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> named {{as one of}} the superlatively sensible men.|$|R
60|$|Lydgate {{hated to}} <b>hear</b> <b>himself.</b> But {{he had spoken}} now, and had spoken with unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but also without hesitation.|$|R
50|$|Andrew Filo, {{one of the}} toothbrush's inventors, {{said that}} {{he worked on the}} project because of his {{childhood}} fascination with his ability to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> humming.|$|R
60|$|Sudden color {{rose to his}} forehead, and for {{the first}} time his eyes fell before hers,--not in shame, but with a modest man's {{annoyance}} at <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> praised.|$|R
6000|$|Kennicott observed, [...] "There's {{that old}} crank Wes Brannigan {{shooting}} off his mouth again. Gosh, but {{he loves to}} <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> talk! They ought to run that fellow out of town!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, never start about it, man; you see you are known. [...] Alack-a-day! that {{an honest}} man's son should live {{to start at}} [...] <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> called by his own name." ...|$|R
5000|$|A vivid {{nightmare}} sequence where Bowen {{dreams of}} the dragons he had killed, himself fighting Einon, Einon turning into Draco, and Bowen being sucked into a black void where he's unable to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> screaming for Draco.|$|R
60|$|Don Fernando {{was startled}} at <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> accosted by name, by an utter stranger, {{in a strange}} land. As {{soon as he could}} recover from his surprise, he inquired what land it was at which he had arrived.|$|R
60|$|He {{came up to}} her, his red face, {{with its}} bloodshot eyes, thrust forward, and gripped her arms. She cried in fear of him, {{struggled}} to be free. Coming slightly to <b>himself,</b> <b>panting,</b> he pushed her roughly to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt behind her with a bang. Then he {{went back into the}} kitchen, dropped into his armchair, his head, bursting full of blood, sinking between his knees. Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor, from exhaustion and intoxication.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then you shouldn't {{have brought}} it up,' {{returned}} Mr Codlin; 'and I ask the gentleman's pardon on your account, as a giddy chap that likes to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> talk, and don't much care what he talks about, {{so that he}} does talk.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{did much}} for the poor youth's recovery, the <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> {{addressed}} in such endearing terms, but he experienced a relapse when the monkey, responding to the endearments, ran with obvious joy into the child's bosom, and submitted to a warm embrace.|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the Angel awakened from his wrath, and found <b>himself</b> standing, <b>panting</b> and trembling, {{one foot on}} a motionless figure, under the green stillness of the sunlit woods.|$|R
60|$|A wish was {{of course}} {{expressed}} to hear the adventure of the doctor by all except the improvvisatore, who, being fond of talking and of <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> talk, and accustomed moreover to harangue without interruption, looked rather annoyed at being checked when in full career.|$|R
60|$|This curious old man, {{whose name}} was Jacob, had lived so long by himself that he always thought out loud--louder than other people talk: for, being deaf, he could not <b>hear</b> <b>himself,</b> and never had a {{suspicion}} {{that he could be}} heard by others.|$|R
2500|$|Martin Williams said: [...] "Duke Ellington {{lived long}} enough to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all {{uncommon}} to see him named, along with Charles Ives, as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category." ...|$|R
2500|$|Christie faced a {{disciplinary}} <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> in Seoul {{because of an}} adverse drug test for the banned stimulant pseudoephedrine after he ran in the heats of the 200 m. The hearing panel decided by a single vote to give Christie [...] "the benefit of the doubt", so no sanction was applied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it {{is a bad}} one, Master Jenkin," [...] said Richie. [...] "Nay, never start about it, man--you see you are known. Alack-a-day! that {{an honest}} man's son should live to start at <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> called by his own name!" [...] Jenkin struck his brow violently with his clenched fist.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at Gerald with steady, calm curiosity. He laughed, <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> described. He felt proud too, full of male strength. His blue, keen eyes were {{lit up with}} laughter, his ruddy face, with its sharp fair hair, was full of satisfaction, and glowing with life. He piqued her.|$|R
5000|$|Christie faced a {{disciplinary}} <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> in Seoul {{because of an}} adverse drug test for the banned stimulant pseudoephedrine after he ran in the heats of the 200 m. The hearing panel decided by a single vote to give Christie [...] "the benefit of the doubt", so no sanction was applied.|$|R
5000|$|Green has {{frequently}} said that <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> referenced in an Eminem song {{was one of}} the more surreal and amusing aspects of his own, very sudden fame. The section of the [...] "The Real Slim Shady" [...] that mentions Green was played over the end credits of Green's film Freddy Got Fingered.|$|R
60|$|Hippolyte gave a grunt of {{approval}} to this plain speech. Suzanne exclaimed, but before Nick could answer footsteps were {{heard in the}} path and Lenoir <b>himself,</b> perspiring, <b>panting,</b> exhausted, appeared {{in the midst of}} us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, he was there. He {{is never}} away, I take it, {{when there is}} any talking to be done." [...] Now Mr. Townsend dearly loved to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> talk, but no man was louder against the sins of other orators. And {{then he began to}} ask how many minutes it wanted to dinner-time.|$|R
6000|$|The shock {{received}} by {{the people at the}} station was tremendous. Poor Tipps, standing at his desk, was struck--nervously--as if by electricity. He made one wild involuntary bolt right through the window, {{as if it had been}} made of tissue paper, and did not cease to run until he found <b>himself</b> <b>panting</b> in the middle of a turnip-field that lay at the back of the station. Turning round, ashamed of himself, he ran back faster than he had run away, and leaping recklessly among the debris, began to pull broken and jagged timber about, under the impression that he was rescuing fellow-creatures from destruction! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was sitting}} there one evening, about six o'clock, over a glass of that {{gorgeous}} Burgundy which he kept behind a pile of black-letter folios; he was striding about the room, fingering, after a habit of his, {{one of the great}} swords in his collection; the red glare of the strong fire struck his square features and his fierce grey hair; his blue eyes were even unusually full of dreams, and he had opened his mouth to speak dreamily, when the door was flung open, and a pale, fiery man, with red hair and a huge furred overcoat, swung <b>himself</b> <b>panting</b> into the room.|$|R
60|$|And {{throwing}} his hat over the trees, {{he drew his}} cutlass once more and began to escalade the slope up to the road. Frank Harrogate jumped up and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was astounded to <b>hear</b> <b>himself</b> imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father, {{who seemed to be}} in great agitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell him I'll {{give the}} lecture--with my {{compliments}} and thanks. If I can only succeed," [...] pursued Amelius, <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> {{with the new}} idea, [...] "I may make a name as a lecturer, and a name means money, and money means beating Farnaby with his own weapons. It's an opening for me, Rufus, at the crisis of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, sir, you may {{guess what}} is likely to follow, when a gentleman <b>hears</b> <b>himself</b> unwarrantably and {{unjustly}} slandered," [...] replied Captain Jekyl, surprised and provoked that his annunciation of name and rank seemed to be treated so lightly. [...] "I advise you, sir, not to proceed too far upon the immunities of your age and insignificance." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{he touched}} {{the side of the}} tank he came up. She was not in sight. He drew <b>himself</b> out, <b>panting,</b> and stood ready to dive in {{at the first sign of}} her. But there were no signs.|$|R
6000|$|The {{policeman}} left in {{the room}} was a big, thick-voiced, pompous man, with a horrible unfeeling pleasure in <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> talk before an assembly of frightened, silent people. He told us how he had found her, {{as if he had been}} telling a story in a tap-room, and began with saying: [...] "I don't think the young woman was drunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|He had {{received}} the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> called [...] "Colonel;" [...] {{and if he did}} not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted, certainly he thought about it all the way there.|$|R
60|$|David Deans gave a convulsive {{start at}} <b>hearing</b> <b>himself</b> thus mentioned, and then resumed the situation, in which, {{with his face}} stooped against his hands, and both resting against {{the corner of the}} {{elevated}} bench on which the Judges sate, he had hitherto listened to the procedure in the trial. The Whig lawyers seemed to be interested; the Tories put up their lip.|$|R
