40|$|As {{the science}} of {{building}} agents and agent based applications improves, agents are gradually {{making the transition from}} research laboratory prototypes to industrial applications. In an industrial setting pragmatic engineering issues related to the development and maintenance of agents come to the fore. In this paper a list of important engineering characteristics of agent architectures is presented. The list has the dual aims of providing evaluation criteria for agent users and design issues for agent architecture designers. Evaluation of an architecture with respect to the presented characteristics will allow <b>industrial</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> to better assess the trade oŒs between architectures. Designing architectures that better ful ® ll the characteristics should lead to more industrially relevant architectures and successful agent applications. This list is designed to start discussion and raise awareness of industrial issues. It is hoped that over time good metrics and an evaluation methodology evolve which provide a robust framework for evaluating agent architectures with respect to industrial concerns...|$|R

40|$|Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMTs) {{are widely}} used by {{manufacturing}} organisations all over the world. Unfortunately, the process of implementation of AMT projects has been unsatisfactory and sometimes led to total failure. In the literature, various reasons are brought forward for the deficiency of companies {{to deal with such}} technologies. Most cited reasons were managerial incompetence, organisational inertia and lack of and/or insufficient Technology Learning Process (TLP). Particularly, the Technology Learning Process (TLP) was widely recognised as a significant factor influencing technological change management. For instance, several authors believed that the failure of companies to manage technological change was due to the absence of effective TLP. Hence, studying and identifying the impact of TLP on the technological change management and on operations management is of real importance to reduce this rate of failure. In order to understand how TLP was implemented and what measures were used to determine the practice level of TLP, face-to-face interviews with experienced <b>industrial</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> were held. Based on these interviews, this study developed 46 parameters in order to assess the practice level of TLP in Irish organisations. These parameters were classified into four levels including Basic Level, Average Level, Advanced Level, and World-Class level. To examine the impact of these parameters on the technological change management, postal and online questionnaires were designed and dispatched to all pharmaceutical and chemical firms in Ireland. This was a two-fold objective survey. The first objective was to verify the suitability of this set of parameters over a larger sample of pharmaceutical and chemical organisations. The second objective was to determine the level of TLP practice within the pharmaceutical and chemical firms in Ireland and to investigate the impact of each parameter of this set of parameters on the process of implementation of AMT projects and also on the organisation performance as a whole. The suitability of the proposed conceptual model on wide population was verified. The developed set of parameters was found not only to have significant impact on the process of AMT implementation but also have an influence on the organisation performance...|$|R
40|$|The time is {{ripe for}} a {{comprehensive}} mission to explore and document Earth's species. This calls for a campaign to educate and inspire {{the next generation of}} professional and citizen species explorers, investments in cyber-infrastructure and collections to meet the unique needs of the producers and consumers of taxonomic information, and the formation and coordination of a multi-institutional, international, transdisciplinary community of researchers, scholars and engineers with the shared objective of creating a comprehensive inventory of species and detailed map of the biosphere. We conclude that an ambitious goal to describe 10 million species in less than 50 years is attainable based on the strength of 250 years of progress, worldwide collections, existing experts, technological innovation and collaborative teamwork. Existing digitization projects are overcoming obstacles of the past, facilitating collaboration and mobilizing literature, data, images and specimens through cyber technologies. Charting the biosphere is enormously complex, yet necessary expertise can be found through partnerships with engineers, information scientists, sociologists, ecologists, climate scientists, conservation biologists, <b>industrial</b> <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> and taxon specialists, from agrostologists to zoophytologists. Benefits to society of the proposed mission would be profound, immediate and enduring, from detection of early responses of flora and fauna to climate change to opening access to evolutionary designs for solutions to countless practical problems. The impacts on the biodiversity, environmental and evolutionary sciences would be transformative, from ecosystem models calibrated in detail to comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of life over its 3. 8 billion year history. The resultant cyber-enabled taxonomy, or cybertaxonomy, would open access to biodiversity data to developing nations, assure access to reliable data about species, and change how scientists and citizens alike access, use and think about biological diversity information.

40|$|International audienceIntegration {{projects}} are typically {{faced with a}} proliferation of standards, technologies, platforms and tools. Bespoke solutions are frequently used for what are often generic problems generating work with no discernable business value. Business requirements naturally evolve during the development process. Because {{of the complexity of}} code centric be-spoke solutions, the reactivity to these changes is costly in terms of effort and time. Though model driven development (MDD) promises to have a positive response to these problems, there is little practical evidence of the impact of its infusion. This paper presents a case study conducted in a systems integration company investigating the impact of MDD infusion. We take a practical approach focused on better and more productively meeting customers' requirements. Besides this commercial perspective, our approach takes into account the practical aspects of project activities. One of these aspects is the influence of the motivation and beliefs of actors in the success of a technological change, which we analyse using ActorO Network technological change, which we analyse using actor network theory (ANT). For systems integration companies, the ability to learn is a critical asset and differentiation factor. Knowledge management (KM), as a process through which organizations generate value from their intellectual assets, is another practical aspect we look at. We present preliminary findings of the work completed so far. We look for industrial representativeness of the results, defined here as being "close to real life" experience that <b>industrial</b> actors (<b>project</b> <b>managers,</b> developers, etc.) can relate to, draw conclusions from and translate into action...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the first}} steps in the {{planning}} of a new engineering project in industry is its partition into subtasks and the configuration of a work team to execute it. This decision making process is typically performed by a <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> based on his/her past experience and the available (though frequently scarce, uncertain and dynamic) information about the cognitive and personal characteristics of the available team members. This paper presents our first results {{in the development of}} a knowledge-based tool that aims to help <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> in their decision-making process. Software agents are used to model social human behaviour at work, where human characteristics are represented by a set of fuzzy values, and fuzzy rules model the interaction between the agents to generate the possible performance of a work team.

40|$|According to the Project Management Institute (PMI) project {{management}} consists of planning, organizing, motivating and controlling {{resources such as}} time and cost {{in order to produce}} products with acceptable quality levels. As so, <b>project</b> <b>managers</b> must monitor and control project execution, i. e. verify actual progress and performance of a project with respect to the project plan and timely identify where changes must be made on both process and product. Earned Value Management (EVM) is a valuable technique for determining and monitoring the progress of a project as it indicates performance variances based on measures related to work progress, schedule and cost information. This technique requires that a set of metrics be systematically collected throughout the entire project. A consequence is that, for large and long <b>projects,</b> <b>managers</b> may encounter difficulties in interpreting all the information collected and using it for decision-making. To assist managers in this tedious task, in this paper we classify the EVM metrics distinguishing them into five conceptual classes and present an interpretation model that managers can adopt as checklist for monitoring EVM values and tracking the project's progress. At this point of our research the decision model has been applied during an <b>industrial</b> <b>project</b> to monitor project progress and guide <b>project</b> <b>manager</b> decisions.
