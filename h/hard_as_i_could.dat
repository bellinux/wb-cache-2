And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel.

500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E

He pretty near got my coat off in the struggle, and next moment the police-man 'ad turned his lantern on me and they was both staring {{at me as if}} they couldn't believe their eyesight.|$|R

"This {{is a fine}} {{place of}} my son's, sir," [...] cried the old man, while <b>I</b> nodded <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>could.</b> [...] "This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir.

500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

Cottrell then put Phillips in a headlock, pulled {{him to the floor}} and [...] "started hitting him as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> as many times as I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball. Says Baldelli, [...] "In Princeton, I {{had a hard time}} with all parts of the game…I didn't know how to play the game. Coming out of high school, I'd just come {{up to the plate and}} swing as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> every time and try to smoke the ball. I didn't know about hitting mechanics, breaking pitches or reading pitchers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is done at last," [...] said one; [...] "the {{worst and}} hardest labour I ever did in my life. I {{believe there is}} no luck about me left.

60|$|In {{this manner}} I went {{all through the}} cabin, hitting {{everybody}} <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> a lash <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and laying the whole blame on the infernal Englishman.

5000|$|Johnagin's {{television}} {{credits include}} Comedy Central's Live at Gotham , Comedy Central's The Half Hour, CMT Comedy Stage. He {{has participated in}} Comedy's Central's South Beach Comedy Festival and has made numerous guest appearances on The Bob & Tom Show and The Ron and Fez Show. Johnagin said of this period in his career, [...] "I made it my goal to work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could</b> the whole time I've been doing this. I didn't really take my time doing anything. Just constantly writing and constantly performing." [...] When Johnagin began his stand-up career, he made his act consciously clean and family-friendly; later, he incorporated more risque material into his act, but continues not to curse during performance.|$|R
2500|$|When the pitstops {{were over}} (two for Ferrari on Bridgestones, one for McLaren and Williams on Michelins), David Coulthard was behind Barrichello by {{the length of}} the main {{straight}} but secure in third place. Montoya closed the gap {{toward the end of the}} race, but did not threaten last podium position. [...] "For the last 40 laps, I was not pushing as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done because I chose to look after my engine," [...] Coulthard said afterwards.|$|E

60|$|Dear, dear, {{to think}} how much time we passed alone {{together}} afterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll {{the story of my}} birthday and confided to her that <b>I</b> would try <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt guilty and yet innocent) and would strive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> grew up to be industrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some one, and win some love to myself if <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think of it. I am very thankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to my eyes.|$|R
60|$|During {{the three}} years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I did less {{scientific}} work, though <b>I</b> worked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could,</b> than during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing to frequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious illness. The greater part of my time, when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything, was devoted to my work on 'Coral Reefs,' which I had begun before my marriage, and of which the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book, though a small one, cost me twenty months of <b>hard</b> work, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had to read every work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It was thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given is, I think, now well established.|$|R
60|$|I put {{the orange}} in his hand, and bade him tell {{his father that}} a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff {{appeared}} on the door-stones; and I turned directly {{and ran down the}} road <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> race, making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had raised a goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to cheek the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did!' {{she went}} on, defiantly. 'I hit him as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and he--he'--she broke {{off into a}} little gurgle of laughter--'he tripped over a bush and fell right down; and I wasn't a bit ashamed. I didn't think it unladylike or anything. I was just as proud as I could be. And it stopped him talking.' ...|$|E
60|$|Never in {{the world}} was a command obeyed so {{promptly}} as that one. In an instant I had bounded to my feet and rushed as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{to the back of the}} hall.

6000|$|... "If I'd {{a wallet}} full of papers {{certifying}} me as a harmless traveler, {{it would be}} south just as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hit the trail.

6000|$|... "I know. Twenty-seven. You {{finished}} {{college at}} twenty-two. You've dabbled and played and frilled for five years. Before God and man, of what use are you?

I lived on jerked beef and bear-meat. I am a better man physically right now than you are. You weigh about one hundred and sixty-five. I can throw you right now, or thrash you with my fists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will wonder perhaps why {{all this}} time I did not take to the water; but lions, although, like all the cat tribe, disliking water, will cross rivers by swimming, and they seemed so pertinacious that I feared they might follow me. Towards morning, however, I {{determined}} on risking it, and creeping out {{to the end of}} a branch which overhung the river I dropped in. The stream was running strong, and I kept under water, swimming down with it <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could.</b> When <b>I</b> came up I glanced back at the tree I had quitted. The lions were gathered on the bank, roaring loudly and lashing their tails with every sign of excitement, looking at the water where they had seen me disappear. I have not the least doubt but that they would have jumped in after me, had I not dived I took this in at a glance, and then went under again, and so continued diving until I was sure that I was beyond the sight of the lions; then I made for the bank as quickly as possible. The river swarmed with crocodiles, and had it not been for the muddiness of the water I should probably have been snapped up within a minute or two of entering it.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the reader may be aware that I thought John Stumpy's secrets important. Such was a fact. Try <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was able, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but imagine that they {{concerned}} {{my father and his}} alleged downfall.|$|R
6000|$|At half-past four I had the cab; [...] I drove as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go. [...] The London sky was dirty drab, [...] And dirty brown the London snow.

60|$|For {{the first}} time in my life I was frightened by hogs. I struck at them as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and before I knew what I was about I flung down the stick, made a rush for that gate, and was on top of it in no time, in company with the three other young women that was sitting there already.|$|E
60|$|Yet try as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> it was {{impossible}} for me to discover what he really did mean. I was not conscious of having done him any injury, either bodily or otherwise. Indeed, of late I had hardly seen the man. The Widow Canby was not partial to dealings with him, and I never went near him on my own account.|$|E
6000|$|... "I work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. Old Moncrief {{seems to}} think that a fellow ought to do nothing else from morning till night but write Latin verses.

60|$|I ran {{out with}} Edwin, I opened the chaise door, I took Emmeline in my arms, I folded her to my heart.
