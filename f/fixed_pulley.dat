40|$|Abstract — Increased {{miniaturization}} {{of surgical}} instruments {{is essential to}} successfully perform surgical procedures in restricted areas as in many applications of minimally-invasive surgery. Miniaturization permits increase in dexterity and decrease in access incisions which are required in many surgical procedures. Tendon-based transmissions provide several important advantages for the mechanical design of miniaturized surgical devices. Reflected mass and inertia are reduced since tendon-based transmissions allow to locate the motors far apart from the actuated joint. In spite of providing several important advantages, they introduce several non linear effects that must be considered and modeled to achieve suitable performance. In this paper tendon-based transmission system for surgical robotics is illustrated. And nonlinear friction, due to direct sliding of synthetic fiber cables over small <b>fixed</b> <b>pulleys</b> (pins) is discussed and models aiming at compensating these nonlinearities are presented...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical systems {{including}} conveyor belts, {{band saw}} blades, and power transmission belts {{are influenced by}} the lateral motion of the moving structure. This phenomenon was studied in the literature both using the theory of the continuous linear and nonlinear systems and following the multibody technique.

Efficiency of systems is affected by problems like friction, {{which is also a}} major problem for energy consumption in the world. In a pulley system consisting of an electric motor, <b>fixed</b> <b>pulleys</b> and a load; “Does changing the number of pulleys in a pulley system affect friction and hence efficiency of the system to alter?” question is tested. The experiment was made in two parts. First, revolutions per minute (rev/min – rpm) pattern of the electric motor was plotted on a graph. After deciding the voltage for second part, the effect of friction on the efficiency of the pulley systems was investigated. For that, the number of pulleys attached to the system was increased step by step and how high (meters) the 0. 1 kg mass is pulled in 1 minute time by the electric motor is measured. Comparing theoretical height and measured height values gave the energy loss at the system. According to the law of conservation of energy that loss should be due to the effect of friction. So, the efficiency of the system was calculated using the data gathered. The results were plotted on a graph and they showed that as the number of pulleys in the system increases from 1 blue pulley to 5 black & 5 blue pulleys step by step, the efficiency of the system decreases from 99. 598...|$|R

As with the traverser the tram track passed under the horizontal beam. The wagon or truck containing the cane stalks was driven along the tram tracks to a position beneath the horizontal beam.

50|$|Some drill presses {{and milling}} {{machines}} contain a pulley-based CVT where the output shaft has {{a pair of}} manually adjustable conical pulley halves through which a wide drive belt from the motor loops. The pulley on the motor, however, is usually fixed in diameter, or may {{have a series of}} given-diameter steps to allow a selection of speed ranges. A handwheel on the drill press, marked with a scale corresponding to the desired machine speed, is mounted to a reduction gearing system for the operator to precisely control the width of the gap between the pulley halves. This gap width thus adjusts the gearing ratio between the motor's <b>fixed</b> <b>pulley</b> and the output shaft's variable pulley, changing speed of the chuck. A tensioner pulley is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered. In most cases, the speed must be changed with the motor running.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the rotation vibration {{dynamics of the}} pulleys and the tension arms, and to estimate the vibrations of the belts and the slip ratio between the belt and the pulleys in the engine front-end accessory drive systems, a systematic modelling and analytical method is proposed for engine front-end accessory drive systems; this {{can be used for}} modelling engine front-end accessory drive systems with different layouts and different numbers of tensioners, including automatic and fixed tensioners. In the modelling, the rotational pulleys are classified as fixed-axis pulleys and moveable-axis pulleys (such as the pulley in the tensioner). Moreover, the belt spans are classified as the belt spans between the two <b>fixed</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and the belt spans adjacent to the pulley of a tensioner. The equations of motion for each type of pulley and the tension calculation equations for each type of belt span are developed. In this way, the equations of motion for all the pulleys and the tensioner arms can be obtained easily, irrespective of the layout of the tensioners. To obtain the dynamic rotational vibration responses of an engine front-end accessory drive system by the conventional Runge-Kutta method, high-efficiency algorithms or methods are also proposed for calculating the tangent-point coordinates between a belt and the adjacent pulleys and the belt length of the contact arc on one pulley. The proposed modelling and analysis methods are validated by modelling different layouts of the engine front-end accessory drive systems with different types and numbers of tensioners, and also by comparisons between the calculated dynamic vibration responses of the pulleys and the belts and the real experimental data.

40|$|Nowadays, {{vibration}} energy harvesting is {{becoming one of}} the most promising technologies. However, the limited applications and techniques of ocean wave energy conversion have been reported. In this thesis, recently published researches for electromagnetic {{vibration energy}} harvesting techniques have been studied. The various techniques are classified in terms of micro and macro vibration energy harvesters, broad bandwidth vibration energy harvesters, and large scale ocean wave energy converters. The review of the nonlinear oscillator vibration energy harvester based on magnetic spring is focused. The efficiency of extracting energy from the waves is limited, although various concepts and designs of the power take-off systems and primary interface and circuits have been studied. This thesis will identify the possible power take-off systems from reviewing electromagnetic vibration energy harvesting techniques aiming to increase the power and bandwidth of ocean wave energy converter for maximizing future utilization of the ocean wave energy. This thesis invents a cuboid generator with high vibration energy harvesting performance. The cuboid vibration energy harvester consists of a <b>fixed</b> <b>pulley</b> mechanism connecting two magnet array units with a coil unit on the two sides of the pulleys. The two magnet array units are arranged in double Halbach magnet arrays which are used to increase the magnetic field intensity and flux intensity change rate around the coils. The <b>fixed</b> <b>pulley</b> mechanism is used to double the speed of the magnets with respect to the coil unit. As the output voltage of the vibration energy harvester is proportional to the magnetic field intensity and flux intensity change rate around the coils and the speed of the magnets with respect to the coils. The novel design of the prismatic tube vibration energy harvester has a high vibration or wave energy harvesting performance or capacity. This thesis investigates the cuboid generator functioning as vibration energy harvester or wave energy converter through linear and nonlinear oscillator dynamic analyses in a low frequency range. Duffing type nonlinear oscillator dynamic differential equation is developed for the nonlinear analysis where the effect of the rotational inertia of the pulleys on the oscillator mass is considered, which is different from the literatures. The nonlinear oscillator dynamic differential equation is solved by using the harmonic balance method and perturbation method in order to widen energy harvesting frequency bandwidth. The formula of the dimensionless harvested power of the nonlinear oscillator mass-spring-damper system is derived and a parameter study is conducted for the design optimisation of the harvester. The parameters that affect the nonlinearity of the oscillator are also studied in this thesis. Finally, the prototype of the novel device is built and tested to validate the analysis. The influence of nonlinear oscillator interaction force acting on the moving part on the generator&rsquo;s potential well is also studied in this thesis. It is found that large displacement excitation amplitude and nonlinear stiffness k 3 will increase the nonlinearity, output voltage and harvesting frequency bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} Atwood's machine (Atm) {{problem is}} revisited {{in order to}} introduce young students on advanced concepts in Physics. Atm is an old-fashioned device. However, {{it allows us to}} speak about relativity of motion, principle of equivalence, inertial and non-inertial frames of reference, general covariance and invariance under coordinate transformations. Besides, it also provides experimental support for our theoretical models. We have started with coordinate transformations and inertial and non inertial reference frames followed by the principle of equivalence. The composed Atm was worked out in the following. We calculate the acceleration in the machine applying Newton's Laws to describe its dynamics in an inertial frame on the <b>fixed</b> <b>pulley</b> center and in a non-inertial one on the moving pulley center. Coordinate transformations mapping inertial frame solutions in non-inertial ones and vice-versa allow students catch on relativity concepts and the role played by general covariance. A comparison between these solutions showed the importance of the principle of equivalence in the evaluation of the intensity of gravity locally. In addition, according to this coordinate transformation the non-inertial reference frame equations of motion are equivalent to one single Atm plus one falling mass. Our results have also shown, in agreement with experimental outcomes, that after movement starts single Atm becomes lighter than $m_{ 3 }$ mass, consequently $m_{ 3 }$ mass is falling. It is a non-intuitive experimental result first observed for the 1854 Poggendorff's fall machine. A measure of single Atm's mass reduction was reported in 2016 's last issue of Physics Education.

40|$|INGINE Inc. {{developed}} its own {{wave energy}} converter (WEC) named INWAVE and has currently installed three prototype modules in Jeju Island, Korea. This device is an on-shore-type WEC that consists of a buoy, <b>pulleys</b> <b>fixed</b> to the sea-floor and a power take off module (PTO). Three ropes are moored tightly {{on the bottom of}} the buoy and connected to the PTO via the pulleys, which are moving back and forth according to the motion of the buoy. Since the device can harness wave energy from all six degrees of movement of the buoy, it is possible to extract energy efficiently even under low energy density conditions provided in the coastal areas. In the PTO module, the ratchet gears convert the reciprocating movement of the rope drum into a uni-directional rotation and determine the transmission of power from the relation of the angular velocities between the rope drum and the generator. In this process, the discontinuity of the power transmission occurs and causes the modeling divergence. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the virtual torsion spring in order to prevent the impact error in the ratchet gear module, thereby completing the PTO modeling. In this paper, we deal with dynamic analysis in the time domain, based on Newtonian mechanics and linear wave theory. We derive the combined dynamics of the buoy and PTO modules via geometric relation between the buoy and mooring ropes, then suggest the ratchet gear mechanism with the virtual torsion spring element to reduce the dynamic errors during the phase transitions. Time domain simulation is carried out under irregular waves that reflect the actual wave states of the installation area, and we evaluate the theoretical performance using the capture width ratio...|$|R
