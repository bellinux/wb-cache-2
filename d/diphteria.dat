Currently children are immunized against <b>diphteria,</b> pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, invasive Haemophilus influenza type b, mumps, measles, rubella, invasive meningococcal infections type C and hepatitis B. Information from different surveillance systems was used to describe trends in mortality and morbidity for the period 1997 - 2002. The main sources used were the Central Bureau of Statistics for mortality figures, the National Medical Registration for hospital admissions and the Medical Inspectorate of health for notifications of the notifiable diseases. It is evident that the diseases included in the immunization programme are under control due to high immunization coverage levels; the European Region has been declared polio-free and very few cases of <b>diphteria,</b> tetanus, mumps and rubella were reported for the given period in the Netherlands. However, several findings stress the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage levels and continuous monitoring of the target diseases. Pertussis, for example, shows that a disease can still be endemic with epidemic peaks despite high vaccination coverage levels. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of measles shows that clustering of unvaccinated individuals {{plays an important role in}} the (re) occurrence of disease. The essential dynamics of an immunization programme were illustrated by the actions taken in reponse to the considerable increase in cases of meningococcal infections.

In the affected area childhood immunization are given according to a simplified vaccination schedule with only two doses of a quadruple DTCP (DPT-IPV) vaccine (against <b>diphteria,</b> tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis). A total of 115 children was studied (interview, serology, classical culture, PCR test). The clinical diagnosis could be confirmed in a number of children by serology. Among children of 5 years and older some had received two DTCP caccinations. Younger children seemed to be protected better against pertussis. The numbers of children studied are too small however for a precise estimate of pertussis vaccin efficacy in this particular immunization program with simplified schedule...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Actin protein {{has many}} other {{cellular}} {{functions such as}} movement, chemotaxis, secretion and cytodiaresis. Besides, it have structural function. Actin is a motor pro-tein that it has {{an important role in}} the movement process of toxin in the cell. It is known that F-actin gives carriage support during the endosomal process. Actin is found in globular (G) and filamentous (F) structure in the cell. The helix of actin occurs as a result of polymerisation of monomeric G-actin molecules through sequential rowing, is called F-actin (FA). Actin interacts with a great number of cellular proteins along with cell skeleton and plasma membrane. It is also known that some bacterial toxins have ADP-ribosylation affect on actin. <b>Diphteria</b> toxin is the part which has the FA enzymatic activity corresponding the N-terminal section of the toxin, which inhibits the protei...|$|E
40|$|Mono ADP-ribosyltransferases (mADP-RTs) are {{a family}} of enzymes that cleave NAD+ and covalently attach the ADP-ribosyl moiety to target proteins. mADP-RTs are well {{established}} as important virulence factors of bacteria that infect mammals. Cholera toxin, pertussis toxin and <b>diphteria</b> toxin are three of the best-known examples of mADP-RTs. They modify host target proteins {{in order to promote}} infection and/or killing of the host cell. Despite low sequence similarity at the primary amino acid level, mADP-RTs share a conserved core catalytic fold and structural biology has made important contributions to elucidating how mADP-RTs modify mammalian host targets. Recently, mADP-RTs were shown to be present in plant pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that mADP-RTs are also important virulence factors of plant pathogens. Crystal structures of plant pathogenic bacterial mADP-RTs are also now available. Here we review the structure/function of mADP-RTs from pathogens of mammals and plants, highlighting both commonalities and differences...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{health care}} {{during the period}} 1980 - 1982 in the sector of Kasongo-Lunda, Zaire is considered. Health {{infrastructure}} and main health problems are discussed. These problems were mainly diarrheas, respiratory infections, malaria, tuberculosis/whooping cough, measles, malnutrition and wormrelated diseases. A vaccination programme against <b>diphteria,</b> tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, measles and tuberculosis was set up and adapted to W. H. O. recommendations in 1981. The incidence of measles and whooping cough declined dramatically during the period 1978 - 1982. Diarrhea was treated with oral rehydration. About 167. of the children under five years of age suffered from malnutrition, mostly related to worm diseases; therefore, a suppressive dose of antihelminthics was given every three months. These results show that local health centers, concerned with everyday health problems of the population, can have a strong positive influence upon the general health situation of a rural population...|$|E
40|$|Cross Reacting Material 197 (CRM 197) is a <b>Diphteria</b> toxin non toxic mutant {{that had}} shown anti-tumor {{activity}} in mice and humans. CRM 197 is utilized {{as a specific}} inhibitor of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), that competes for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), overexpressed in colorectal cancer and implicated in its progression. We evaluated the effects of CRM 197 on HT- 29 human colon cancer cell line behaviour and, for CRM 197 recognized ability to inhibit HB-EGF, its possible effects on EGFR activation. In particular, while HT- 29 does not show any reduction of viability after CRM 197 treatment, or changes in cell cycle distribution, in EGFR localization or activation, they show a change in gene expression profile analyzed by microarray. This is the first study where the CRM 197 treatment on HT- 29 show the alteration of a specific and selected number of genes. ...|$|E
40|$|Twenty residue {{peptides}} {{from the}} 185 - 200 -kD and 45 -kD merozoite surface antigens of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum were covalently linked to diphtheria toxoid as a carrier {{and used to}} immunize human volunteers with aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant. Significant antibody levels were elicited by two boosting injections. The antibodies reacted with acetone-methanol fixed merozoite membranes in an immunofluorescence assay, but no inhibition of merozoite reinvasion could be detected in in vitro cultures containing the antibodies. Antibody levels against the immunizing peptides declined markedly within 77 days after the third injection. No hypersensitivity was observed against the peptides. However, the volunteers developed hypersensitivity against <b>diphteria</b> toxoid, and in particular a pronounced type III (Arthus) hypersensitivity after three injections with the toxoid. This effect might appear to limit the use of peptide-diphtheria toxoid conjugates for human immunization. Several biochemical, haematological and immunological tests done on the volunteers showed no other adverse effects from the immunizations...|$|E
40|$|The Multitest {{skin test}} allows the {{simultaneous}} intradermal application of seven standardized recall antigens in a reproducible manner. Response reading {{is based on}} a scoring system that distinguishes between normal and diminished delayed hypersensitivity (DH). To determine incidence and size of DH responses for each antigen in relation to age and sex in healthy Italian children, a multicentric study was performed on a representative paediatric population of 491 subjects (285 males and 296 females) aged from 4 months to 16 years. In both sexes DH reactivity as measured by score and number of positive responses increased significantly with age. The incidence of anergy was 8. 8 % for the whole population and decreased significantly with age in both sexes. Incidence of positive responses was highest for tetanus and <b>diphteria</b> toxoids, intermediate for Candida, Proteus and Streptococcus, and lowest for tuberculin and Trichophyton antigens. There {{was no significant difference between}} sexes in the incidence of positive response to each antigen...|$|E
