5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{longitudinal}} method, the magnetization {{is normal}} to the surface. A transition region (domain walls) is formed between domains, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> magnetic field exits the material. If the domain wall {{is located at}} the interface of two north-pole domains then the field is directed outward, and for two south-pole domains it is directed inward. To read the direction of the magnetic field above the domain wall, the magnetization direction is fixed normal to <b>the</b> surface <b>in</b> <b>the</b> antiferromagnetic layer and parallel to <b>the</b> surface <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> layer. Changing <b>the</b> direction of the external magnetic field deflects <b>the</b> magnetization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> layer. When <b>the</b> field tends to align <b>the</b> magnetizations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> and fixed layers, the electrical resistance of the sensor decreases, and vice versa.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{cooperative}} spectrum <b>sensing,</b> each CR usually performs <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> {{individually and}} then reports the local observations {{to a common}} fusion unit (FU). This unit gathers the information from all sensors involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> process, generates <b>the</b> decision {{on the presence of}} other users <b>in</b> <b>the</b> channel of interest and broadcasts the decision to the CRs. If a large number of CRs participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensing</b> process, it is expectable that even though some will suffer from <b>the</b> localized <b>sensing</b> limitations (hidden node, deep fading, shadowing and sensing performance), others will output correct reports and the overall decision will be more reliable.
