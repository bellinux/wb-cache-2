5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—as well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases {{linked to the}} paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett is paired with an {{enthusiastic}} young agent named Leyla Harrison who <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> about the X-Files, when Scully goes on maternity leave. Harrison's apotheosis of Mulder and Scully leads to Doggett learning a thing or two. But when Harrison and Doggett disappear, Mulder defies orders {{in an attempt to}} find them.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he <b>knows</b> <b>everything.</b> He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he <b>knows</b> <b>everything,</b> and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

5|$|Declan {{discovers that}} Paul is having {{financial}} difficulties and tells Rebecca. Paul {{gets into a}} dispute with a builder and tampers with the scaffolding at his site. Declan follows Paul and becomes angry with him. Donna is injured at the site and Paul decides to frame Declan by doctoring the CCTV footage. Declan finds out and asks Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to help him. Toadie tells Declan that Paul has embezzled money from Lassiter's Hotel and Declan tells Diana Marshall (Jane Badler). Diana comes to Erinsborough and Declan tells her {{he made a mistake}} to protect Rebecca. Diana does not believe him and she finds the evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks Declan to take his place as manager of Lassiter's for six months and Declan and Diana team up to bring Paul down. Declan neglects Kate and she ends their relationship. He later kisses Candace Carey, which Kate witnesses. Paul discovers Diana and Declan's plan and threatens Declan. Paul is later pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. Declan is questioned by Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) over the accident. Declan and Kate sleep together, but Kate tells him that it was a mistake. Declan encourages Rebecca to divorce Paul, but she tells him that Paul <b>knows</b> <b>everything.</b> Declan tells her that they need to leave. When Kate finds them packing, Declan tells her that he pushed Paul. However, he is covering for his mother.|$|E
5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he <b>knows</b> <b>everything,</b> and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

25|$|Muffy is {{a member}} of Alana's (and, later on, Bianca's) posse. Her role in the posse is to record {{important}} events (like an organizer) and tends to explain what Alana (and, later on, Bianca) say which is usually brief. She took over as Raven's foremost enemy after Bianca left. There is some speculation that she might be psychic because she <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> that Alana and Bianca are thinking. She also has a younger sister, Buffy, who is Sydney's age, and enemy.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, many Christian {{scholars}} {{wrestled with}} {{the conflict between the}} belief in free will and its implied randomness, and the idea that God <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> that happens. Saints Augustine and Aquinas tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but Martin Luther argued against randomness and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas viewed randomness not {{as the result of a}} single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of randomness, he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.|$|E
25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> {{there is to know about}} colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he <b>knows</b> <b>everything.</b> At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
25|$|Gurūpasattiḥ (Sanskrit: गुरूपसत्तिः). Paraśurāma is {{welcomed by}} Śiva at Kailāsa. Śiva {{promises}} to offer all his knowledge to his disciple. Śiva tells Paraśurāma {{that he knows}} {{him to be the}} Avatāra of Rāma, who <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> beforehand but is studying from a Guru only to set an example for others. The education of Paraśurāma begins. Paraśurāma masters all Vedic Mantras on just hearing them once from his Guru. Śiva teaches him all the eighteen Vidyās. Paraśurāma serves Śiva like the ideal disciple, waking up early morning, getting water and victuals for his Guru, pleasing Śiva and his consort Pārvatī in every way. The Samāvartana Saṃskāra (end of student life) of Paraśurāma is performed by Śiva, who blesses his disciple by saying that may the eighteen Vidyās be ever with him, and may his weapons be ever virtuous. Śiva orders him to assume a furious form when Rāma breaks Pināka, the bow of Śiva, in Mithilā. Śiva further ordains Paraśurāma to surrender his bow and arrows to Rāma, and to merge his Avatāra into the Rāma Avatāra. For the rest of his life, Paraśurāma is asked to perform penance on the Mahendra mountain. Finally Śiva says that Paraśurāma will be among the seven seers (Saptarṣi) in the eighth Manvantara of Sāvarṇi Manu, just like his father Jamadagni is one in the seventh Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu. Paraśurāma bows to Śiva and asks permission to leave.|$|E
25|$|Nine years later, in 1832, Paris is in {{upheaval}} {{because of}} the impending death of General Lamarque, {{the only man in}} the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras, who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Thénardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang; their daughter Éponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin Gavroche, who <b>knows</b> <b>everything</b> that happens in the slums ("Look Down"). The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Thénardier suddenly recognizes Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed here in Paris, comes to the rescue ("The Robbery"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Thénardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars (which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin) that he will find Valjean and recapture him ("Stars"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades Éponine to help him find Cosette ("Éponine's Errand").|$|E

25|$|Paul suffers some {{financial}} difficulties with his businesses – Lassiter's Hotel and PirateNet, a local radio station. To help ease his problems, he transfers $100,000 from the Lassiter's Corporation into the PirateNet accounts and tells his wife, Rebecca, {{that it is}} from an anonymous benefactor. Rebecca's son, Declan, believes Paul has been embezzling money from Lassiter's and contacts Diana Marshall about his suspicions. Diana is sent to Erinsborough to investigate Paul's dealings, on behalf of Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who owns a significant stake in Lassiter's. Paul hires Toadfish Rebecchi to be his lawyer and Toadie discovers Paul's embezzlement. Paul tries to cover up what he has done, but his son, Andrew, accidentally gives Diana proof of the crime. After learning that Diana <b>knows</b> <b>everything,</b> Paul asks her {{to join him in}} taking over the company. To prove to her that he is serious, Paul has sex with her, but Diana tells him that she is going to take his job. Paul hires a private investigator to bug Toadie's phone in the hope of finding something to blackmail him with. He learns that Toadie is helping Stephanie Scully to cover up {{the fact that she is}} pregnant by her best friend's husband. Paul then asks Toadie to make it look like Diana embezzled the money instead. Toadie later agrees to help Diana bring Paul down. Paul learns Toadie and Diana are working together, so to punish Toadie, he reveals his and Steph's secret over the radio.|$|E

Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day.

500|$|According to {{the musical}} scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his {{well-known}} bon mot about Saint-Saëns, [...] "He <b>knows</b> <b>everything,</b> but lacks inexperience" [...] ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience"). The winner, Victor Sieg, {{had a career}} no more notable {{than that of the}} 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may [...] "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency". The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, [...] "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does." [...] The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was [...] "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul". The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as [...] "Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius", and [...] "Bad music well written".|$|E
