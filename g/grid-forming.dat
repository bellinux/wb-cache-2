40|$|A <b>grid-forming</b> {{inverter}} (GFI) is {{an important}} component for operation of an islanded microgrid. Its purpose, similar to a conventional slack bus generator, is to build up a reference voltage for other distributed generating units in the microgrid. Usually, a nested-loop PI control structure is employed to control a <b>grid-forming</b> inverter in a dq reference frame. However, conventional PIbased nested-loop control method has a deteriorative performance under parameter variations. In this paper, a novel nested-loop control strategy is proposed for control of a <b>grid-forming</b> inverter system containing an LC output filter and loads. The proposed method doesn’t require a precise model for the inverter system and can better deal with uncertainties and LC filter resonance without using any passive or active damping mechanisms. It utilizes a sliding mode control in the inner current loop and a mixed H 2 /H 1 optimal control in the outer voltage loop, which provides the advantages of constant switching frequency, low total harmonic distortion (THD), robustness against parameters variations and fast transient response. The simulation and hardware experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the proposed controller’s improved transient and steadystate performance in various key criteria, over conventional PI-based nested-loop control strategy...|$|E
40|$|The droop {{method is}} the most {{favorable}} alternative in microgrid implementations for autonomous control of <b>grid-forming</b> inverter-based distributed generators (DGs) connected in parallel. However, the dynamic characteristic of the conventional droop method is poor because the inertias of inverter-based DG units are extremely low and the transmission line is normally very short. An output impedance control method to enhance the dynamic performance and minimize the circulating current between <b>grid-forming</b> DGs is devised in this study. It is shown that it also enhances the power and harmonic sharing accuracy. The proposed method utilizes the virtual output impedance as a control signal for reactive power flow management.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>grid-forming</b> control of power converters in low-inertia power systems. Starting from an average-switch three-phase inverter model, we draw parallels to a synchronous machine (SM) model and propose a novel <b>grid-forming</b> converter control strategy which dwells upon the main characteristic of a SM: {{the presence of an}} internal rotating magnetic field. In particular, we augment the converter system with a virtual oscillator whose frequency is driven by the DC-side voltage measurement and which sets the converter pulse-width-modulation signal, thereby achieving exact matching between the converter in closed-loop and the SM dynamics. We then provide a sufficient condition assuring existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of equilibria in a coordinate frame attached to the virtual oscillator angle. By actuating the DC-side input of the converter we are able to enforce this sufficient condition. In the same setting, we highlight strict incremental passivity, droop, and power-sharing properties of the proposed framework, which are compatible with conventional requirements of power system operation. We subsequently adopt disturbance decoupling techniques to design additional control loops that regulate the DC-side voltage, as well as AC-side frequency and amplitude, while in the end validating them with numerical experiments...|$|E

For this reason, it can be characterized as a <b>grid-forming</b> converter [20]. Furthermore, taking measurements from the battery bank about its SoC, the converter undertakes the charge and discharge operation of the battery.|$|E
40|$|Islanded micro-grids are {{increasingly}} becoming a vital factor {{in improving the}} reliability of a power system. In the islanded micro-grid power is produced from a local energy source {{that can be a}} renewable energy plant or an energy storage system. If for example, the energy produced from solar panels and energy storage systems is fed to the grid an inverter is required to change the direct current produced by the solar panels to the alternating current. In the islanded micro-grid the inverter is used to form the phase voltages. Dynamic models of power electronic converters have been previously developed in the literature. A useful feature of a dynamic model is that {{it can be used to}} tune controllers for the inverter and analyze stability. However, a dynamic model of the <b>grid-forming</b> inverter with respect to its true dynamics has not been reported and analyzed at the same time properly. This thesis investigates, how to develop a dynamic model of the <b>grid-forming</b> inverter. A circuit diagram of the inverter, where the load is modeled as an ideal current sink is used as a basis for the modeling. Equations from the circuit diagram are written for a state space model. The state space model consists of linearized equations in a synchronous reference frame. The synchronous reference frame is used so that traditional control theory can be employed. Transfer functions that describe the dynamics from the system inputs to the system outputs are solved from the state-space presentation. Analysis of the solved open-loop transfer functions shows that the dynamics of the grid-feeding and <b>grid-forming</b> inverter differ significantly. In orderer to tune reasonable controller the size of the capacitor in a commonly used LCL-filter has to be increased compared to grid-feeding inverter.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of the power system, VSC-based DG was originally expected to operate as a static synchronous generator (SSG) [6]. However, different from the traditional synchronous generator (SG), the VSC is regarded as a device of the flexible AC transmission system (FACTS), which is only responsible for exchanging controllable real and reactive power as an ancillary facility [7, 8] instead of bringing <b>grid-forming</b> capabilities into the power grid. Therefore, a considerable portion of VSCs are operated in current-source controlled (CC) mode, to keep the simplicity of the control strategy as well as an adequate utilization of renewable power [2]. From {{the perspective}} of emerging microgrid [9], control strategies are first proposed for parallel-connected VSC-based DGs in a standalone AC supply system [10], which is also motivated by the challenges in uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems [11, 12]. On this technical route, the VSC is regarded as an essential <b>grid-forming</b> component of the electrical grid, and it is operated in a voltage-source controlled (VC) mode. As an interface between DG systems and the grid, VSCs are endowed with similar responsibilities as the traditional SGs to deliver electric power into the AC grid. Nevertheless, VSCs lack rotating inertia and damping properties compared with the traditional SG. As the penetration level of VSC-based DG increases in modern power systems, traditional SGs, along with the inherent rotating inertia and damping properties to which they contribute, will be replaced on a large scale. The overall system inertia and damping are dramatically decreased, which can pose threats to grid dynamic performance and stability [13, 14, 15]. It is characterized by the low-frequency oscillations of power and frequency during various disturbances [14, 15, 16, 17]. The oscillations may lead to over-current trip of the transmission line or even system disconnection [18]. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the stability of the modern power system with increasing VSCs.|$|E

Two main operating modes are possible: grid-feeding, when system operates as a power source connected to the grid, and <b>grid-forming</b> (standalone), when system operates as a voltage source supplying an islanded load. A two-level global control architecture is employed for both cases, which relies on three-phase current control in the alpha-beta frame as inner loops. Proportional-resonant (PR) controllers are used to this end.

By considering the primary (local) control of the <b>grid-forming</b> converters of a microgrid, optimal parameters can be directly applied to the control of this level, thus achieving higher control accuracy and faster response. The optimization problem is solved in a heuristic way by using genetic algorithms. In order to test the proposed algorithm, a six-bus droop-controlled DC microgrid is used as a case-study.

30|$|In the literature, the {{critical}} role of the energy storage system {{is focused on the}} regulation of the voltage and frequency [4] and on preserving the power balance due to the intermittent operation of the RESs [3, 4]. Furthermore, other ancillary functions of the energy storage may include the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability, load leveling, peak shaving and operating reserve [3, 5]. When the microgrid is comprised of RESs and energy storage systems in island operation mode, the energy storage usually acts as <b>grid-forming</b> source and regulates the common AC bus appropriately, while the RESs are controlled to inject the available power to the microgrid [6]. However, this approach may lead the SoC to unsafe operation, provoking a damage in the energy storage. Furthermore, an active power imbalance among the generation and the consumption may deteriorate the microgrid frequency regulation [7]. Therefore, the control strategy should take into account the SoC control, ensuring a prolonged lifetime for the battery.|$|E

Since almost all real clocks exhibit drifts, this applies in particular to networks composed of several individual units, each of which being operated with its individual clock. In the present paper, we demonstrate via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range that clock drifts may impair frequency synchronization in low-inertia power systems. The experiments also show that-in {{the absence of a}} common clock-the standard model of an inverter as an ideal voltage source does not capture this phenomenon. As a consequence, we derive a suitably modified model of an inverter-interfaced unit that incorporates the phenomenon of clock drifts. By using the derived model, we investigate the effects of clock drifts on the performance of droop-controlled <b>grid-forming</b> inverters with regard to frequency synchronization and active power sharing.

40|$|Abstract [...] Microgrids {{are highly}} {{compatible}} with photovoltaic (PV) sources {{because of their}} ability to internally aggregate and balance multiple PV sources without imposing restrictions on the penetration of such intermittent power sources. There are two major types of inverter control configurations that are used in photovoltaic inverters to provide an interface to a CERTS microgrid. These control configurations exhibit important duality characteristics, and both are capable of tracking maximum input power while abiding by the CERTS droop algorithms. This paper investigates and demonstrates the comparative performance characteristics of these two major controller types: 1) a gridforming droop-style controller similar to those used for controlling distributed generators; and 2) a current-regulated grid-follower controller. It is shown that only the <b>grid-forming</b> controller allows a PV source to operate alone in an islanded CERTS microgrid, but the grid-follower controller enjoys some inherent advantages with regard to faster dynamic response.

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} a new {{approach}} to synchronization of coupled oscillators. In contrast to the celebrated Kuramoto model we do not work in polar coordinates and do not consider oscillations of fixed magnitude. We propose a synchronizing feedback based on relative state information and local measurements that induces consensus-like dynamics. We show that, under a mild stability condition, the combination of the synchronizing feedback with a decentralized magnitude control law renders the oscillators' almost globally asymptotically stable with respect to set-points for the phase shift, frequency, and magnitude. We apply these result to rigorously solve an open problem in control of inverter-based AC power systems. In this context, the proposed control strategy can be implemented using purely local information, induces a <b>grid-forming</b> behavior, and ensures that a network of AC power inverters is almost globally asymptotically stable with respect to a pre-specified solution of the AC power-flow equations. Moreover, we show that the controller exhibits a droop-like behavior around the standard operating point thus making it backward-compatible with the existing power system operation...|$|E

40|$|Ideally, diesel hybrid {{autonomous}} {{power systems}} would operate with high penetration {{of renewable energy}} sources such as wind and photovoltaic to minimize fuel consumption. However, since these are inherently intermittent and fluctuating, the <b>grid-forming</b> diesel engine generator sets are usually required to operate with larger amounts of spinning reserve, often at low loading conditions what tends to increases operating and maintenance costs. Frequency stability is of great concern in “small” systems, such as mini-grids, where any individual generator in-feed represents {{a substantial portion of}} the total demand.

40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{environmental}} goals set by many governments, an increasing amount of renewable energy, often delivered by distributed-generation (DG) units, is {{injected into the}} electrical power system. Despite the many advantages of DG, {{this can lead to}} voltage problems, especially in times of a high local generation and a low local load. The traditional solution is to invest in more and stronger lines, which could lead to massive investments to cope with the huge rise of DG connection. Another common solution is to include hard curtailment; thus, ON-OFF control of DG units. However, hard curtailment potentially leads to ON-OFF oscillations of DG and a high loss of the available renewable energy as storage is often not economically viable. To cope with these issues, applying a <b>grid-forming</b> control in grid-connected DG units is studied in this paper. The voltage-based droop control that was originally developed for power sharing in islanded microgrids, enables an effective way for soft curtailment without communication. The power changes of the renewable energy sources are delayed to more extreme voltages compared to those of the dispatchable units. This restricts the renewable energy loss and avoids ON-OFF oscillations...|$|E
30|$|Proper {{control is}} a {{precondition}} for microgrids’ stable and efficient operation. The detailed control requirements come from different aspects, such as voltage and frequency regulation, power flow optimization etc. Since these requirements are of different importance and time scale, a three-level microgrid control structure is proposed in [6]. As the foundation of microgrid control system, the primary {{control is a}}imed at maintaining the basic operation of the microgrid without communication, {{which has become a}} hot research topic recently. Since most micro-sources utilize inverters to convert electrical energy, the primary control is essentially the management of power inverters. Micro-source inverters are required to work in a coordinated manner based only on local measurements and the control strategies decide the roles of each micro-source. According to the principle of master–slave control, the micro-source inverters can be divided into grid-feeding, <b>grid-forming,</b> and PQ-droop grid-supporting inverters. From the perspective of peer control, the ωU-droop grid-supporting invertershelp to realize microgrids’ plug and play function. Although being widely discussed in the technical literatures, it still lacks a sufficient practical control method andexisting control technologies need to be further studied and improved. This paper describes the control principles of several typical micro-source inverters and compares their characteristics so as to provide a fundamental understanding of microgrids’ primary control.|$|E

They can support the grid in terms of demand response, power quality, ride through capability, and at the same time, they can ensure electrical continuity to the loads, even in case of grid failure. This paper describes a simple and effective approach to manage microgrids by synergistic control of the power electronic interfaces acting therein, i. e., the utility interface (UI), installed at the point of common coupling with the utility and the energy gateways (EGs), interfacing the DERs with the distribution grid. The proposed master-slave control uses the UI as control master for the EGs. In grid-connected operation, the UI performs as a grid-supporting unit and dispatches active and reactive power references to the EGs so as to improve energy efficiency and power quality; in islanded operation, the UI performs as a <b>grid-forming</b> voltage source and ensures the power balance by exploiting every power source and energy storage unit available in the microgrid.

Thereby, the different charging modes of the converters, the corresponding power levels, and the infrastructural facilities are discussed. Moreover, Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) operation by means of <b>grid-forming,</b> grid-feeding, and grid-supporting converter functionality is briefly explained, and the input power quality and electromagnetic compatibility requirements are summarized.

40|$|The {{application}} of constant power control and inclusion of energy storage in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy systems {{may increase the}} use of two-stage system structures composed of DC–DC-converter-interfaced PV generator and grid-connected inverter connected in cascade. A typical PV-generator-interfacing DC–DC converter is a boost-power-stage converter. The renewable energy system may operate in three different operation modes—grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting modes. In the last two operation modes, the outmost feedback loops are taken from the input terminal of the associated power electronic converters, which usually does not pose stability problems {{in terms of their}} input sources. In the <b>grid-forming</b> operation mode, the outmost feedback loops have to be connected to the output terminal of the associated power electronic converters, and hence the input terminal will behave as a negative incremental resistor at low frequencies. This property will limit the operation of the PV interfacing converter in either the constant voltage or constant current region of the PV generator for ensuring stable operation. The boost-power-stage converter can be applied as a voltage or current-fed converter limiting the stable operation region accordingly. The investigations of this paper show explicitly that only the voltage-fed mode would provide feasible dynamic and stability properties as a viable interfacing converter...|$|E

Over the last few decades, several factors have dictated a gradual shift from the central-control approach to a more distributed layout where distributed generation (DG) technologies are effectively integrated and not just connected (appended) to the networks; amongst others liberalisation of electricity markets, security and quality of supply and environmental issues. Photovoltaic powered distributed generation (PV-DG), although still having a much lesser impact than other DG technologies, is increasingly being embedded into electricity distribution networks worldwide {{within the framework of}} successful regulatory state and marketing programmes.

Implementation of PSO based intelligent control strategy for the inverters of DG units, showed substantial improvement in the performance of controller in terms of reduced settling time and overshoot in power level along with the significant reduction of the power variation and frequency variation during the transient conditions (change in load and change in solar irradiance of PV units).

40|$|For islanded microgrids, droop-based control {{concepts}} {{have been}} developed both in single and three-phase variants. The three-phase controllers often assume a balanced network, hence, unbalance sharing and/or mitigation remains a challenging issue. Therefore, in this paper, unbalance is considered in a three-phase islanded microgrid where the distributed generation (DG) units are operated by the voltage-based droop (VBD) control. For this purpose, the VBD control, which has been developed for single-phase systems, is extended for three phase application and an additional control loop is added for unbalance mitigation and sharing. The method {{is based on an}} unbalance mitigation scheme by DG units in grid-connected systems, which is altered for usage in <b>grid-forming</b> DG units with droop control. The reaction of the DG units to unbalance is determined by the main parameter of the additional control loop, viz, the distortion damping resistance Rd. The effect of Rd on the unbalance mitigation is studied in this paper, i. e., dependent on Rd, the DG units can be resistive for unbalance (RU) or they can contribute in the weakest phase (CW). The paper shows that the RU method decreases the line losses in the system and achieves better power equalization between the DG unit's phases. However, it leads to a larger voltage unbalance near the loads. The CW method leads to a more uneven power between the DG unit's phases and larger line losses, but a better voltage quality near the load. However, it can negatively affect the stability of the system. In microgrids with multiple DG units, the distortion damping resistance is set such that the unbalanced load can be shared between multiple DG units in an actively controlled manner rather than being determined by the microgrid configuration solely. The unit with the lowest distortion resistance provides relatively more of the unbalanced currents...|$|E
40|$|In diesel-hybrid {{autonomous}} power systems, {{a reduced}} number of diesel generators supply {{the power to}} the load and control {{the frequency of the}} system in isolation from the utility grid. In these type of systems, frequency variations of consequence are more likely to occur than in large interconnected power grids, since they feature a relatively small generation capacity and rapid changes in power demand. If generators are not able to maintain frequency within prescribed operational limits during a transient, the assistance of other components is required in order to avoid major disruptions in the power system. In this thesis the use of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) to support dynamic frequency control in a diesel-hybrid autonomous power system was investigated. The proposed VSM consisted in the control of the grid-interface converter of an energy storage system in order to emulate the inertial response and the damping power of a synchronous generator. Furthermore, the damping function of the proposed VSM used an estimated value of the stabilization frequency of the grid, which allowed it to provide proper damping power when the system operated in frequency droop mode. Theoretical and experimental results showed a satisfactory performance of the proposed VSM, which effectively reduced the frequency nadir in 34 %, on average, for different values of the droop factor of the <b>grid-forming</b> genset. Finally, self-tuning algorithms were designed to find optimal parameters for the VSM in order to minimize the amplitude and rate of change of the frequency variations, and the power flow through the energy storage.
