40|$|The {{atmospheric}} event named <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> {{was first}} proposed by Mazon et al., (2014) after analyzing two rapid advection events of extremely {{warm and dry}} air which affected Barcelona (Spain) on the 27 th August 2010 and Heraklion (Greece) on the 23 rd March 2008. The rapid advection led to an increase of the maximum temperature by more than 5 ºC in both cities. However, none of the two events {{could be classified as}} neither a heat wave nor a heat burst due to a time scale of less than two days (minimum temporal scale for a heat wave) but more than few minutes (temporal scale for a heat burst). This is what motivated the <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> definition. Analogously, the Flash Cold phenomenon was later proposed by Almarza and Cortés (2015). Following the research done by Almarza and Cortés (2015), where the <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> and <b>Flash</b> Cold phenomena along the 20 th century in the Iberian peninsula was analyzed, this paper develops their investigation by extending the analysis to southern, central and northern Europe. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} study how the <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> and <b>Flash</b> Cold phenomena have distributed over Europe between 1900 and 2000. To develop the research, maximum and minimum daily temperature and precipitation data has been used for a total of 26 different meteorological stations across Europe. The paper includes an analysis based on the evolution of <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> and <b>Flash</b> Cold for each station throughout the last century, a study on its seasonal distribution and an analysis to determine if there is any relationship between the evolution in the number of episodes registered of these phenomena, mean temperature and mean precipitation. Finally, the influence of air masses will be assessed and the distribution of different <b>Flash</b> <b>Heat</b> and <b>Flash</b> Cold types over Europe will be quantified. Once all the data processed and analyzed, the conclusions of the research will be presented and future work on this topic will be proposed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{many women are}} unable to breastfeed their children due to disease, malnourishment or lack of time to invest in breastfeeding. In an attempt to address the medical issues this causes, human breast milk banks have been established {{in some of these}} communities and healthy mothers have been encouraged to donate their breast milk for infants who would not otherwise have access to breast milk. Since many of these banks are located in resource limited areas, they often lack proper refrigeration and pasteurization equipment. Improper refrigeration and incomplete pasteurization of donated breast milk often results in the donated breast milk being infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli). Recently, non- governmental organizations such as PATH, a leader in global health innovation, have stepped in to develop simple methods for <b>flash</b> <b>heat</b> pasteurization {{that can be used in}} resource limited areas without current equipment. However, there is no existing way to ensure that breast milk has been pasteurized properly by <b>flash</b> <b>heat</b> pasteurization. Thus, there is an immediate need for a sensor that can detect pathogenic E. coli bacteria in the breast milk after this pasteurization. The objective of our project is to design an economical paper-based microfluidic sensor that tests for levels of E. coli in donated breast milk.

30|$|Thermal {{analysis}} {{has been used}} three times on past Mars missions (one instrument on each Viking lander, one on the Phoenix lander) and is currently {{being used by the}} Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on board the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) which landed on Mars in August 2012. Each Viking lander carried a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) that <b>flash</b> <b>heated</b> a sample to release volatile compounds. Although the Viking ovens <b>flash</b> <b>heated</b> samples to 50, 200, 350, and 500 °C, giving some information regarding when various gases evolved, a direct line from the oven to the mass spec was removed to reduce complexity and cost. This greatly limited information about the evolution temperatures of detected gases and consequently, although CO 2 was detected by both landers that could have been due to the decomposition of carbonates, a definitive identification could not be made [10]. Because of these limitations, the experimental conditions used in our work are chosen to more closely approximate the TEGA and SAM instruments and will be most useful in analyzing data from those instruments.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine whether}} faults can be {{lubricated}} by preexisting and newly formed nanoparticles, we perform high-velocity friction experiments on periclase (MgO) nanoparticles and on bare surfaces of Carrara marble cylinders/slices, respectively. Variable temperature conditions were simulated by using host blocks of different thermal conductivities. When temperature rises are relatively low, we observe high friction in nano-MgO tests and unexpected slip strengthening following initial weakening in marble slice tests, {{suggesting that the}} dominant weakening mechanisms are of thermal origin. Solely the rolling of nanoparticles without significant temperature rise is insufficient to cause dynamic fault weakening. For nano-MgO experiments, comprehensive investigations suggest that <b>flash</b> <b>heating</b> {{is the most likely}} weakening mechanism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a new method for thermal nondestructive evaluation. This method uses a synchronized electronic shutter system (SESS) to remove the heat lamp's influence on the thermal data during and after <b>flash</b> <b>heating.</b> There are two main concerns when using <b>flash</b> <b>heating.</b> The first concern is during the flash when the photons are reflected back into the camera. This tends to saturate the detectors and potentially introduces unknown and uncorrectable errors when curve fitting the data to a model. To address this, an electronically controlled shutter was placed over the infrared camera lens. Before firing the flash lamps, the shutter is opened to acquire the necessary background data for offset calibration. During <b>flash</b> <b>heating,</b> the shutter is closed to prevent the photons from the high intensity flash from saturating the camera's detectors. The second concern is after the <b>flash</b> <b>heating</b> where the lamps radiate heat after firing. This residual cooling introduces an unwanted transient thermal response into the data. To remove this residual effect, a shutter was placed over the flash lamps to block the infrared heat radiating from the flash head after heating. This helped to remove the transient contribution of the flash. The flash lamp shutters were synchronized electronically with the camera shutter. Results are given comparing the use of the thermal inspection with and without the shutter system.

40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>heating</b> and {{weakening}} {{could operate}} during earthquake nucleation and propagation. We performed 27 friction experiments in a compression-torsion apparatus on ring-shaped limestone samples at sub-seismic to seismic slip rates 340 mm/s, centimetric displacements and normal stresses of 8 MPa. Friction decreases dramatically at slip rates of 50 e 150 mm/s. Flash weakening was contemporaneous with a peripheral temperature rise of w 90 C measured with an infrared camera. The peripheral temperature yields a lower {{limit to the}} slipping zone temperature. The decrease in friction may result from weakening of the asperity contacts due to decarbonation of calcite induced by (1) <b>flash</b> <b>heating</b> or (2) mechanically-activated reactions. However, X-Ray powder diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy analyses do not reveal the presence of decarbonation products in the slipping zone. Instead, White Light Interferometry and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope observations reveal {{the presence of a}} smooth sliding surface made of nanometric-particles. The mechanical data can be fit by the rate- and state-dependent friction model or by a quadratic model (the latter proposed for powder lubrication).

40|$|The {{utilization}} of carbonized wood biomass has recently received fresh impetus {{owing to the}} vast amount of waste wood {{that has to be}} recycled without posing an environmental hazard. In particular, the use of carbonized wood biomass as a source of advanced carbon materials is been gaining considerable attention because of its high porosity and surface area. However, shape-controllability and pore distributions ofporous carbon materials are also very important factors that determine its practical utility in industrial production [1, 2].
