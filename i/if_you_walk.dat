Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do anything <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows.

Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E
2500|$|A notable North Campus fixture is the {{cast-iron}} gateway {{that stands}} at its main entrance. Known as [...] "The Arch" [...] (but often erroneously pluralized to [...] "The Arches"), the structure was patterned after the Seal of the State of Georgia, and has faced historic downtown Athens ever {{since it was}} erected in the 1850s. Although the Seal's three pillars represent the state's three branches of government, the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the Georgia Constitution's three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal. There is a superstition about walking through The Arch. It is said that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> under The Arch as an undergraduate student, you will not graduate from the University of Georgia on time. Another legend claims that should you walk through The Arch as a freshman, you will become sterile. The steps lining The Arch are noticeably worn due to students avoiding walking under The Arch.|$|E

[...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> directly through the mandapa, you pass through Swagata Nilaya - welcome abode and [...] reach another structure(Atma Purna Nivas) used for meditations and prayer meetings. [...] Then comes the residences for inamates like Dasavatara cottages, Star shaped Buildings, pyramidal buildings, Om Building, Yin Yang and the 24 hermitages.
