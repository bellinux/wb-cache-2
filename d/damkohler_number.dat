A reduced chemical mechanism, which includes the soot precursor naphthalene, and a high-order method of moments are employed. At the highest <b>Damköhler</b> <b>number,</b> local extinction is negligible, while flames holes are observed in the two lowest <b>Damköhler</b> <b>number</b> cases. Compared to temperature and other species controlled by fuel oxidation chemistry, naphthalene {{is found to be}} affected more significantly by the <b>Damköhler</b> <b>number.</b> Consequently, the overall soot mass fraction decreases by more than one order of magnitude for a fourfold decrease of the <b>Damköhler</b> <b>number.</b> On the contrary, the overall number density of soot particles is approximately the same, but its distribution in mixture fraction space is different in the three cases. The total soot mass growth rate is found to be proportional to the <b>Damköhler</b> <b>number.</b> In the two lowest Da number cases, soot leakage across the flame is observed. Leveraging Lagrangian statistics, it is concluded that soot leakage is due to patches of soot that cross the stoichiometric surface through flame holes.

The background flow induces enhancedmixing, and therefore reaction, through interfacial shear. Hence the coupling of fluid flow with chemical reactionsis pivotal in understanding and quantifying effective reaction kinetics in reaction fronts. While this problem hasbeen addressed in the limit of fast reactions (e. g. de Simoni 2005, Le Borgne 2014), in natural systems reactionscan span a large range of <b>Damköhler</b> <b>numbers</b> since their characteristic reaction times vary over a large range oftypical values.

We observe three distinct regimes, each of themcharacterized by different scalings of the global production rate and width of the reactive zone.

40|$|The {{matrix of}} {{crystalline}} rocks is typically constituted by mineral grains with characteristic sizes that vary from mm-scale (or less) up to cm-scale. These mineral grains are separated and intersected by micro-fractures, which build the so-called inter-granular space. Here, {{we present a}} generic model of the crystalline rock matrix, which is built upon a micro-Discrete Fracture Network (micro-DFN). To mimic the multiscale nature of grains and inter-granular space, different sets of micro-fractures are employed, each having a different length interval and intensity. The occurrence of these fracture sets is described by Poisson distributions, while the fracture aperture in these sets defines the porosity of the rock matrix. The proposed micro-DFN model is tested and calibrated against experimental observations from Forsmark (Sweden) and the resulting system is used to carry out numerical experiments aimed at assessing the redox buffering capacity of the heterogeneous crystalline rock matrix against the infiltration of glacial oxygenated melt-water. The chemically reactive mineral considered {{in this study is}} biotite, whose distribution is simulated with a single stochastic realization that honors the average abundance and grain size observed in mineralogical studies of Forsmark. The exposed surface area of biotite grains, which provide a source of ferrous ions that are in turn oxidized by the dissolved oxygen, is related to the underlying micro-DFN. The results of the mechanistic reactive transport simulations are compared to an existing analytical solution based on the assumption of homogeneity. This evaluation shows that the matrix indeed behaves as a composite system, with most of the oxygen being consumed in “highly reactive pathways” and a non negligible part of the oxygen diffuses deeper into the matrix.
