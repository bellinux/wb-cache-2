40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of positive magnetization on field cooling (PMFC) in low applied magnetic fields (H≤ 100 Oe) in a single crystal of Ca 3 Rh 4 Sn 13 near its superconducting transition temperature (Tc≈ 8. 35 K). For 30 Oe ≤H≤ 100 Oe, the PMFC response crosses over to a diamagnetic response as the temperature is lowered below 8 K. For 100 Oe ≤H≤ 300 Oe, the diamagnetic response undergoes an unexpected reversal in its field dependence above a characteristic temperature (designated as TVL*= 7. 9 K), where <b>the</b> field-cooled <b>cool-down</b> magnetization <b>curves</b> intersect. <b>The</b> in-phase and out-of-phase ac susceptibility data confirm {{the change in the}} superconducting state across TVL*. We ascribe the PMFC response to a compression of magnetic flux caused by the nucleation of superconductivity at the surface of the sample. In very low fields (H≤ 20 Oe), the PMFC response has an interesting oscillatory behavior, which persists up to about 7 K. The oscillatory nature underlines the interplay between competing responses contributing to the magnetization signal in the PMFC regime. We believe that the (i) counterintuitive field dependence of the diamagnetic response for H≥ 100 Oe and above TVL* (lasting up to Tc), (ii) the oscillatory character in the PMFC response at low fields, and (iii) the PMFC peaks near 8. 2 K in 30 Oe ≤H≤ 100 Oe provide support in favor of a theoretical scenario based on the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The scenario predicts the possibility of complex magnetic fluctuations associated with transformation between different metastable giant vortex states prior to transforming into the conventional vortex state as the sample is cooled below TVL...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe failure {{probabilities of}} the reactor {{pressure}} vessel (RPV) for low temperature over-pressurization (LTOP) and cool-down transients are calculated in this study. For <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> transient, a pressure–temperature limit curve is generated in accordance with Section XI, Appendix G of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code, from which safety margin factors are deliberately removed for the probabilistic fracture mechanics analysis. Then, sensitivity analyses are conducted to understand the effects of some input parameters. For the LTOP transient, {{the failure of the}} RPV mostly occurs during the period of the abrupt pressure rise. For <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> transient, <b>the</b> decrease of the fracture toughness with temperature and time plays a main role in RPV failure at the end of <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> process. As expected, the failure probability increases with increasing fluence, Cu and Ni contents, and initial reference temperature-nil ductility transition (RTNDT). The effect of warm prestressing on the vessel failure probability for LTOP is not significant because most of the failures happen before the stress intensity factor reaches the peak value while its effect reduces the failure probability by more than one order of magnitude for <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> transient...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} whether 20 min cool-down exercise performed on an ergometer cycle immediately after eccentric exercise of knee extensors would reduce delayed onset of muscle soreness and maximal isometric force loss. Methods: Twenty-four volunteers, (14 woman and 10 men) were randomly assigned into two groups: a “cool- down” group and a “control” group, i. e., each group consisted of 12 volunteers (7 woman and 5 men). Maximal voluntary isometric contraction force (MVC) in knee extensors, pressure pain threshold (PPT) along the rectus femoris muscle and subjective rating of pain intensity in thigh muscles were obtained before eccentric exercise (baseline), and 24 and 48 hours after eccentric exercise. Subjects in <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> group completed 20 min exercise on an ergometer cycle (60 - 70 % of HRmax) immediately after the eccentric exercise. Subjects {{in the control group}} did not receive any interventions. Results: A significant group by time interaction from baseline to 48 hours after the eccentric exercise were found for PPT in the distal portion of rectus femoris (P =. 047). For both groups, PPT at the distal part of the muscle decreased from day 1 to day 3; however, the reduction was substantially higher for the control group (23. 3 %) compared to <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> group (9. 6 %). A tendency for a group by time interaction from baseline to both 24 and 48 hours after eccentric exercise was found for MVC (P =. 06). For both groups the mean force was lower on day 2 and 3 compared to baseline; however, the reduction in force for both comparisons was higher for the control group (22. 5 %, 20. 4 %) compared to <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> group (9. 7 %, 8. 2 %).

40|$|Many next-generation, high-gradient {{accelerator}} applications, from energy-recovery linacs to accelerator-driven systems (ADS) rely on {{continuous wave}} (CW) operation for which superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) systems are the enabling technology. However, while SRF cavities dissipate little power, {{they must be}} cooled by liquid helium and for many CW accelerators the complexity {{as well as the}} investment and operating costs of the cryoplant can prove to be prohibitive. We investigated ways to reduce the dynamic losses by improving the residual resistance (R_{res}) of niobium cavities. Both the material treatment and the magnetic shielding are known to have an impact. In addition, we found that R_{res} can be reduced significantly when <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> conditions during <b>the</b> superconducting phase transition of the niobium are optimized. We believe that not only do <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> conditions impact <b>the</b> level to which external magnetic flux is trapped in the cavity but also that thermoelectric currents are generated which in turn create additional flux that can be trapped. Therefore, we investigated the generation of flux and the dynamics of flux trapping and release in a simple model niobium-titanium system that mimics an SRF cavity in its helium tank. We indeed found that thermal gradients along the system during the superconducting transition can generate a thermoelectric current and magnetic flux, which subsequently can be trapped. These effects may explain the observed variation of the cavity’s R_{res} with cool-down conditions...|$|R

40|$|During <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> of a superconducting {{accelerating}} cavity, {{a magnetic}} flux is trapped as quantized vortices, which yield additional dissipation {{and contribute to}} the residual resistance. Recently, cooling down with a large spatial temperature gradient attracts much attention for successful reductions of trapped vortices. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a model to explain the observed efficient flux expulsions and the role of spatial temperature gradient during <b>the</b> <b>cool-down</b> of cavity. In the vicinity of a region with a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc,the critical fields are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic field. A region with a lower critical field smaller than the ambient field is in the vortex state. As a material is cooled down, a region with a temperature close Tc associating the vortex state domain sweeps and passes through the material. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are trapped by pinning centers that randomly distribute in the material. A number of trapped vortices can be naively estimated by using the analogy with the beam-target collision event. Based on this result, the residual resistance is evaluated. We find that a number of trapped vortices and the residual resistance are proportional to the strength of the ambient magnetic field and the inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained residual resistance agrees well with experimental results. A material property dependence of a number of trapped vortices is also discussed. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
