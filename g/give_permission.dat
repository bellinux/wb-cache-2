5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched {{and the other half}} is found there.|$|E
5|$|Ferry {{implementation}} required {{permission from}} several entities. Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT {{was required to}} approve a new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was supposed to give NYC Ferry permission to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Karan Soni portrays Dopinder, a {{taxi driver}} who befriends Deadpool, and Jed Rees portrays a {{recruiter}} for Ajax. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> {{for him to be}} used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead explained as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and is seen in the film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E

5|$|In 1776, Indians at the Bahia {{missions}} {{told the}} soldiers that the Karankawas had massacred {{a group of}} Europeans who had been shipwrecked {{near the mouth of}} the Guadalupe River. After finding the remains of an English commercial frigate, the soldiers warned the Karankawa to refrain from attacking seamen. The soldiers continued to explore the coast, and reported that foreign powers could easily build a small settlement on the barrier islands, which were difficult to access from the mainland, and then ascend the Trinity or San Jacinto Rivers into the heart of Texas. Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the barrier islands and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, declined to <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} after the fire, there were {{considerable}} efforts to assign and avoid blame {{on the part of the}} band, the nightclub owners, the manufacturers and distributors of the foam material and pyrotechnics, and the concert promoters.

25|$|For the 1924 Everest {{expedition}} Morshead was {{not considered}} able to participate as a climber because of his injuries but he was offered the role of base camp and transport officer. He had to turn this down because his employers would not <b>give</b> <b>permission,</b> even for unpaid leave. However, in the 1924 Olympic Games medals were awarded for mountaineering and Morshead received a special medal awarded to the climbers on the 1922 expedition.|$|E

25|$|After this news, the MSJ {{athletic}} department approached its counterpart at Hiram. The two teams had initially planned {{to open their}} respective seasons on November 15 at Hiram's Price Gymnsaium, but Hiram agreed to move the game to November 1 at MSJ if the NCAA would <b>give</b> <b>permission.</b> This was needed because under NCAA rules, Division III schools cannot play regular-season games before November 15. The NCAA ultimately granted the schools a waiver to play on November 2.|$|E

25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are.

The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|E
25|$|Staying at the Tuzla Camp during {{summers and}} at the Gedikpaşa Orphanage during winters, Rakel learned Turkish and Armenian, and {{finished}} primary school. Because Rakel was registered as a Turk, not as an Armenian, she {{was not allowed to}} enroll at Armenian community schools and her father did not <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for her to attend a Turkish school past then-compulsory 5th grade. Not able to obtain further formal schooling, Rakel was privately tutored by instructors at the Gedikpaşa Orphanage.|$|E
25|$|The {{institution}} of the Arctic Star has been controversial, {{since it is the}} first British medal to be instituted and awarded using a dead monarch's cypher or effigy, who did not <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for it to be instituted. The medal has also been criticised by other groups, who maintain that the veterans of the convoys had already been amply rewarded with medals for this campaign, and they should not have received special treatment over other veterans who have been denied similar recognition.|$|E

Construction 0was completed in 2007 and the terminal opened on 21 January 2008 Both the terminal and the double track were to use the newly developed signaling system Merkur, but the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate would not <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for the system to be installed. Because of this, the signaling system at the terminal is operated manually and therefore cannot be used with full capacity.|$|E
25|$|In July 1770, {{the merchants}} of New York City decided to resume trade with Britain when news arrived of Parliament's plan {{to repeal the}} Townshend Duties and to <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for New York to issue some paper currency. The Sons of Liberty were {{strongly}} opposed to the resumption of trade. The merchants twice polled their members and went door to door polling residents of New York City and all polls were overwhelming in support of resumption of trade. This was perhaps the first public opinion poll in American history.|$|E
25|$|Güshi Khan's {{attack on}} the Tsangpa was made on the orders of Sonam Rapten while being {{publicly}} and robustly opposed by the Dalai Lama, who, {{as a matter of}} conscience, out of compassion and his vision of tolerance for other religious schools, refused to <b>give</b> <b>permission</b> for more warfare in his name after the defeat of the Beri king. Sonam Rabten deviously went behind his master's back to encourage Güshi Khan, to facilitate his plans and to ensure the attacks took place; for this defiance of his master's wishes, Rabten was severely rebuked by the 5th Dalai Lama.|$|E
