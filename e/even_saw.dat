5|$|Marilyn J. Matelski cites Mavis and Derek Wilton as {{examples}} of clever naming, in that the serial had created a fitting image of the characters before viewers <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> them together.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
50|$|The Lightning {{match of}} the <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> Toscano defeat Ephesto {{in just over}} 7 minutes, {{potentially}} setting Toscano up as a challenger for the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship that Ephesto holds. The third match of the <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> the thrown together team of El Sagrado, Valiente and Metro beat the experienced Poder Mexica team (Sangre Azteca, Misterioso II and Dragón Rojo, Jr.) two falls to one.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that the}} national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, instead of focusing upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units {{with a view to}} service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia's military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF in order to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government's decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division's experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units in order to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> combat.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July, the Camp David 2000 Summit convened, {{although}} the Palestinians considered the summit premature. They <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> it as a trap. The summit ended on 25 July, without an agreement being reached. At its conclusion, a Trilateral Statement was issued defining the agreed principles to guide future negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, it {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} uniformity and cohesion; the Regia Marina was a heterogeneous mix of equipment, standards and practice, and <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> hostility between the officers from the various former navies. These problems were compounded by the continuation of separate officer schools at Genoa and Naples, and were not fully addressed until the opening of a unified Naval Academy at Livorno in 1881.|$|E
60|$|The news {{reached the}} ears of Dame Toelast. The same <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> her seated in the inglenook {{opposite}} Nicholas Snyders, who smoked and seemed bored.|$|R

60|$|Eight o'clock that <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> {{the three}} Rovers {{on their way}} to Hope Seminary. Tom was the leader, and it had taken a good half hour's arguing on his part to get Dick and Sam to {{accompany}} him.|$|R
25|$|The {{end of the}} Severan dynasty {{marked the}} {{breakdown}} of central imperium. Against a background of economic hyperinflation and latterly, endemic plague, rival provincial claimants fought for supremacy and failing this, {{set up their own}} provincial Empires. Most Emperors seldom <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> Rome, and had only notional relationships with their senates. In the absence of coordinated Imperial military response, foreign peoples seized the opportunity for invasion and plunder.|$|E
25|$|Edwards {{recovered}} it on {{its first}} bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched {{into the end zone}} for a 19–17 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from the stands and the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Blessed Hildegard Burjan (30 January 1883 – 11 June 1933) - born Hildegard Lea Freund - was a German Roman Catholic convert from Judaism and {{the founder}} of the Sisterhood of Caritas Socialis.

50|$|On January 4 the Q's {{opened the}} new year in front of 2,101 fans but lost to the San Antonio Spurs 112-105. The next <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> a loss on the road at Denver; the Rockets prevailed 146-122 as Warren Jabali dished 19 assists in front of 6,183 spectators. The next <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> the Conquistadors lose a home game in front of 1,329 fans to the Carolina Cougars, 120-109; Mack Calvin scored 29 points and Caldwell Jones tied an ABA record with 12 blocked shots.

On January 13 Bo Lamar scored a game-high 50 points as San Diego won on its home court 141-130 against the Indiana Pacers; attendance was 1,386 for the game. January 16 saw a road loss to the Virginia Squires despite Bo Lamar's 28 points.|$|R

25|$|After 2006, Bhumibol {{suffered}} declining {{health and}} spent extended periods at Siriraj Hospital, {{where he died}} on 13 October 2016. He was generally highly revered by the people in Thailand – many <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> him as close to divine. Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced into exile or to suffer frequent imprisonments. His cremation was held on 26 October 2017 at the royal crematorium at Sanam Luang.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all of Kokusai Green's {{investment}} in the team and the Ice Palace {{came in the form}} of loans, leaving the team constantly short of cash. At least one prospective buyer pulled out after expressing doubts that Okubo even existed. In fact, the first time anyone connected with the Lightning or the NHL <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> Okubo was in the spring of 1998. Many of Esposito's trades came simply to keep the team above water. The team's financial situation was a considerable concern to NHL officials; rumors surfaced that the league was seriously considering taking control of the team if Okubo failed to find a buyer by the summer of 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII {{attempted}} to allow appeals to Rome against the Inquisition, but Ferdinand in December 1484 {{and again in}} 1509 decreed death and confiscation for anyone trying {{to make use of}} such procedures without royal permission. With this, the Inquisition became the only institution that held authority across all the realms of the Spanish monarchy and, in all of them, a useful mechanism at the service of the crown. However, the cities of Aragón continued resisting, and <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> revolt, as in Teruel from 1484 to 1485. However, the murder of Inquisidor Pedro Arbués in Zaragoza on September 15, 1485, caused public opinion to turn against the conversos and in favour of the Inquisition. In Aragón, the Inquisitorial courts were focused specifically on members of the powerful converso minority, ending their influence in the Aragonese administration.|$|E

25|$|The {{operations}} of the Pharaoh Thutmose III gives evidence of Egyptian sophistication. At the Battle of Megiddo, in present-day Jordan, Syrian troops deployed {{in front of the}} city. Thutmose first sent the left wing of his force northwest of Megiddo, to cut off the Syrian line of retreat. He redeployed his right wing south of the city, and concentrated his powerful strike force of chariots, over 1,000 of them in the center. The chariots smashed the right flank of the Syrian formation and the Egyptian infantry, coming up fast, waded into the fray with javelin, sword and battle-axe. The Syrians army crumbled. Such successes were to continue as the improved Egyptian forces grew in power and influence throughout the region. The rise of Persia saw the conquest of the Egyptian state and the end of its independent military activity, however Egyptian forces, including the Nubian bowmen, still continued to make their mark as part of the Persian army, and <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> action against Alexander the Great at Issus, circa 333BC.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the players}} of the 1970s and 1980s {{generation}} also rate Thomson as the fastest they ever faced or <b>even</b> <b>saw.</b> West Indian batting legend Viv Richards, rates Thomson as the fastest he has ever faced. Richards' opinion counts for a lot, as he faced almost all the fastest bowlers of all time through the 1970s and 1980s in John Snow, Dennis Lillee, Andy Roberts, Imran Khan, Michael Holding, Sylvester Clarke, Wayne Daniel, Malcolm Marshall, Patrick Patterson, Alan Ward, Len Pascoe, Garth Le Roux, Graham Dilley etc, and even Devon Malcolm and Waqar Younis in the early 1990s, at various levels, in International matches, the WSC, and the Caribbean, Australian and England County leagues. Indian batting great Sunil Gavaskar also reckons Thomson was the fastest he faced over a career spanning over 20 years. Former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd regards Thomson as the fastest bowler he has ever seen. Michael Holding, himself often considered an extremely fast bowler in his prime, believes Thomson to be the fastest he ever saw. Geoffrey Boycott rates Thomson joint fastest with Michael Holding among all the bowlers that he has seen. Martin Crowe, who faced many of the fastest of the mid and late 1980s, and Allan Donald, Waqar Younis and Devon Malcolm at their quickest in the early 1990s, rates Thomson as the fastest he ever faced (followed by Michael Holding), though he faced Thomson only in 1982 early in his own career, when Thomson was three years away from retirement from international cricket.|$|E
500|$|Years later Trương would recall {{just how}} [...] "close [...] were to annihilating or {{capturing}} {{the core of}} the Southern resistance – elite units of our frontline fighters along with the civilian and much of the military leadership". After many days of hard marches the PRG reached the northern bases, and relative safety, in the Kratie region. Casualties were light and the march <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> the birth of a baby to Dương Quỳnh Hoa, the deputy minister of health in the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG). The column needed many days to recover and Trương himself would require weeks to recover from the long march.|$|E

50|$|Earlier in the day, South Fremantle {{also won}} the {{reserves}} grand final, defeating West Perth. South Fremantle's Hayden North, who was surprisingly {{left out of the}} league team, won the Merv McIntosh Medal as the best player.

500|$|Unlike many landowners who {{approved}} of child labour and opposed Peel's {{repeal of the}} Corn Laws, Albert supported moves to raise working ages and free up trade. In 1846, Albert was rebuked by Lord George Bentinck when he attended {{the debate on the}} Corn Laws in the House of Commons to give tacit support to Peel. During Peel's premiership, Albert's authority behind, or beside, the throne became more apparent. He had access to all the Queen's papers, was drafting her correspondence and was present when she met her ministers, or <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> them alone in her absence. The clerk of the Privy Council, Charles Greville, wrote of him: [...] "He is King to all intents and purposes." ...|$|E
500|$|Huff began {{platooning}} {{in right}} field with Schierholtz (and later, with Andrés Torres) {{at the beginning of}} July, and Ishikawa got the starts at first base when Huff was {{in right field}}. On July 3, Ishikawa hit his first career grand slam against Ubaldo Jiménez (who had a 141 record at the time) in an 118 victory over Colorado. Ishikawa hit [...]290 with two home runs and 17 RBI in 36 games from July 1 through August 13, and he <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> his season batting average go over [...]300 at times during the stretch. However, the acquisition of José Guillén on August 13 moved Huff back to first base, which returned Ishikawa to a utility role. Giants' manager Bruce Bochy said, [...] "'s done a nice job." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never <b>even</b> <b>saw</b> each other. I mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{match of}} the <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> Jack Swagger defend the ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The match started with both wrestlers {{countering}} each other's moves until Swagger injured Hardy's left shoulder and then targeted {{it for the}} rest of the match. Swagger ultimately defeated Hardy by pinning him after slamming him to the mat with a gutwrench powerbomb. Swagger thus retained the ECW title.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of how the riots began. One is that some Ghansoli agri forcibly applied Holi colours on a mathadi youth (in some sub-versions, a girl), resulting in a scuffle in the afternoon. Another version is that some agri harassed a mathadi girl. The <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> invasions by both sides on each other's colonies, {{as well as a}} road blockade by the mathadi.|$|R
60|$|Then {{rang out}} a shout which seemed {{actually}} {{to rock the}} building to and fro, {{and by the time}} the tumult had subsided the guest of the <b>evening</b> <b>saw</b> a long table, on either side of which were seated all his friends and acquaintances among the sidewalk merchants, while at the head 'Lish Davis, Jerry Walters, and Joe Black presided with as much gravity as if it had been the swellest of swell functions.|$|R
