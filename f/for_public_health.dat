He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule.

5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> {{did not keep}} pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, {{pointing out that the}} U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.

5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern <b>for</b> <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and safety.
