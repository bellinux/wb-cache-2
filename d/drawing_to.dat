5|$|During {{these past}} few days the devious {{processes}} whereunder the political independence and territorial integrity of the three small Baltic Republics – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were to be deliberately annihilated by one of their more powerful neighbors, have been rapidly <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> their conclusion.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1865 Selfe gave regular classes in {{mechanical}} <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> tradesmen at the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts in Pitt Street. Selfe's class in mechanical drawing {{was the first}} technical, vocational offering at the School of Arts, and its popularity led {{to the introduction of}} other practical subjects.|$|E

5|$|Marcinkus {{arrived in}} France in mid-March 1940 and {{immediately}} requested acceptance into the French Air Force. Bureaucratic delays hindered his enlistment. By the time these hurdles were cleared, the Battle for France was rapidly <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close. It is possible, however, that Marcinkus succeeded in shooting down several German military planes during his short {{career in the}} French air force.|$|E
5|$|The Great Red Spot, a {{prominent}} oval-shaped {{feature in the}} southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The first 14 {{picks in}} the draft belonged to teams that had missed the playoffs; the order was {{determined}} through a lottery. The lottery determined the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. As it is commonplace {{in the event of}} identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> break the ties on April 18, 2008.|$|E

50|$|The <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> {{split the}} eight teams into Groups A and B was {{conducted}} on January 21st at the Rio Internacional Hotel. Brazil and Argentina were allocated as heads of the two respective groups, with the other six teams then <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> accompany them.|$|R
50|$|Western Sydney Wanderers and Central Coast Mariners both {{entered the}} {{competition}} {{directly into the}} group stage, being <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Groups H and F respectively. Melbourne Victory entered the competition at Round 3 of the qualifying play-off, and beat Muangthong United 2-1 and were <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Group G.|$|R
5|$|The war was now rapidly <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a {{close and}} upon the {{surrender}} of the Japanese Empire in August, Milford was ordered to accept the surrender of the representative commander of the Japanese forces, which numbered around 8,500 troops, in Dutch-Borneo. On 8 September, Milford observed the surrender of the Japanese military governor of the area, Vice Admiral Michiaki Kamada, in a ceremony held aboard HMAS Burdekin which was anchored {{off the coast of}} Dutch Borneo.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of normal}} curling scoring rules, the Elite 10 uses a match play {{system in which}} scoring is based on ends won, rather than rocks scored. An end is won by {{stealing}} or scoring two with the hammer, similar to skins curling. Unlike skins, however, there are no carry-overs. In {{the event of a}} tie, a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button competition is held to determine the winner. In the standings, wins are worth three points, <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button wins are worth two points, and <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button losses are worth one point.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, {{it appeared that}} Garrard's political career was <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on {{his work in the}} Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The keel for U-38 {{was laid}} down on 15 April 1937 and after {{over a year}} and a half of {{construction}} she was commissioned on 24 October 1938 with Oberleutnant zur See Heinrich Liebe in command. Upon commissioning, U-38 was assigned to the 6th U-boat Flotilla. Like U-37, U-38 conducted eleven patrols. During these patrols she managed to sink or damage over 30 enemy vessels. Like U-37, U-38 ranks as one of the most successful U-boats of World War II, holding 10th place. With World War II <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a disastrous close for Germany, U-38 was scuttled by her own crew west of Wesermünde on 5 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{running order}} for the semi-finals was {{released}} on 28 March 2013. The running {{order for the}} final was determined on 17 May 2013. An additional allocation draw occurred for the final with each finalist nation <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> perform either in {{the first or second}} half of the final. The allocation draw for qualifying countries from the semi-finals occurred during the semi-final winners' press conferences following each semi-final, while the allocation draw for the Big Five countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) occurred during their first individual press conferences on 15 May 2013. As the host country, the running order position for Sweden in the final was exclusively determined by a draw during the heads of delegation meeting on 18 March 2013. Sweden was drawn to perform 16th in the final.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid {{of hundreds of thousands of}} American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army. On 3 October, Prince Max of Baden replaced Georg von Hertling as Chancellor of Germany, and immediately asked President Woodrow Wilson to arrange an armistice.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{was assassinated}} by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while {{attending}} a play at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close. The assassination occurred {{five days after}} the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E

5000|$|The Elite 10 event {{features}} what {{is called}} a [...] "match-play" [...] format, in which the winning team of a particular game is the team that has won the most ends in that game. In match play, an end is won by stealing or scoring two with the hammer, similar to skins curling. Unlike skins, however, there are no carry-overs. Tied games will have a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button competition to determine the winner. In the standings, wins are worth three points, <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button wins are worth two points, and <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button losses are worth one point.|$|R
5|$|In {{an effort}} to remedy the {{perceived}} defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 {{and then to the}} Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds a <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by {{the parks and}} recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, as {{the joint}} battles of Meiktila and Mandalay were <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> a close, a conference {{was held at}} Monywa in Burma, {{attended}} by senior Allied military figures including Admiral Lord Mountbatten, {{the commander in chief}} of the Allied South East Asia Command, and General William Slim, commander of Fourteenth Army. The object of the conference was to discuss future Allied strategy in South East Asia in the aftermath of Meiktila and Mandalay, including the reconquest of Burma and the retaking of Malaya and then Singapore. In order to secure these objectives however, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, would have to be captured before the onset of the monsoon rains, which would impede any Allied advance over land; the Allied Chiefs of Staff worked on the assumption that this would occur before June. After Rangoon had fallen, a force of between four and five divisions would be landed in Western Malaya in an operation code-named Zipper, which would itself be followed by Mailfist, the capture of Singapore.|$|E
