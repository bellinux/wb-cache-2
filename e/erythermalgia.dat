40|$|Abstract Hereditary <b>erythermalgia</b> is {{a painful}} and {{debilitating}} genetic disorder associated with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7. We have previously reported a Canadian family segregating <b>erythermalgia</b> consistently with a dominant genetic etiology. Molecular {{analysis of the}} proband from the family detected two different missense mutations in Nav 1. 7. In the present study we have performed a long-term follow-up clinical study of disease progression in three affected family members. A more extensive molecular study has also been completed, analyzing the segregation of the two missense variants in the family. The two variants (P 610 T, L 858 F) segregate independently with respect to clinical presentation. Detailed genotype/phenotype correlation suggests {{that one of the}} two variants (L 858 F) is causal for <b>erythermalgia.</b> The second variant (P 610 T) may modify the phenotype in the proband.

40|$|Disease-producing {{mutations}} of ion {{channels are}} usually characterized as producing hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability. We show here {{that a single}} mutation can produce hyperexcitability in one neuronal cell type and hypoexcitability in another neuronal cell type. We studied the functional effects of a mutation of sodium channel Nav 1. 7 associated with a neuropathic pain syndrome, <b>erythermalgia,</b> within sensory and sympathetic ganglion neurons, two cell types where Nav 1. 7 is normally expressed. Although this mutation depolarizes resting membrane potential in both types of neurons, it renders sensory neurons hyperexcitable and sympathetic neurons hypoexcitable. The selective presence, in sensory but not sympathetic neurons, of the Nav 1. 8 channel, which remains available for activation at depolarized membrane potentials, is {{a major determinant of}} these opposing effects. These results provide a molecular basis for the sympathetic dysfunction that has been observed in <b>erythermalgia.</b> Moreover, these findings show that a single ion channel mutation can produce opposing phenotypes (hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability) in the different cell types in which the channel is expressed...|$|E

40|$|SummaryParoxysmal extreme pain {{disorder}} (PEPD), previously {{known as}} familial rectal pain (FRP, or OMIM 167400), is an inherited condition characterized by paroxysms of rectal, ocular, or submandibular pain with flushing.

Functional analysis in vitro of three of these mutant Nav 1. 7 channels revealed a reduction in fast inactivation, leading to persistent sodium current. Other mutations in SCN 9 A associated with more negative activation thresholds are known to cause primary <b>erythermalgia</b> (PE). Carbamazepine, a drug that is effective in PEPD, but not PE, showed selective block of persistent current associated with PEPD mutants, but {{did not affect the}} negative activation threshold of a PE mutant.

40|$|Abstract. Besides {{initiating}} and propagating action potentials in established neuronal circuits, voltage-dependent sodium channels sculpt and {{bolster the}} functional neuronal network from early in embryonic development through adulthood (e. g., differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into oligodendrocytes, myelinating axon; competition between neighboring equipotential neurites for development {{into a single}} axon; enhancing and opposing functional interactions with attractive and repulsive molecules for axon pathfinding; extending and retracting terminal arborization of axon for correct synapse formation; experience-driven cognition; neuronal survival; and remyelination of demyelinated axons). Surprisingly, different patterns of action potentials direct homeostasis-based epigenetic selection for neurotransmitter phenotype, thus excitability by sodium channels specifying expression of inhibitory neurotransmitters. Mechanisms for these pleiotropic effects of sodium channels include reciprocal interactions between neurons and glia via neurotransmitters, growth factors, and cytokines at synapses and axons. Sodium channelopathies causing pain (e. g., allodynia) and neurodegeneration (e. g., multiple sclerosis) derive from 1) electrophysiological disturbances by insults (e. g., ischemia /hypoxia, toxins, and antibodies); 2) loss-of-physiological function or gain-of-pathological function of mutant sodium channel proteins; 3) spatiotemporal inappropriate expression of normal sodium channel proteins; or 4) de-repressed expression of otherwise silent sodium channel genes. Nav 1. 7 proved to account for pain in human <b>erythermalgia</b> and inflammation, being the convincing molecular target of pain treatment...|$|E
40|$|SCN 9 A encodes the {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} Nav 1. 7, a protein highly expressed in pain-sensing neurons. Mutations in SCN 9 A cause three human pain disorders: bi-allelic {{loss of function}} mutations result in Channelopathy-associated Insensitivity to Pain (CIP), whereas activating mutations cause severe episodic pain in Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder (PEPD) and Primary <b>Erythermalgia</b> (PE). To date, all mutations in SCN 9 A that cause a complete inability to experience pain are protein truncating and presumably lead to no protein being produced. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of two novel non-truncating mutations in families with CIP: a homozygously-inherited missense mutation found in a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family (Nav 1. 7 -R 896 Q) and a five amino acid in-frame deletion found in a sporadic compound heterozygote (Nav 1. 7 -ΔR 1370 -L 1374). Both of these mutations map to the pore region of the Nav 1. 7 sodium channel. Using transient transfection of PC 12 cells we found {{a significant reduction in}} membrane localization of the mutant protein compared to the wild type. Furthermore, voltage clamp experiments of mutant-transfected HEK 293 cells show a complete loss of function of the sodium channel, consistent with the absence of pain phenotype. In summary, this study has identified critical amino acids needed for the normal subcellular localization and function of Nav 1. 7. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{disabling}} {{chronic pain}} syndrome erythromelalgia (also termed <b>erythermalgia)</b> {{is characterized by}} attacks of burning pain in the extremities induced by warmth. Pharmacological treatment is often ineffective, but the pain can be alleviated by cooling of the limbs. Inherited erythromelalgia has recently been linked to mutations in the gene SCN 9 A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7. Nav 1. 7 is preferentially expressed in most nociceptive DRG neurons and in sympathetic ganglion neurons. It has recently been shown that several disease-causing erythromelalgia mutations alter channel-gating behavior {{in a manner that}} increases DRG neuron excitability. Results Here we tested the effects of temperature on gating properties of wild type Nav 1. 7 and mutant L 858 F channels. Whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements on wild type or L 858 F channels expressed in HEK 293 cells revealed that cooling decreases current density, slows deactivation and increases ramp currents for both mutant and wild type channels. However, cooling differentially shifts the midpoint of steady-state activation in a depolarizing direction for L 858 F but not for wild type channels. Conclusion The cooling-dependent shift of the activation midpoint of L 858 F to more positive potentials brings the threshold of activation of the mutant channels closer to that of wild type Nav 1. 7 at lower temperatures, and is likely to contribute to the alleviation of painful symptoms upon cooling in affected limbs in patients with this erythromelalgia mutation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{voltage-gated}} sodium {{channels are}} expressed in complex patterns in mammalian nerve and muscle. Three channels, Nav 1. 7, Nav 1. 8, and Nav 1. 9, are expressed selectively in peripheral damage-sensing neurons. Because there are no selective blockers of these channels, we used gene ablation in mice to examine the function of Nav 1. 7 (PN 1) in pain pathways. A global Nav 1. 7 -null mutant was found to die shortly after birth. We therefore used the Cre-loxP system to generate nociceptor-specific knockouts. Nav 1. 8 is only expressed in peripheral, mainly nociceptive, sensory neurons. We knocked Cre recombinase into the Nav 1. 8 locus to generate heterozygous mice expressing Cre recombinase in Nav 1. 8 -positive sensory neurons. Crossing these animals with mice where Nav 1. 7 exons 14 and 15 were flanked by loxP sites produced nociceptor-specific knockout mice that were viable and apparently normal. These animals showed increased mechanical and thermal pain thresholds. Remarkably, all inflammatory pain responses evoked by a range of stimuli, such as formalin, carrageenan, complete Freund's adjuvant, or nerve growth factor, were reduced or abolished. A congenital pain syndrome in humans recently has been mapped to the Nav 1. 7 gene, SCN 9 A. Dominant Nav 1. 7 mutations lead to edema, redness, warmth, and bilateral pain in human <b>erythermalgia</b> patients, confirming an important role for Nav 1. 7 in inflammatory pain. Nociceptor-specific gene ablation should prove useful in understanding the role of other broadly expressed genes in pain pathways...|$|E
40|$|The gene SCN 9 A is {{responsible}} for three human pain disorders. Nonsense mutations cause a complete absence of pain, whereas activating mutations cause severe episodic pain in paroxysmal extreme pain disorder and primary <b>erythermalgia.</b> This led us to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SCN 9 A were associated with differing pain perception in the general population. We first genotyped 27 SCN 9 A SNPs in 578 individuals with a radiographic diagnosis of osteoarthritis and a pain score assessment. A significant association was found between pain score and SNP rs 6746030; the rarer A allele was associated with increased pain scores compared to the commoner G allele (P = 0. 016). This SNP was then further genotyped in 195 pain-assessed people with sciatica, 100 amputees with phantom pain, 179 individuals after lumbar discectomy, and 205 individuals with pancreatitis. The combined P value for increased A allele pain was 0. 0001 in the five cohorts tested (1277 people in total). The two alleles of the SNP rs 6746030 alter the coding sequence of the sodium channel Nav 1. 7. Each was separately transfected into HEK 293 cells and electrophysiologically assessed by patch-clamping. The two alleles showed {{a difference in the}} voltage-dependent slow inactivation (P = 0. 042) where the A allele would be predicted to increase Nav 1. 7 activity. Finally, we genotyped 186 healthy females characterized by their responses to a diverse set of noxious stimuli. The A allele of rs 6746030 was associated with an altered pain threshold and the effect mediated through C-fiber activation. We conclude that individuals experience differing amounts of pain, per nociceptive stimulus, {{on the basis of their}} SCN 9 A rs 6746030 genotype...|$|E
