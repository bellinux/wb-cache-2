5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one <b>host</b> <b>species</b> or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the <b>host</b> <b>species</b> decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus popilliae {{which causes}} milky spore disease {{has been found}} useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very specific to its <b>host</b> <b>species</b> and is harmless to vertebrates and other invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect <b>host</b> <b>species</b> and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the present knowledge and some new faunistic and zoogeographic data of the insufficiently researched tribe Bryobiini in Serbia. In Serbia, this group of mites is represented by eight species, including four species new to Serbian fauna: Bryobia angustisetis Jakobashvili, B. lagodechiana Reck, B. ulmophila Reck and B. vasiljevi Reck. New data on <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> and families have also been obtained - two new <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> for B. angustisetis, two <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> and two <b>host</b> plant families for B. graminum, one <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> for B. lagodechiana, four <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> and one <b>host</b> plant family for B. rubrioculus, two <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> and one <b>host</b> plant family for B. ulmophila, and one <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> for B. vasiljevi. This overview was supplemented with data on the other groups of leaf-inhabiting mites that coexist with Bryobiini species. Statistical analysis of interspecific association was done to determine the role of 15 associated predatory mite species belonging to the families Phytoseiidae, Anystidae and Trombidiidae...|$|R

25|$|The Dry Tortugas {{archipelago}} {{is classified}} as a borderline subtropicaltropical ecosystem, <b>hosting</b> <b>species</b> that do not normally breed in, and are not commonly found anywhere else within, the continental United States or the islands and waters surrounding it.|$|R
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. <b>Host</b> <b>species</b> include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their <b>host</b> <b>species</b> occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable <b>host</b> <b>species</b> and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
50|$|Female Glyptapanteles oviposit into {{caterpillar}} <b>hosts.</b> <b>Species</b> parasitized by Glyptapanteles include Lymantria dispar, {{as well as}} Chrysodeixis chalcites and Thyrinteina leucocerae (both pictured). The caterpillar {{continues to}} grow and feed normally until the 4th or 5th instar, whereupon up to 80 fully grown larvae emerge from its body to pupate.|$|R
50|$|Tibet's {{elevation}} {{and lack}} of precipitation produces an alpine tundra environment, which reduces <b>species</b> diversity. Tibet <b>hosts</b> <b>species</b> of wolf, snow leopard, wild yak, wild donkey, cranes, vultures, hawks, geese, snakes, and buffalo. One notable animal is the high-altitude jumping spider, that can live at elevations of over 6500 m.|$|R
50|$|Designed for the {{presentation}} of complex and voluminous data, the UCSC Browser is optimized for speed. By pre-aligning the 55 million RNAs of GenBank {{to each of the}} 81 genome assemblies (many of the 46 species have more than one assembly), the browser allows instant access to the alignments of any RNA to any of the <b>hosted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of <b>host</b> <b>species</b> {{in the area}} must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E

5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among the {{branches}} of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate relationship with their <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either {{lay their eggs}} on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated <b>host</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{has evolved into}} many strains, classified by the natural <b>host</b> <b>species.</b> SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) {{are thought to have}} a long evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.|$|E

5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a <b>host</b> <b>species</b> for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their <b>host</b> <b>species</b> and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
50|$|Ecosystem {{changes can}} alter species' distributions. For example, edge effects {{describe}} {{what happens when}} part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly <b>hosting</b> <b>species</b> that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.|$|R
50|$|Members of Bdellonemertea are all commensal, {{living in}} the mantle {{cavities}} of bivalves. The only non-marine and non-bivalve <b>hosted</b> <b>species,</b> Malacobdella auriculae, is doubtful. It was described in 1847 by Émile Blanchard {{on the basis of}} a single drawing of his colleague and probably wasn't even a nemertean. Malacobdella feed on small food particles that are brought into the mollusk's ctenidia.|$|R
50|$|Reclinervellus nielseni {{is one of}} the spider-ectoparasitoids {{belonging}} to the Polysphincta genus-group (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Pimplinae) and utilizes exclusively Cyclosa spiders (Araneae, Araneidae) as <b>hosts.</b> The <b>species</b> is distributed through Palearctic region (from Britain to Japan) but is rather sparse. <b>Host</b> spider <b>species</b> is different in accordance with the region, that is Cyclosa conica in Europe whereas Cyclosa argenteoalba in Japan.|$|R
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many <b>host</b> <b>species,</b> including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} <b>host</b> <b>species</b> or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and {{antigenic}} variation of influenza is also present across a diverse set of <b>host</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
50|$|Viroplasms are {{localized}} in the perinuclear area {{or in the}} cytoplasm {{of infected}} cells and are formed early in the infection cycle. The number {{and the size of}} viroplasms depend on the virus, the virus isolate, <b>hosts</b> <b>species,</b> and the stage of the infection. For example, viroplasms of mimivirus have a similar size to the nucleus of its host, the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviors}} of female Eretmocerus sp. nr. californiens raised from Bemisia argentifolii Bellows 2 ̆ 6 Perring on melon, Cucumis melo L., were analysed on four different <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> (cotton, melon, sweet potato and Abutilon theophrasti Medic). Comparison with previously published results of similarly treated females reared from sweet potato plants showed performance related differences leading to oviposition. In the present study, the generalized behavioral pathway (walking, host- encounter, antennation, probing and oviposition) did not vary among <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> for melon- reared parasitoid females. Host assessment by antennation leading to host acceptance for probing varied from 10. 5 - 12. 3 sec among the <b>host</b> plant <b>species</b> with no <b>host</b> stage- related differences in duration.
