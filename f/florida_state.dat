5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland.

Under those circumstances, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> earlier in the season.|$|E

The following week, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> defeated Maryland, 30–16, eliminating another contender. The divisional championship came down to the final week.

5|$|<b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to <b>Florida</b> <b>State.</b> The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E
5|$|<b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> has {{won three}} {{national}} championships, eighteen conference titles and six division titles along with a playoff appearance.

5|$|<b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> nine-yard line. After that, a <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tech {{began at}} its 20-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the possession, <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> {{committed}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty that gave Tech a first down at its 35-yard line. Tech was further aided by two five-yard penalties against <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> that gave the Hokies another first down, and Vick completed a short pass across midfield. On the first play in <b>Florida</b> <b>State</b> territory, Vick completed a 49-yard throw to wide receiver André Davis for Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point attempt was good, and with 30seconds remaining in the quarter, Tech narrowed Florida State's lead to 147.|$|E
