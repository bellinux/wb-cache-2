25|$|Ibrahim {{was born}} in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been {{practitioners}} of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion. His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was done with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his <b>father</b> <b>always</b> ground him for not following his ancestors's rituals and mocking their idols.|$|E

His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and {{his father was a}} Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his <b>father</b> <b>always</b> referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced [...] "Stashu". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my <b>father</b> <b>always</b> prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E

It is easier for the Chinese public to understand the relationship between father and son because “One thing about the play that is very Chinese is the way Willy tries to make his sons successful."

2500|$|Luther's <b>father</b> <b>always</b> preached in German, {{never in}} English.

His voice was one of remarkable compass and sweetness. His thoughts logical and good, his imagination fine, his gestures graceful and wonderfully expressive, and his manner all earnestness, pathos, fire; his own soul all alive with the truth he was uttering, and his auditors held spell bound and weeping under his moving exaltations of truth and his powerful appeals." [...] The elder Gotwald had a fiery temper, which his son, Luther said often caused his father great embarrassment and remorse. However, Luther went on to give this amusing account {{of the effect of}} his father's equally fiery eloquence in the pulpit, albeit in German.|$|E
2500|$|The singer began {{receiving}} {{complaints from}} employees, her fashion designer, and her cousin about Saldívar's management skills. They claimed that Saldívar mismanaged Selena's affairs, manipulated their decisions, destroyed their creations, intimidated and threatened them, and secretly recorded them without their consent or knowledge. Selena {{did not believe}} Saldívar, now a close friend, would impose on her fashion business. Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving complaints after the initial attempts to have Saldívar fired from her job failed. He tried convincing Selena that Saldívar might be a bad influence on her. She brushed aside the comments since her <b>father</b> <b>always</b> mistrusted people. In January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving letters and phone calls from angry fans who had sent their enrollment fees for the fan club and received nothing. He began an investigation and found that Saldívar had used forged checks to embezzle $30,000 from both the fan club and the boutiques. [...] On March 9, 1995, the Quintanilla family held a meeting to discuss the disappearing funds. Saldívar's answers to Quintanilla, Jr.'s questions were not convincing, and he informed {{her that if she}} could not disprove his accusations that he would get the police involved.|$|E

[...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Preparation for week {{three of}} the {{competition}} was difficult for DeLay, as the pre-stress fractures in his feet turned into full stress fractures. Because of the pain, he was shown in pre-dance footage having to stop practicing at times, including during his pre-show rehearsal {{the day of his}} dance. His doctors told him not to dance anymore anytime soon, and they and show producers advised him to withdraw from the remainder of the competition. In announcing his decision to dance anyway, DeLay laughed, [...] "What's a little pain when you can party?" [...] He jokingly added, [...] "I'm insane or stupid—one. I don't know which," [...] but also cited how his <b>father</b> <b>always</b> used to tell him never to quit. And so, outfitted in red pants with a red and white candy-cane striped shirt (red is the unofficial color of the Republican Party), which had emblazoned on its back a large, sequined version of the GOP's elephant symbol, DeLay and his partner Burke, who wore a blue (the unofficial color of the Democratic Party) dress with white stars and a sequined version of the Dems' donkey symbol, danced the samba (video available [...] ) to the bouncy, 1975 song by the band War, [...] "Why Can't We Be Friends?" [...] All three judges (Inaba, Goodman, and Tonioli) praised DeLay tremendously for his effort, but said his injuries unfortunately compromised his performance. They awarded him a combined 15 out of 30 possible points. Once again, however, such a score placed the former congressman low on the leader board, in second-to-last place. On October 6, 2009, DeLay announced he would be leaving competition on the show following the recommendation of his doctors and after consultation with his family. However, he made a special appearance on the season finale to dance the [...] "Texas Two-Step".|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{entered the}} 1993 season anticipating {{that he would}} be better after his past two surgeries, and he had also {{incorporated}} Williams' advice into his swing. The Padres lost 101 games that year for the team's worst record during his career. They finished last in the division, behind even the Colorado Rockies, who were an expansion team in their inaugural season. San Diego that season had traded most of its star players—including Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, and Tony Fernández—in fire sales. Gwynn finished with a [...]358 average, the then-second best average of his career, but Colorado's Andrés Galarraga won the title at [...]370. He batted [...]587 on pulled balls, compared to his [...]315 in 1991 before Williams' pointers. Gwynn was affected early in the season by a sprained thumb, but he hit [...]400 (76-for-190) over {{the second half of the}} season. On June 10, he missed the opportunity to hit for the cycle when Manager Jim Riggleman replaced him in the seventh inning of a 14–2 rout against the Dodgers after he had hit for a home run, double, and triple in his three prior at-bats. Riggleman was not aware that he needed a single to complete the cycle. Still wary of Clark's earlier criticism that he was selfish, Gwynn did not contest his removal, which angered his manager when he found out after the game. On August 4 against the Giants, Gwynn had the only six-hit game of his career. He might have gone 7–for–7 if not for an excellent play at first base by Will Clark. Gwynn recorded his 2,000th hit with a single off Colorado lefthander Bruce Ruffin on August 6. His last game was September 5 before undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clear [...] "loose bodies" [...] from his knee. It was the fourth consecutive year his season ended early, and the third straight season it was due to left knee surgery. After the season, Gwynn's father, Charles, died young at the age of 57 from heart problems. Two days earlier, Charles had argued with Gwynn that he should leave San Diego, questioning the Padres' commitment to winning. Gwynn eventually concluded, [...] "No, I like it here, I should stay." [...] He contemplated leaving baseball after his father's death; however, he recalled his <b>father</b> <b>always</b> telling him to [...] "never be a quitter, work hard".|$|E
