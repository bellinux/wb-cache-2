40|$|Branding has {{traditionally}} been viewed as an essential tool for marketers to establish an identity for their products. Even products among the commodity range make use of branding to establish a position for themselves in the market. Unbranded or “generic” products, therefore, tend to go against this branding principle. These products, which are usually sold at a price which is lower than their branded equivalents, are most often found {{in the area of}} low-involvement grocery items. Previous studies of consumer perceptions of <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> tend to be broad in their scope by looking at <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> as a product category, rather than seeking consumer views on individual <b>generic</b> <b>products.</b> This paper identifies the characteristics of generic purchasers, and their broad perceptions of <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> as a group; and, the research extends previous work in the area by comparing a range of individual <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> to each other in terms of their value, quality and packaging. In addition, the research identifies how much importance consumers attach to value, quality and packaging when buying these individual <b>products</b> - in <b>generic</b> form or otherwise. A mail survey of 1, 000 New Zealanders revealed that, in contrast to previous studies, generic consumers tend to be older and on a lower household income. In general, consumers do not believe that generics are substandard products. However, when looking at individual <b>generic</b> <b>products,</b> the less standardized <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> are not performing as well as others when it comes to consumers’ perceptions and demands. Proposes that if <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> are to have a recognizable future, {{it may be necessary to}} embark on a program which enhances consumer perception of the quality and value of the less standardized <b>generic</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{petroleum}} discovery at the Drake Well {{in western}} Pennsylvania in 1859 caused {{a great deal}} of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in Canada, where petroleum had been discovered at Oil Springs, Ontario in 1858, and southern Poland, where Ignacy Łukasiewicz had been distilling lamp oil from petroleum seeps since 1852. The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side-step the oil-from-coal patents of both Young and Gesner, and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone. As a result, the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the 1860s. The petroleum-based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene, and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status, and became the lower-case <b>generic</b> <b>product</b> “kerosene”. Because Gesner’s original Kerosene had been also known as “coal oil,” generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called “coal oil” {{in some parts of the}} United States well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Concerns have {{recently}} emerged about the efficacy {{and the quality}} of antibacterial <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> approved for use in humans. METHODS: We searched Medline and Embase for original research articles on antibacterial <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> published in English or French before July 2013. RESULTS: We selected 37 original research articles: 15 on β-lactams, 10 on glycopeptides, and 12 on other antibacterial agents. The majority of articles (73. 0 %) were published during 2008 - 2012. Study designs included analytical chemistry (n = 9), in vitro susceptibility studies (n = 14), animal experiments (n = 6, including 5 using the neutropenic mouse thigh infection model), and clinical studies in humans (n = 15). Of the 37 studies, 14 (37. 8 %) suggested that some <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> may be inferior to the innovator in terms of purity (n = 2), in vitro activity (n = 3), in vivo efficacy in experimental models (n = 4), clinical efficacy (n = 2), taste (n = 2), or compliance and acceptability in children (n = 1). The majority of in vitro studies (78. 6 %) found no significant difference between <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> and the innovator. Most (5 / 6) in vivo studies suggesting a difference between <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> and the innovator were performed in an animal model that is not validated for the evaluation of the efficacy of antibacterial agents. The level of evidence was constantly low in clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: Published data on antibacterial <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> are limited and heterogeneous, thus precluding any attempt to generalize the study results. This systematic review suggests that additional evidence would be needed before considering a revision of the marketing authorization process for antibacterial <b>generic</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

The results from our investigation will provide researchers and practitioners with a deep insight to the EP and also to guide them in making decision regarding the use of EP. The main findings from our investigation are as follows: • EP is not used standalone as a software process model. Rather it is used as a concept that can be augmented with some iterative software process model. • Negative and positive aspects of EP were highlighted by discussing situations where it could be a better choice, with its advantages and disadvantages. • An initial validation was performed on EP for customizable <b>generic</b> <b>products.</b> Reported results from this case study show that the selected approach is a good choice when you want to have innovative product, clear ambiguous and sketchy requirements, discover new requirements, save resources of software testing, involve and satisfy customer.

30|$|There {{were three}} major reasons that {{prevented}} an increasing usage of generic drugs in Japan. (a) Several surveys indicated {{that one of}} the major reasons for not choosing <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> was concerns over product quality (Fujimura and Watanabe 2012). Moreover, some reports on substandard generic drugs in other countries also raised anxiety (Vial et al. 2008). (b) Relatively small economic incentive to use generic drugs under universal health insurance systems were considered another reason for their discrete use (Takizawa et al. 2015). Indeed, both the National Health Insurance and the Employees’ Health Insurance systems set relatively high official drug prices for generic ethical pharmaceuticals (60 – 70  % until 2013, currently 50 – 60  % of the corresponding brand product), and low copayment ratio (usually below 30  % for many insured clients), which reduces difference in each patient’s payment and their choice of <b>generic</b> <b>products.</b> (c) The general patient’s preference for branded products and the absence of formulation substitution rights for pharmacists resulted in a barrier that prevents usage of <b>generic</b> drug <b>products.</b> The aging society and the relatively high official price for <b>generic</b> <b>products</b> promoted the development of many “easy-to-swallow” oral formulations implementations, such as changes from capsules to tablets, and tablets downsizing.|$|R
