When I {{first had}} the {{happiness}} of looking upon you, it was one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of five is guaranteed at the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> not exceeding twelve months from the present date. My mother has a little property, which {{takes the form of}} a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is all for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who has not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at which time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt liquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is lowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the 'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore you. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a declaration--to make an offer!" ...|$|E

50|$|In {{property}} {{law of the}} United Kingdom and the United States and other common law countries, a remainder is a future interest given to a person (who {{is referred to as}} the transferee or remainderman) that is capable of becoming possessory upon the natural end of a prior estate created by the same instrument. Thus, the prior estate must be one that is capable of ending naturally, for example upon the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> of years or the death of a life tenant. A future interest following a fee simple absolute cannot be a remainder because of the preceding infinite duration.|$|E
50|$|A {{resignation}} is {{the formal}} act {{of giving up}} or quitting one's office or position. A resignation can occur when a person holding a position gained by election or appointment steps down, but leaving a position upon the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> is not considered resignation. When an employee chooses to leave a position, it is considered a resignation, as opposed to involuntary termination, which occurs when the employee involuntarily loses a job. Whether an employee resigned or was terminated is sometimes a topic of dispute, because in many situations, a terminated employee is eligible for severance pay and/or unemployment benefits, whereas one who voluntarily resigns may not be eligible. Abdication {{is the equivalent of}} resignation of a reigning monarch or pope, or other holder of a non-political, hereditary or similar position.|$|E

50|$|The {{school was}} based on the family plan where boys lived in cottages with a matron, who acted as mother, and a guard, who acted as father. The guards were {{actually}} skilled tradesmen who also supervised the boys at work. Some of the trades taught to the boys included carpentry, tailoring, printing, mechanics, and husbandry. The boys also performed work in the kitchen, laundry, and assisted the matrons with the housekeeping. The following is an excerpt from Superintendent Hendries first annual report:It seemed a curious undertaking to erect a school for these waifs without bar or cell or hardly a whip, but the lads appear to have dropped into the groove at once, there having been but three attempts to escape. This school differs from a reformatory in that it is in no sense a prison, and the boys are not sent down as criminals, neither are they turned loose upon the world at the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed <b>term,</b> but are apprenticed to some trusty farmer or mechanic...
