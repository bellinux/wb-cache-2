5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and <b>imine</b> formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or <b>imine</b> group. A negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E
25|$|N-Alkyl <b>imines</b> are {{generally}} more difficult to reduce with high enantioselectivity than N-aryl <b>imines.</b> Most catalyst systems that reduce N-alkyl <b>imines</b> enantioselectively are based on rhodium(I) or ruthenium(II).|$|R

5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone <b>imine</b> (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, <b>imine,</b> or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated <b>imine,</b> a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|The p-toluene-sulfinyl <b>imines</b> {{are useful}} for the highly {{diastereoselective}} asymmetric synthesis of α-amino acids, β-amino acids, syn- and anti-2,3-diamino esters, α-amino aldehydes and ketones, β-amino ketones, α-amino phosphonates, aziridine 2-carboxylates, and aziridine 2-phosphnates. Many of these same transformations can been carried out with tert-butylsulfinyl <b>imines.</b> For the asymmetric synthesis of amines tert-butane-sulfinyl <b>imines</b> are required because lithium and Grignard reagents react at the sulfinyl sulfur in p-toluene-sulfinyl <b>imines.</b> [...] Mild acid treatment readily removes the N-sulfinyl group in the sulfinamide products affording the free amine derivatives. An advantage of tert-butytsulfinyl <b>imines</b> is that acid treatment of the corresponding sulfinamides leads to easily removal by-products.|$|R
40|$|Nucleophilic {{addition}} to carbon–nitrogen double bonds (<b>imines)</b> {{represents one of}} the most common strategies for the synthesis of amine derivatives. In order to circumvent the problem associated with low reactivity of <b>imines</b> in nucleophilic addition, various <b>imines</b> with electron-withdrawing groups at nitrogen have been studied, and many of them were successfully applied in asymmetric methodologies. Especially N-carbamoyl <b>imines</b> were found to be useful in the enantioselective synthesis of various organic compounds, due to their increased reactivity toward nucleophiles as well as limited difficulties connected with the removal of the carbamoyl moiety in target molecules. The aim of this review is to cover enantioselective methods based on N-carbamoyl <b>imines,</b> focusing on synthetically useful protocols. <br/...|$|R

25|$|Because the substituents {{attached}} to the <b>imine</b> nitrogen exert a profound influence on reactivity, few general catalyst systems exist for the enantioselective hydrogenation of imines and <b>imine</b> derivatives. However, catalyst systems have been developed that catalyze hydrogenation of particular classes of imines with high enantioselectivity and yield. This section describes some of these systems and is organized by the substitution pattern of the <b>imine.</b>|$|E

25|$|Note {{that water}} is {{required}} for normal peptide bond cleavage of the iminolactone intermediate. In formic acid, cleavage of Met-Ser and Met-Thr bonds is enhanced with increased water concentration because these conditions favor the addition of water across the <b>imine</b> rather than reaction of the side chain hydroxyl with the <b>imine.</b> Lowered pH tends to increase cleavage rates by inhibiting methionine side chain oxidation.|$|E
40|$|The {{structures}} and reactivities of nitrile <b>imines</b> are subjects of continuing debate. Several nitrile <b>imines</b> were generated photochemically or thermally and investigated by IR spectroscopy in Ar matrices at cryogenic temperatures (Ph-CNN-H 6, Ph-CNN-CH 3 17, Ph-CNN-SiMe 3 23, Ph-CNN-Ph 29, Ph 3 C-CNN-CPh 3 34, and the boryl-CNN-boryl derivative 39). The effect of substituents on the {{structures and}} IR absorptions of nitrile <b>imines</b> was investigated computationally at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* level. IR spectra were analyzed {{in terms of}} calculated anharmonic vibrational spectra and were generally in very good agreement with the calculated spectra. Infrared spectra were found to reflect the structures of nitrile <b>imines</b> accurately. Nitrile <b>imines</b> with IR absorptions above 2200 cm(- 1) have essentially propargylic structures, possessing a CN triple bond (typically PhCNNSiMe 3 23, PhCNNPh 29, and boryl-CNN-boryl 39). Nitrile <b>imines</b> with IR absorptions below ca. 2200 cm(- 1) {{are more likely to}} be allenic (e. g., HCNNH 1, PhCNNH 6, HCNNPh 43, PhCNNCH 3 17, and Ph 3 C-CNN-CPh 3 34). All nitrile <b>imines</b> isomerize to the corresponding carbodiimides both thermally and photochemically. Monosubstituted carbodiimides isomerize thermally to the corresponding cyanamides (e. g., Ph-N=C=N-H 5 [...] > Ph-NH-CN 8), which are therefore the thermal end products for nitrile <b>imines</b> of the types RCNNH and HCNNR. This tautomerization is reversible under flash vacuum thermolysis conditions...|$|R
50|$|N-Sulfinyl <b>imines</b> (N-sulfinylimines, sulfinimines, thiooxime S-oxides) are a {{class of}} <b>imines</b> bearing a sulfinyl group {{attached}} to nitrogen. These <b>imines</b> display usefully stereoselectivity reactivity and due {{to the presence of}} the chiral electron withdrawing N-sulfinyl group. They allow 1,2-addition of organometallic reagents to <b>imines.</b> The N-sulfinyl group exerts powerful and predictable stereodirecting effects resulting in high levels of asymmetric induction. Racemization of the newly created carbon-nitrogen stereo center is prevented because anions are stabilized at nitrogen (i.e., the sulfinyl group is a versatile amine protection group). The sulfinyl chiral auxiliary is readily removed by simple acid hydrolysis. The addition of organometallic reagents to N-sulfinyl <b>imines</b> is the most reliable and versatile method for the asymmetric synthesis of amine derivatives. These building blocks have been employed in the asymmetric synthesis of numerous biologically active compounds.|$|R

25|$|A decarboxylase with {{cofactor}} {{pyridoxal phosphate}} (PLP) removes CO2 from 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine. PLP forms an <b>imine</b> with the amino acid derivative. The amine on the pyridine is protonated and {{acts as an}} electron sink, enabling {{the breaking of the}} C-C bond and releasing CO2. Protonation of the amine from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring and then <b>imine</b> is hydrolyzed to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP.|$|E
25|$|When {{methionine}} {{is followed}} by serine or threonine, side reactions can occur that destroy the methionine without peptide bond cleavage. Normally, once the iminolactone is formed (refer to figure), water and acid can react with the <b>imine</b> to cleave the peptide bond, forming a homoserine lactone and new C-terminal peptide. However, if the adjacent amino acid to methionine has a hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group, this group can react with the <b>imine</b> to form a homoserine without peptide bond cleavage. These two cases are shown in the figure.|$|E

The thermochromic properties were studied for the single crystal and polycrystalline samples of the <b>imines.</b> The supramolecular impact on the keto-enol tautomerism in the solid state was studied using SCXRD and NMR, while NMR spectroscopy was used for the solution state. All four <b>imines</b> are thermochromic, although the color changes of the single crystals are not as strong as of the polycrystalline samples.

25|$|A notable {{example of}} the anion-binding {{mechanism}} is the hydrocyanation of imines catalyzed by Jacobsen’s amido-thiourea catalyst depicted in the below diagram. This reaction {{is also one of}} the most extensively studied through computational, spectroscopic, labeling and kinetic experiments. While direct addition of cyanide to a catalyst-bound <b>imine</b> was considered, an alternative mechanism involving formation of an iminium-cyanide ion pair controlled by catalyst was calculated to have a barrier that is lower by 20 kcal/mol. The proposed most likely mechanism begins with binding of the catalyst to HNC, which exists in equilibrium with HCN. This complex then protonates a molecule of <b>imine,</b> forming an iminium-cyanide ion pair with the catalyst binding and stabilizing the cyanide anion. The iminium is thought to also interact with the amide carbonyl on the catalyst molecule (see bifunctional catalysis below). The bound cyanide anion then rotates, and attacks the iminium through carbon. The investigators conclude that though imine-urea binding was observed through spectroscopy and was supported by early kinetic experiments, <b>imine</b> binding is off-cycle and all evidence points toward this mechanism involving thiourea-bound cyanide.|$|E

Although a variety of general methods have been developed for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones, methods for the hydrogenation of carbon–nitrogen double bonds are less general. Hydrogenation of imines is complicated by both syn/anti isomerization and tautomerization to enamines, which may be hydrogenated with low enantioselectivity {{in the presence of a}} chiral catalyst. Additionally, the substituent attached to nitrogen affects both the reactivity and spatial properties of the <b>imine,</b> complicating the development of a general catalyst system for <b>imine</b> hydrogenation.
