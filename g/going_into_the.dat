5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
