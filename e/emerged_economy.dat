40|$|We analyze {{patterns}} and determinants of technology alliance formation with partner firms from <b>emerging</b> <b>economies,</b> {{with a focus}} on European firms' alliance strategies. We examine to what extent European firms' alliance formation with partners based in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> is persistent, that is: to what extent prior collaborative experience determines new alliance formation, and we compare this pattern with alliance formation with developed country partners. Second, we examine to what extent prior engagement in international alliances with partners from developed countries increases the propensity to form technology alliances with partners based in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> and vice versa (interrelation). We find that both persistence and interrelation effects are present, and that they are generally not weaker for <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> alliances. Alliance formation with Indian and Chinese firms is significantly more likely if firms have prior alliance experience with Japanese firms. The findings suggest that firms extend their alliance portfolio from developed to <b>emerging</b> <b>economies,</b> increasing the geographic diversity of their alliance portfolio and building on their prior international alliances experience.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{there has been a}} {{substantial}} shift in the global innovation landscape. Multinationals from developed economies are increasingly globalizing their R&D activities and are developing an "open innovation" model to source innovations from outside the firm, including from <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> such as those in Asia. In addition, <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> firms, which traditionally have played a secondary role in the global innovation landscape, have now begun to catch up in developing their own innovative capabilities. This study explores the implications of this new innovation landscape for CEOs of multinationals and <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> firms, as well as for international management scholars and educators. While the multinationals might appropriate rents from their existing capabilities and source new ones in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies,</b> they may be threatened by weak intellectual property rights regimes and unintended knowledge spillovers to local firms, creating potential competitors. Firms in the <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> can learn from and catch up with investing multinationals, but to do so they need to develop their own innovative capabilities and move from a process to a product focus and from imitation to innovation.

40|$|During {{the crises}} of the 1990 s, <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> usually lacked the policy tools {{to deal with}} {{external}} shocks that were available to advanced economies.

Design/methodology/approach - The findings reported in the paper are based on desk research and review of the papers contained in the volume. Findings - The paper finds that the adoption of appropriate corporate governance systems is becoming a central issue in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> Factors such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the adoption of international donor led reforms, and the globalisation of capital markets are among the factors that are driving corporate governance reforms in less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> Research limitations/implications - The pressure from international donors has compelled some less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> to adopt corporate governance models developed in the West with no modification. The paper argues that while it is imperative for less developed and <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> to reform their corporate governance systems, {{it is important that}} these systems are adapted to suite the specific needs of individual countries.

30|$|Moreover, {{there exists}} a {{significant}} level of heterogeneity among <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> themselves and as such no two <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> are alike (Hosskisson et al., 2000).

Thus, the depth of investing experience in one <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> does not automatically spill-over to any other. Guillen (2000) argues that specialized skills possessed by incumbents make them adept in negotiating the governmental bottlenecks in the <b>emerging</b> <b>economy,</b> which is what the foreign MNCs often lack.

40|$|The aim of  {{the paper}} is to advance the {{development}} of theory inthe field of international business by seeking to understand {{to what extent the}} resource-based view  (RBV),  built  on  the  experience  and  evidence  from advanced  economies,  helps understand the internationalisation process of <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> SMEs. The  paper  is  built  on  a systematic  literature  review of peer-reviewed  journal  articles  on  SME  internationalisation  motives  and  enablers  in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> The  RBV  arguments  explain  the  internationalisation  process  of emerging economy  SMEs  only  to  some  extent.   In  contrast  to advanced economy  firms,  the internationalisation of SMEs from <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> {{is more likely to be}} driven by the  exploitation  of  cost advantage,  and  motivation  to  gain  new  knowledge  that  is unavailable domestically and enhance their domestic  market reputation. Besides it is more handicapped by a lack of internationalisation experience or international ties. To  understand the process of <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> SME  internationalisation,  it  is  necessary  to  study  to  what extent  other  logics contribute to its explication. Further research should also seek to synthesise findings of the above major theoretical frameworks in the contextof <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> SME internationalisation process. The  originality  of  this  work  lies  in  studying the internationalisation motives and enablers of indigenousSMEs in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> and challenging the applicability of the RBV arguments in this specific context...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore to what extentthe patterns of the internationalisation  process  described  in  the  new  venture  (NV) internationalisation theory, developed on the experience and practice of advanced economy firms, apply to the <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> context. The  paper  is  a  systematic  literature  review  developed on the basis of peer reviewed journal articles on NV internationalisation in <b>emerging</b> <b>economies.</b> It critically evaluates the applicability  of arguments proposed by the NV internationalisation theory to the <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> context. The  paper  contributes  to  the  NV  internationalisation theory  by offering  some propositions  on  the  specifics  of  international entrepreneurship in the <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> context. Findings:  In  contrast  to  firms  from  advanced  economies, internationalisation  of  NV from <b>emerging</b> <b>economies</b> is mainly driven by push factors related to their domestic markets.   Transportation, communication  and  digital  technology  play  a  less  relevant role in emerging economies; besides, their significance is more context specific; while their absence does not inhibit rapid internationalisation. To  better  understand  the  process  of  NV internationalisation in the <b>emerging</b> <b>economy</b> context,it is necessary to study to what extent  other  theoretical  logics  contribute  to  its  explication.   Further  research  should also seek to synthesise findings of research on other major theoretical frameworks...|$|R
