Methods: Through a collaborative {{partnership with the}} Tungasuvvingat Inuit Family Resource Centre, a series of key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted to gather information on specific sources of health information, strategies of health <b>information</b> <b>dissemination,</b> <b>and</b> overall themes in health information processes. Findings: Distinct patterns of health <b>information</b> sources <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> strategies emerged from the data. Major themes included: the importance of visual learning, community Elders, and cultural interpreters; community cohesion; and the Inuit and non-Inuit distinction. The core sources of health information are family members and sources from within the Inuit community. The principal dissemination strategy for health information was direct communication, either through one-on-one interactions or in groups. Conclusion: This community-specific perspective of health information sources an...|$|R

The project focused not only on information obtain-able through libraries for research, teaching, learning and practice, but also on ICT applications concerned with the administration and planning of health services in Uganda. A thematic analysis highlighted {{the current state of}} ICT applications, the extent of applications, the roles played and problems faced. The paper further explores areas where it is used most, cost of accessing information, user profile, ICT literacy, quality of services and telemedicine in the country. It concludes that a number of challenges must be addressed if the full benefit of the use and application of ICT in health <b>information</b> access <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> is to be realized in Uganda, and draws the attention of all the stakeholders in the health sector to the need to support and promote ICT as the most effective tool for health <b>information</b> access <b>and</b> <b>dissemination...</b>|$|R

Considering that every {{individual}} has {{a different set of}} convictions and larger groups act once a consensus decision is reached, one can see that debate is an inherent exercise in decision-making. This requires a sustainably generated surplus to allow time for intellectual exchange, gathering of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of findings. It is essential that the full spectrum of options remain treated equally. At the end of this process, a choice has to be made. Looking back at a later time point, a retrospective analysis sometimes reveals that the choice was neither completely free nor a truly conscious one. Leaving the issue of consequences of a once made decision aside, we wish to contribute to the debate of the problem of choice. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper takes a socio-technical {{perspective}} {{to analyze the}} ongoing practices of making an eHealth infrastructure, namely a web-based communication platform, which aims to improve healthcare delivery in Norway. The platform is planned to support interaction between patients and healthcare providers, patient access to personal health <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of health knowledge to the public. The analysis {{is based on the}} 'scales of infrastructure' concept found in Information Systems research, which shows the complexity of the design, development and implementation process across three scales of activities for achieving durability: institutionalization, organizing work, and technology enactment. The case analysis brings the non-linearity of the ongoing practices to the foreground, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between technology design and infrastructural work. © 2011 European Federation for Medical Informatics.

This is true for indigenous people across northern Australia, although to date there has been very limited commercial use of wildlife within indigenous Australian communities. In this study, we examine factors affecting the establishment of enterprises utilising animal species in remote indigenous communities and suggest ways of improving uptake. We found four major areas affecting the progress of these enterprises: a lack of comprehensive market <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> of that knowledge; a lack of basic infrastructure and training; {{a need for more}} appropriate and flexible government policy and regulation; and adverse public perceptions. Commercialisation of native species is at a relatively early stage compared to tropical Asia, Africa and South America, and development of these enterprises has the potential to benefit indigenous livelihoods in remote and marginal areas in Australia...|$|E
