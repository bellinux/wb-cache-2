40|$|A recent Norwegian {{legislative}} proposal, {{likely to}} become law in 2014, suggests that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> {{should be able to}} approach non-professional, private investors. In light of this, the objective of our thesis is to examine if <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are an attractive investment opportunity for a Norwegian private investor. By defining two sub-questions, we use empirical research and relevant academic literature to study several aspects of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Based on the Sharpe ratio and the Modified Sharpe ratio, we find support for <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> providing an attractive risk/reward relationship. However, these performance evaluations are insufficient due to the illiquidity of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds,</b> the leverage risks, and the returns biases. As the efficient frontiers of stocks and bonds improve when <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are included, one can argue that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> provide unique returns. However, the non-normality, skewness, and kurtosis may distort the efficient frontiers. In addition, the calculated correlations between <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and traditional assets, as well as the similarities between the payoff structure of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and short put options, indicate that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are not providing unique exposure. In total, our recommendation for Norwegian private investors is to be cautious with regards to investing in <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that the performance of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> may be distorted, the risk management features may be lower than expected, and <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> will likely be an expensive way of obtaining an unattractive payoff structure. nhhma...|$|R
