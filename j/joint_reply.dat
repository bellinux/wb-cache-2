40|$|Introduction & Aims: Compression gloves are {{provided}} to reduce hand pain and stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hand osteoarthritis (OA). We surveyed North West Region Rheumatology occupational therapists (NWRROTs) to investigate practice, wearing regimens, assessment methods and costs. Methods: Survey content was discussed, developed, reviewed and modified {{with help from}} NWRROTs. The survey was e-mailed to 35 NWRROTs. Results were analysed using SPSSv 20 and content analysis Results: 22 / 35 OTs responded; 3 did not provide compression gloves and three <b>joint</b> <b>replies</b> (ie 17 questionnaires). OTs had average experience of: 14 years in Rheumatology; and 3 - 4 years providing gloves. OTs provided gloves to: 16 - 17 people with IA/RA or hand OA/month, i. e. 30...|$|R

30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} consists in showing that the theory of games with general complementarities developed by Calciano [11] can be shown to hold {{in the context of}} CPOs as well. In particular, the paper analyzes the existence and the order structure of Nash equilibria for extended (semi-) uniform g-modular games in which the strategy space is a CPO, and the <b>joint</b> best <b>reply</b> correspondence satisfies monotonicity requirements weaker than that of Veinott.|$|R
3000|$|Games with {{strategic}} complementarities {{in which}} the <b>joint</b> best <b>reply</b> correspondence is Veinott increasing (Veinott [5], Calciano [6]) rely on Zhou’s [7] extension of Tarski fixed point theorem (Tarski [8]) to set-valued maps. Earlier attempts that aim to generalize games with strategic complementarities have mainly concentrated on the increasingness notions (see Antoniadou [9], Calciano [6]). In particular, recently, using the notions of upper and lower increasingness (Smithson [10]) which are substantially weaker than Veinott increasingness, Calciano [11] has presented games with general complementarities and g-modular games that retain the main properties of supermodular games. On the other hand, among those very few attempts to extend the set of strategy sets, d’Orey [12] has employed quasilattices while requiring even a stronger notion of increasingness than that of Veinott [5]. A notion of quasilattices has also been introduced by Calciano [11], and this notion {{has been linked to}} that of lattices by means of specific theorems, contrary to the notion of d’Orey [12]. Specifically, Calciano [11] has provided the conditions under which quasilattices and sublattices coincide after showing that the set of maximizers of a g-modular function on a lattice is a quasilattice.a [...]...|$|R
3000|$|Before {{and shortly}} after the {{foundation}} of the joint venture, two “Export Incentive Certificates” (EIC) were issued by the Turkish state to R. These EICs granted the holder benefits that related to the activities of the joint venture and therefore counted towards its surplus. Six years after the establishment of the joint venture R sought payment of a share of the surplus concerning the EICs’ benefits. Due to the ownership structure, no decision regarding the sharing was reached in the board of the joint venture. As a result, R issued a [...] "leadership decision" 6 that granted itself the entire share of the surplus that was generated by the EICs’ benefits. Hereupon, C called for arbitration, claiming that it was agreed in the joint venture agreement that the benefits of the EICs were to be enjoyed by the <b>joint</b> venture. R <b>replied</b> that Turkish law prohibits benefits derived from EICs to be shared with foreign entities.|$|R
40|$|The {{appeal of}} the {{conviction}} of Robert Mardian in the Watergate conspiracy trial before Judge John Sirica is the topic of this intriguing book. Written {{by a member of}} the defense team that prepared Mardian 2 ̆ 7 s appeal, Watergate Victory provides a unique defense perspective on the Watergate case while also discussing legal issues that were central to the Watergate case but which have largely been ignored. Issues that are analyzed include the admissibility of the White House tapes at the trial, the ethical obligation of the attorneys for the Committee to Re-elect the President to keep confidential what they had learned from Gordon Liddy, and issues involving multiple conspiracies, variance and severance.
