These uncertain parameters are updated by an adaptation law that is derived by Lyapunov stability theorem. A robust adaptive control law by using the boundary layer is designed for the purpose of compensating for the neglected dynamic effects of the mobile platform and the six moving links that are modeled as a disturbance term.

Such methods typically cannot incorporate mechanistic information, which is commonly {{expressed in terms of}} differential equations.

A Gibbs sampler is proposed to sample from the posterior distribution and applied to a study of rats exposed to non-injurious muscle activation protocols.

40|$|The project {{continues}} to advance approximately per the revised (14 -month) schedule. Tasks 1 - 3 (Modeling, Specification and Design) are all essentially complete. Work has begun on designing {{the test equipment}} for the Test and Evaluation (Tasks 4 & 5.) One of the intents of this project is to not only dampen vibration above the damper, but to also dampen vibrations below the damper. This is accomplished by smoothing out the discontinuities as the bit drills ahead. The model has the capability to simulate the drilling looking at the depth of cut along the discontinuities. It can also look {{at the amount of}} time that the bit is in contact with the formation. It is found that under some conditions the vibrations increased the discontinuities due to resonant conditions. In the ideal situation, the damper reduces the discontinuities and smooths out the drilling. APS looked at a wide range of spring stiffness and damping properties to determine the optimum <b>damper.</b> <b>Spring</b> rates of 10, 000 lb/in to 60, 000 lbs/in were analyzed. The best compromise is at 30, 000 lb/in for the 6 3 / 4 inch tool. Low spring rates would require large displacements for the damper, while stiff springs do not provide enough motion for the damper. Several damping concepts were analyzed: (1) The first thought was to have a damper providing high damping in the upward direction and low damping in the downward direction. It was found that this increased the vibration by wallowing out the troughs of the discontinuities leading to increased displacements at the bit. (2) Another method investigated was having increased damping at high acceleration levels and less damping at lower acceleration levels. This gave improved results. (3) Constant damping so far provides the damping situation. With the proper damping level the damper can smooth out the discontinuities and provide smooth drilling. However, the damping values are different for different drilling conditions. Different WOB and ROP require different damping coefficients and therefore must be constantly adjusted to provide optimum drilling conditions. The DVMCS system is designed to provide this adjustment (4) Other methods are still being investigated. One method is a constant force damper that might provide optimum damping over a wider range...|$|E

40|$|Since future {{astrophysics}} missions require space telescopes with apertures of {{at least}} 10 meters, {{there is a need}} for on-orbit assembly methods that decouple the size of the primary mirror from the choice of launch vehicle. One option is to connect the segments edgewise using mechanisms analogous to <b>damped</b> <b>springs.</b> To evaluate the feasibility of this approach, a parametric ANSYS model that calculates the mode shapes, natural frequencies, and disturbance response of such a mirror, as well as of the equivalent monolithic mirror, has been developed. This model constructs a mirror using rings of hexagonal segments that are either connected continuously along the edges (to form a monolith) or at discrete locations corresponding to the mechanism locations (to form a segmented mirror). As an example, this paper presents the case of a mirror whose segments are connected edgewise by mechanisms analogous to a set of four collocated single-degree-of-freedom <b>damped</b> <b>springs.</b> The results of a set of parameter studies suggest that such mechanisms can be used to create a 15 -m segmented mirror that behaves similarly to a monolith, although fully predicting the segmented mirror performance would require incorporating measured mechanism properties into the model.
