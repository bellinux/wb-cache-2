50|$|In Alaska, snowshoe hares consume new {{leaves of}} {{blueberries}} (Vaccinium spp.), new shoots of <b>field</b> <b>horsetails</b> (Equisetum arvense), and fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) in spring.Grasses {{are not a}} major item due to low availability associated with sites that have adequate cover. In summer, leaves of willows, black spruce, birches, and bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum) are also consumed. Black spruce is the most heavily used and the most common species in the area. Pen trials suggest black spruce is not actually preferred. Roses (Rosa spp.) were preferred, but a minor dietary item, as they were not common in the study area. In northwest Oregon, summer foods include grasses, clovers (Trifolium spp.), other forbs, and some woody plants, including Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, and young leaves and twigs of salal. In Minnesota, aspens, willows, grasses, birches, alders, sumacs, and strawberries are consumed when green. In Ontario, summer diets consist of clovers, grasses, and forbs.|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{countryside}} at {{the beginning}} of the nineteenth century was still so varied and rich that there was room for both human beings and animals almost everywhere. It is true that for thousands of years man had struggled with the advancing forests. First the primaeval deciduous forest was cleared during the warm period following the last glaciation, and after the great climatic change at the close of the Swedish Bronze Age (ca 700 B. C.) the struggle was against the encroaching spruce on practically all fronts. The struggle resulted in culture steppes, pine heaths, birch groves and wooded meadows. All these types of landscape were gradually filled with the fauna adapted to them. Different types of cultivation have alternated, and as the nature has changed, the fauna has adapted itself. But up to the nineteenth century these changes were not so great that they altered the general picture of the animal world. Imagine Sweden a century and a half ago! Spruce forests dominated then as now, but they were less uniform; they had kept their individuality and character. Wooded meadows were numerous, for the regular leaf harvest that created them was of great importance in the former agrarian economy. In that way the spruce was kept at bay and the wooded meadows could develop freely, and there the farmers could collect leaves for winter fodder. The young Swedish soil was then still virgin. Thousands of lakes, marshes and fens, the inheritage of the great ice-cap, filled the countryside. Through the country ran the glittering silver bands of streams and brooks. In spring they widened and at times the water flooded the meadows. As summer approached, the low-lying alluvial <b>fields</b> of sedge, <b>horsetail</b> and rush were transformed by the sun into natural meadows, which were mown yearly to make use of everything that could serve as fodder for the livestock during the coming winter...|$|R
50|$|The spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like {{structures}} at {{the tips}} {{of some of the}} stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. <b>field</b> <b>horsetail,</b> E. arvense) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring. In some other species (e.g. marsh horsetail, E. palustre) they are very similar to sterile shoots, photosynthetic and with whorls of branches.|$|E
50|$|Equisetum arvense, the <b>field</b> <b>{{horsetail}}</b> or {{common horsetail}} is a herbaceous perennial plant, native throughout the arctic and temperate {{regions of the}} northern hemisphere. It has separate sterile non-reproductive and fertile spore-bearing stems, growing from a perennial underground rhizomatous stem system. The fertile stems are produced in early spring and are non-photosynthetic, while the green sterile stems start to grow after the fertile stems have wilted, and persist through the summer until the first autumn frosts. It is commonly confused with mare's tail, Hippuris vulgaris.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species in}} this genus prefer wet sandy soils, {{while others are}} adapted to wet clay soils. One species, Equisetum fluviatile, is an {{emergent}} aquatic, rooted in water with shoots growing into the air. The stalks arise from rhizomes that are deep underground and difficult to dig out. The <b>field</b> <b>horsetail</b> (E. arvense) can be a nuisance weed, readily regrowing from the rhizome after being pulled out. It is unaffected by many herbicides designed to kill seed plants. However, as E. arvense prefers an acid soil, lime {{may be used to}} assist in eradication efforts to bring the soil pH to 7 or 8. Members of the genus have been declared noxious weeds in Australia and in the US state of Oregon.|$|E
40|$|Scouring {{rush and}} <b>field</b> <b>horsetail</b> are two {{species in the}} Equisetum genus.

40|$|In this paper, {{the study}} of {{antioxidant}} activity and phenolic composition of three different extracts (EtOAc, n-BuOH and H 2 O) of <b>field</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum arvense L.) is presented. The antioxidant activity has been evaluated measuring the total reducing power (expressed by Ascorbate Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity - AEAC), inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and free radical scavenging capacity (RSC) towards 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl (DPPH radical) and nitric oxide (NO), respectively. In addition, the total flavonoid content (TFC) and phenolic constituents of each extract have been determined. The results obtained show that the highest RSC regarding both DPPH and NO radicals is expressed by EtOAc extract (EC 50 = 2. 37 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL and EC 50 = 90. 07 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL, respectively), and the lowest by H 2 O extract (EC 50 = 37. 2 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL and EC 50 > 333. 33 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL, respectively). n- BuOH extract showed the highest total reducing power (AEAC= 13. 40 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL). Differences in the phenolic composition of examined extracts are found comparing the HPLC chemical profiles. Although, isoquercitrin is the main flavonoid in both EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts, {{a considerable amount of}} di-E-caffeoyl-meso-tartaric acid was presented in the n-BuOH extract. In H 2 O extract high content of phenolic acids and low percentage of flavonoids were detected...|$|E
40|$|Kyleo® {{with two}} known active {{substances}} (ai) is an innovative, modern herbicide for resistance management. Kyleo® contains 160 g/l 2, 4 -D and 240 g/l glyphosate. With an application rate of 5, 0 l/ha, {{it shows a}} far better, faster effect on weeds such as <b>field</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum arvense), volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and couch grass (Agropyron repens) compared to a tank mix or the reference products (RP). This is explained by an unique new formulation technology {{that for the first}} time combines 2, 4 -D as acid and glyphosate as MIPA salt together with FHS. The new form of 2, 4 -D is lipophilic with better leaf absorption and greater photolytic degradation in the upper layers of soil. Tests with radioactive marked substances have verified the systemic properties of both ai compared to RP. The displacement of 2, 4 -D into the plant roots was demonstrated 48 h after application (hpt). 98 % glyphosate absorption was observed in rape and couch grass – 10 % (rape) respectively 25 % (couch grass) greater than with RP. Higher absorption of the ai is characterised by a swifter effect, with stronger, visible symptoms after 24 h in rape and 96 h in couch grass. The rainfastness of Kyleo® was tested in greenhouse (GH) trials with rape. Comparability of the test objects was simulated with a uniform glyphosate quantity of 360 g/ha and 10 l/m² simulated precipitation. 24 % improved effect compared to RP was verified for 1 hpt rainfall, while 4 % improved effect was recorded for rain simulation after 6 hpt. GH trials with wheat and a comparable glyphosate application quantity of 290 g/ha revealed differences of 23 % and 22 % compared to RP for rain simulation of 1 hpt and 6 hpt. Kyleo® stands out with a swift effect and better rainfastness. The results presented here prove a systemic mode of action, good rainfastness and swift effect of Kyleo...|$|E
40|$|The Broadbalk {{experiment}} {{was started in}} 1843 to investigate {{the relative importance of}} different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment {{with the exception of the}} 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50 -yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0. 1 -m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991 - 2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(- 1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e. g., black medic and <b>field</b> <b>horsetail),</b> some were slightly disadvantaged (e. g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e. g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established...|$|E
