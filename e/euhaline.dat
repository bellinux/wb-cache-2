40|$|The {{proposition}} {{to introduce}} the AsianoysterCrassostreaariakensis to the mid-Atlantic region of the USA is being considered with caution, particularly after {{the discovery of a}} novel microcell haplosporidian parasite, Bonamiasp., in North Carolina. Although this parasite was found to be pathogenic in C. ariakensis under warm <b>euhaline</b> conditions, its persistence in C. ariakensis exposed to various temperature and salinity combinations remained unresolved. In this laboratory experiment, we tested the influence of temperature in combination {{with a wide range of}} salinities (10, 20 and 30 psu) on Bonamiasp. Temperature was either changed from warm (> 20 °C) to cold (6 °C for 6 weeks) and back to warm or maintained constant and warm. Warm temperature was associated with higher host mortality than cold temperature, suggesting that temperature influenced Bonamiasp. pathogenicity. The effect of salinity was revealed under warm temperature with highest mortality levels observed in infected C. ariakensis exposed to 30 psu. When temperature was increased following low-temperature exposure, Bonamiasp. was not detected; however sub-optimal experimental conditions may have contributed to this result, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the reemergence of the parasite after low-temperature exposure. Although the overwintering of Bonamiasp. in C. ariakensis will need to be further investigated, the results presented here suggest that Bonamiasp. may be able to persist in C. ariakensis under a combination of low temperature and meso- to <b>euhaline</b> salinities. 7 page(s...|$|E

The interest of studding benthic fauna response to extreme events is to obtain useful information on detecting which organisms better reflect ecological status of systems, and, on the other hand, to understand early warning indicators able to function on a sea level rise situation. Meiofaunal communities from two Portuguese estuaries (Mondego and Mira) with different anthropogenic impacts (EFICAS project) were studied, and data collected under different freshwater discharge situations and along the salinity gradient (30), are hoped to reduce knowledge gaps existent on the quantitative distribution of these organisms in Southern European estuaries... In both estuaries, spatial patterns regarding meiofauna abundance and species composition clearly reflected salinity gradients; densities increased from freshwater to seaward areas, and three distinct assemblages were identified: (i) Freshwater areas, where Total meiofauna, Nematoda and Harpaticoids copepods presented the lowest densities in the whole estuary; (ii) Oligohaline and Mesohaline areas, which presented low Total meiobenthic densities and low diversity; (iii) Polyhaline and <b>Euhaline</b> areas, where Meiofauna reached the highest densities and diversity. Although the salinity gradient is strongly linked to sediment’s properties, and the set of environmental and biotic factors created along systems interact to regulate meiofauna communities, other environmental factors, such as granulometry, nutrients concentration and sediment’s organic matter content, were found {{to play an important}} role in structuring meiofauna communities from <b>Euhaline</b> areas of both estuaries. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{transitional}} waters {{the definition of}} reference conditions {{must take into account}} the natural variability. Therefore, prior to the use of environmental quality assessment tools the estuarine stretches reflecting different physical-chemical and biological conditions should be defined in order to correctly establish the benthic specific reference conditions.

The subtidal assemblages (meio- and macrofauna) of the Mira estuary (considered a undisturbed system) were sample in the summer of 2006 and several environmental factors were determined. The environmental factors salinity and the particle size reflect an estuarine gradient. The Nematode and macrobenthos densities and assemblages composition change along the gradient, establishing homogenous sections: (i) the tidal and oligohaline sections are characterised by the presence of freshwater nematodes, the total densities and diversity reach the minimum values; macrobenthos is dominated by Gammarus, Chironomidae and Corbicula fluminae;(ii) in the mesohaline sections the nematode densities is lower and the diversity is poor, the dominant genera are Terschellingia and Sabatieira, Daptonema and Anoplostoma; macrobenthos is dominated by Corophium orientale, Leptocheirus pilosus and Ciathura carinata; (iii) in the polyhaline and <b>euhaline</b> sections the total densities and the diversity are higher, and the Nematode dominant genera are Paracomesoma and Synonchiella; the macrobenthic Heteromastus filiformes, C. orientale and Hediste diversicole are present in the polyhaline section While in the <b>euhaline</b> section the species Nephtys hombergii and Maldanidae are exclusive...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the spatial distribution of subtidal nematode communities along the salinity gradients of two Portuguese estuaries exposed to different degrees of anthropogenic stress: the Mira and the Mondego. The nematode communities were mainly composed of Sabatieria, Metachromadora, Daptonema, Anoplostoma, Sphaerolaimus and Terschellingia species, closely resembling the communities of Northern European estuaries. In both estuaries, nematode density and community composition followed the salinity gradient, naturally establishing three distinct estuarine sections: (i) freshwater and oligohaline – characterised {{by the presence of}} freshwater nematodes, low nematode density and diversity; (ii) mesohaline – dominated by Terschellingia, Sabatieria and Daptonema, with low total density and diversity; and (iii) polyhaline and <b>euhaline</b> – where nematodes reached the highest density and diversity, and Paracomesoma, Synonchiella, and Odontophora were dominant. Despite the similarities in community composition and total nematode density, the proportion of different nematode feeding types were remarkably different in the two estuaries. In Mira, selective deposit feeders were dominant in the oligohaline section, while non-selective deposit feeders were dominant in the other sections. On the contrary, in the Mondego estuary, epigrowth-feeders and omnivores/predators were dominant in the freshwater sections and in the <b>euhaline</b> sector of the southern arm. Differences observed along each estuarine gradient were much stronger than overall differences between the two estuaries. In the Mondego estuary, the influence of anthropogenic stressors seemed not to be relevant in determining the nematodes’ spatial distribution patterns, therefore suggesting that mesoscale variability responded essentially to natural stressors, characteristic of estuarine gradients. Nevertheless, the proportion of the different feeding types was different between the two estuaries, indicating that the response of nematode feeding guilds is able to reflect anthropogenic-induced stress and can be useful in assessing biological quality in transitional waters ecosystems...|$|E

In addition, {{the effect of}} salinity on the variation in seed bank density and similarity between above-ground vegetation and seed bank with depth was compared between <b>euhaline</b> against mesohaline conditions in three salt marshes. Ten plots of 2  m× 2  m were situated in a new salt marsh (existing since 2002) and 80 plots in three old salt marshes. Soil samples were collected at three different depths (0 – 5, 5 – 10, 10 – 15  cm) in spring 2006. Soil seed bank was investigated in germination experiments under greenhouse conditions. Germination experiments lasted 6 months and all seedlings were identified and removed after identification. Above-ground vegetation composition was determined {{during the growing season}} in all plots. Viable seed density was calculated for each plot and for the three different depths; the similarity between seed bank and floristic composition of the above-ground vegetation was calculated. A general linear model was used to investigate the effect of soil depth, salinity and age of the salt marsh on density and similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation. The results showed that seed density decreased with depth in all salt marshes, irrespective of their age and soil salinity. Seed density and similarity between seed bank and above-ground vegetation were higher in the new salt marsh than in the old one in the same study area. This is because in young as well as in old successional stages, the seed bank was mostly composed of new colonizers, while most perennial species were absent from the soil seed bank, although they were dominant in the standing vegetation of the old salt marsh. The characteristics of the seed bank of a mesohaline salt marsh were found not to be fundamentally different from that of both <b>euhaline</b> salt marshes...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the seasonal water use patterns of dominant macrophytes coexisting in the coastal Everglades ecotone. We measured the stable isotope signatures in plant xylem water of Rhizophora mangle, Cladium jamaicense, and Sesuvium portulacastrum during the dry (DS) and wet (WS) seasons in the estuarine ecotone along Taylor River in Everglades National Park, FL, USA. Shallow soilwater and deeper groundwater salinity was also measured to extrapolate the salinity encountered by plants at their rooting zone. Average soil water oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O) was enriched (4. 8 ± 0. 2 ‰) in the DS relative to the WS (0. 0 ± 0. 1 ‰), but groundwater δ 18 O remained constant between seasons (DS: 2. 2 ± 0. 4 ‰; WS: 2. 1 ± 0. 1 ‰). There was an inversion in interstitial salinity patterns across the soil profile between seasons. In the DS, shallow water was <b>euhaline</b> [i. e., 43 practical salinity units (PSU) ] while groundwater was less saline (18 PSU). In the WS, however, shallow water was fresh (i. e., 0 PSU) but groundwater remained brackish (14 PSU). All plants utilized 100 % (shallow) freshwater during the WS, but in the DS R. mangle switched to a soil–groundwater mix (δ 55 % groundwater) while C. jamaicense and S. portulacastrum continued to use <b>euhaline</b> shallow water. In the DS, based on δ 18 O data, the roots of R. mangle roots were exposed to salinities of 25. 4 ± 1. 4 PSU, less saline than either C. jamaicense(39. 1 ± 2. 2 PSU) or S. portulacastrum (38. 6 ± 2. 5 PSU). Although the salinity tolerance of C. jamaicense is not known, it is unlikely that long-term exposure to high salinity is conducive to the persistence of this freshwater marsh sedge. This study increases our ecological understanding of how water uptake patterns of individual plants can contribute to ecosystem levels changes, not only in the southeast saline Everglades, but also in estuaries in general in response to global sea level rise and human-induced changes in freshwater flows...|$|E

Carapace-valve (C/V) ratio, predation, color pattern and ornamentation of the carapace were utilized to study the microenvironment of the area. Based on the C/V ratio, a moderately slow rate of sedimentation is inferred. Predation, a biological factor controlling the abundance and distribution of the community, supports {{the fact that the}} study area is a shallow, inner shelf environment. From the occurrence of a greater number of white and pale yellow colored specimens, it is concluded that sediments are deposited under normal oxygenated conditions. Based on direct observations from Scanning Electron Microscope photographs, the relationship between sculpture in ostracods and grain size of the substrate, is discussed. Among the 4 types of ornate forms recorded in the study area, smooth and fragile forms prefer fine-grained sediments such as sandysilt and silt, whereas highly calcified and ornamented forms prefer coarse-grained siltysand/sandy substrates.

It is not clear that even two genera will be enough to accommodate the species presently drawn to the Haplosporidium regions of the haplosporidian tree. In this review, we summarize recent findings in haplosporidian diversity and phylogenetics, and provide a synthesis of our understanding of the life cycles and environmental influences on haplosporidians, with particular emphasis on the important pathogens Haplosporidium nelsoni and Bonamia ostreae. Additionally, we consider the evolution of the “microcell haplosporidian” lifestyle of Bonamia parasites, and suggest that colonization of high-density oyster host populations in relatively stable <b>euhaline</b> marine environments may have been an important development favoring the evolution of the microcell haplosporidian life strategy...|$|E
40|$|The macrozoobenthic {{assemblage}} {{from the}} Karavasta lagoon system, the main wetland of Albania, was studied on soft bottoms and artificial hard substrates. Three different communities were identified: the typical 'brackish-water community', an 'outlet community' dominated by filter-feeders, and a typical 'marine community', inhabiting fine sandy bottoms, where polychaetes are dominant, {{together with a}} few species of tunicates and bivalves, which colonize hard substrates. The occurrence of build-ups of the bryozoan Conopeum seurati, settled on the upper portion of long submerged wooden poles, was the main feature of faunistic interest. The faunistic affinity between the zoobenthic assemblage recorded in the hyperhaline lagoon of Karavasta and the assemblages from two Italian lagoons, the brackish Lake of Lesina and the <b>euhaline</b> Lake of Fogliano, was considered according to the different hydrological conditions and the geographical location. Hydrological confinement and salinity {{were likely to be}} the leading factors influencing the benthic community composition in the Karavasta wetland area. Therefore, on a vaster spatial scale, the isolation and geographical proximity of the ecosystems and colonizing ability and dispersal changes of the species appear to be the main factors liable to produce faunal variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{otoliths}} of cultured {{sea bass}} (Lates calcarifer) were sampled from 24 locations in Malaysian coastal waters {{in order to}} analyse the ratio values of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Ba/Ca and Zn/Ca. Then the ratio values were discriminated to reconstruct a reliable marker for the migration of wild sea bass. Cultured sea bass was collected from cages and ponds along Malaysian coastal areas from March 2007 to May 2009 with ambient water salinity from oligohaline (0. 1 psu) to <b>euhaline</b> (30 - 35 psu). The {{study found that the}} ratios of Mg/Ca and Zn/Ca in cultured sea bass otoliths were not influenced by the variation in water salinity. However, contradictory pattern value ratios of Ba/Ca in sea bass otoliths were found for the thalassic series. The oligohaline waters were shown to have the highest Ba/Ca ratio with the exception of Sr/Ca ratios in saline waters. This indicates that the concentration of the Sr element is slightly dominant in the otolith whereas the content of Ba was significant with salinity values. The Partition Coefficient (DMe) value also supports the proposition that the Ba element is a good tracer for salinity fluctuations in the otolith as shown by the sea bass migration track along the salinity gradient according to thalassic series. Key words: otolith, Ba/Ca, thalassic series, migratio...|$|E
40|$|The estuarine {{complex of}} Paranaguá - ECP (South Brazil, 25 º 30 'S, 48 º 30 'W) {{is a large}} {{subtropical}} system, where pristine mangrove forests are still present, and fishery and aquaculture are important economic activities. This work investigated the occurrence of harmful algae in Paranaguá Bay, {{as well as the}} presence of toxins in the filter feeding mussel Mytella guyanensis, a local fishery resource. Samples along the Paranaguá sub-system were collected almost monthly from August 2002 to October 2003. Besides physical and chemical variables, cell densities of harmful species and presence of toxins in the mussel by mouse bioassay (DSP, PSP) and HPLC (ASP) were performed. HAB species included Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Dinophysis acuminata,Prorocentrum minimum,Gymnodinium catenatum,Phaeocystis spp., Chattonella spp. and Heterosigma akashiwo. Trichodesmium erythraeum and Coscinodiscus wailesii were also included in this study due to their potential for harmful bloom formation. Toxin results showed the occurrence of DSP (December 2002) in shellfish related to the presence of D. acuminata (max. 4, 566 cells. l- 1). Additionally, cultivated strains produced paralytic and amnesic toxins in laboratory. Spring (October to December, Southern Hemisphere) and late summer (February to April) were the periods of higher abundance of harmful algae, mainly in <b>euhaline</b> and inner polyhaline sectors of the ECP...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSamples from a {{pristine}} {{raised peat bog}} runoff in Austria, the Tannermoor creek, were analysed for their iron linked to natural organic matter (NOM) content. Dissolved organic carbon< 0. 45 μm (DOC) was 41 – 64 mgL− 1, iron 4. 4 – 5. 5 mgL− 1. Samples were analysed applying asymmetric field flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) coupled to UV–vis absorption, fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The samples showed an iron peak associated with the NOM peak, one sample exhibiting a second peak of iron independent from the NOM peak. As highland peat bogs with similar climatic conditions and vegetation to the Tanner Moor are found throughout the world, including areas adjacent to the sea, we examined the behaviour of NOM and iron in samples brought to <b>euhaline</b> (35 ‰) conditions with artificial sea salt. The enhanced ionic strength reduced NOM by 53 % and iron by 82 %. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the samples at sea-like salinity revealed two major fractions of NOM associated with different iron concentrations. The larger one, eluting sharply after the upper exclusion limits of 4000 – 5000 gmol− 1, seems to be most important for iron chelating. The results outline the global importance of sub-mountainous and mountainous raised peat bogs {{as a source of}} iron chelators to the marine environment at sites where such peat bogs release their run-offs into the sea...|$|E
40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} show a {{short and}} peculiar Early Jurassic evolutionary phase {{characterized by the}} Lithiotis sensu lato fauna, mainly represented by the three monospecific genera Lithiotis, Cochlearites and Lithioperna. These bivalves with stick-like or flattened large shells are mostly restricted to the Pliensbachian. They have a wide geographical distribution, occurring both in Tethyan and Panthalassian carbonate platforms, where considerable biogenic accumulations formed. They were common on the Trento Platform (Southern Alps), where they occur in the Rotzo Formation (Calcari Grigi Group). This formation was deposited in a tropical lagoon which was closed seawards by oolitic shoals and bars and bordered landwards by marshes. The Lithiotis s. l. fauna of the Trento Platform seems to be restricted to the upper Pliensbachian. It appeared after a eutrophic phasewith recurrent lowoxygen and brackish conditions and flourished in meso- to oligotrophic waters. The stratigraphic and geographic distributions of each genus are compared to the environmental development of the Rotzo Formation in order to highlight limiting environmental factors and ecological requirements. Lithioperna occurs throughout the whole formation; {{it is the most}} eurytopic genus, well adapted to dysaerobic habitats and with higher ecomorphic plasticity than the other two genera. It frequently occurs in the life position, giving rise to densely packed fan-like or book-like aggregates. Lithiotis required aerobic and <b>euhaline</b> marine conditions and is common in the middle part of the formation where mesotrophic conditions prevailed. This genus is rarely preserved in the theoretical vertical life position probably due to lower shell stability and a less effective attachment modality. Cochlearites is the most common genus of the Rotzo Formation. This genus inhabited <b>euhaline</b> to slightly hypersaline marine environments occurring in {{the upper part of the}} formation, prevailing in oligotrophic conditions. Lithiotis s. l. fauna gave rise to biogenic accumulations with an elevation of a few decimeters to several meters above the sea-bottom and with a lateral extension ranging from ten to several hundred meters. Therefore, these accumulations represent biological build-ups, which document four developmental phases: colonization, aggradation, progradation and demise. The colonization phase is represented by pioneering individuals which were cemented or byssally attached to a bioclastic, coarse-grained stormlayer, which constituted the hard substrate for larval attachment. The aggradation phase produced the core of the build-up and its elevation above the sea-bottom. The core ismostly represented by individuals which acted as bafflers, commonlywith an apparently chaotic fabric. The Lithiotis s. s. and Cochlearites cores are generallymud-supported and contain loosely packed to dispersed specimens, occasionally preserved in life position. The Lithiotis s. s. andCochlearites build-ups can be defined as bivalve mounds. The cores of the Lithioperna build-ups are skeletal-supported with shells mostly preserved in life position, which characterize the bivalve reefs. The prograding phase produced lateral additions to the build-up flanks of oblique and imbricated articulated individuals. The flanks grew centrifugally from the core and represent the most conspicuous part of the build-ups, ranging from 10 to 20 times the size of the core and occasionally extending over several hundred meters...|$|E
40|$|Archaea, {{although}} {{being active}} members of microbial communities, have been poorly characterized in the rhizoplane of wetland plants. In this study, {{we compared the}} archaeal communities found on the root surface of Ruppia spp. and Phragmites australis. Four lagoons, two <b>euhaline</b> andtwo oligohaline, were sampled during two periods of the year. Archaeal communities were investigated by means of 16 SrRNA gene cloning and sequencing. Archaeal sequencesclustered in 171 distinct Operational Taxonomic Units affiliatedto the Euryarchaeota (43 %), Crenarchaeota (36 %) andThaumarchaeota (21 %). Communities found in theunvegetated sediment samples showed a high variabilitymainly due {{to changes in the}} pH and conductivity. Ruppiaspp. roots exhibited a clear selection effect overHalobacteriales (> 80 % of detected sequences) despite thgeographical location and sampling time. In contrast, thearchaeal community on the root surface of Phragmitesaustralis was largely dependent on the sampling locationand time. Methanogenic lineages were not found to be relevantin almost any of the analysed samples. Our findingssuggest that archaeal communities in the root surface of thestudied macrophytes are mainly composed (40 to 86 %) ofputative heterotrophic archaea, such as Halobacteriales,Thermoplasmatales and the Miscellaneous CrenarchaeoticGroupThis work was financially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion through projects ARCANOX (CGL 2009 - 13318) and MACROBIOTECH (CGL 2011 - 23907).
