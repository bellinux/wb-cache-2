40|$|The {{antifungal}} drug, miconazole nitrate, inhibits {{the growth}} of several species of Candida. Candida albicans, one of the pathogenic species, was totally inhibited at a concentration of approximately 10 µg/ml. Endogenous respiration was unaffected by the drug at a concentration as high as 100 µg/ml, whereas <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> was markedly sensitive and inhibited to an extent of 85 %. The permeability of the cell membrane was changed {{as evidenced by the}} leakage of 260 -nm absorbing materials, amino acids, proteins, and inorganic cations. The results we present clearly show that the drug alters the cellular permeability, and thus the <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> becomes sensitive to the drug...|$|E
40|$|When aerobic {{bacteria}} receive a biodegradable material such as wastewater, then respiration changes from endogenous to exogenous. The reverse occurs when biodegradation is complete. When using respirometry a respirogram is recorded showing those changes in respiration, {{and for an}} expert {{it is not difficult}} to point the moments at which they occur. The area corresponding to the <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> phase is a measure of the easily biodegradable fraction of material, also called the short-term BOD or BODST. That value, in combination with a value for COD, can be used to determine the treatability of wastewater. Respirometry can also be applied on-line, e. g. for on-line monitoring of wastewater. However, automatic detection of the end-point of <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> is difficult. The first step towards on-line monitoring of wastewater treatability is to make automatic detection of this end-point possible. In this study the use of a neural network for detection of this end-point was investigated. Results are promising; after training the neural network is able to detect the correct end-point in the majority of the studied case...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of cyclophosphamide and its principal metabolites (CPs) on microbial behaviour in a membrane bioreactor system. Two laboratory-scale membrane bioreactors (MBR) were run in parallel with a sludge retention time of 70 days (one with the cytostatic drugs, MBR-CPs, the second without, MBR-control). The microbial activity was measured by respirometric analysis. The endogenous and exogenous respirations of heterotrophic micro-organisms were evaluated. Micro-organisms exposed to CPs showed higher endogenous respiration rates and lower <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> rates than micro-organisms present in MBR-control. The effects were observed several days after adding the cocktail. Reduced sludge production was observed in MBR-CPs compared to MBR-control. This reduction of sludge production {{and the increase in}} the endogenous respiration rate in relation to MBR-control suggest that the chemical stress caused by CPs led to a diversion of carbon and/or energy from growth to adaptive responses and protection. In addition, the inhibitory effect on the assimilation of exogenous substrate (reduced <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> rate) suggests an inhibition of catabolism and anabolism despite the low CPs concentration studied (μg/L). However, this inhibitory effect can be offset by the biomass still active under low ratio (substrate/biomass) conditions in the bioreactor (due to complete retention of biomass and high sludge age), which helped to maintain high overall performance in the removal of conventional pollution...|$|E
30|$|In this study, we reexamined the {{utilization}} efficiency of exogenous organic substances as a carbon source in C. merolae, which previously {{was thought to}} be an obligate photoautotroph and to not have any transporters for uptake of exogenous compounds. Our results indicate that C. merolae efficiently utilizes various <b>exogenous</b> substrates for <b>respiration</b> and growth, and C. merolae can heterotrophically grow in glycerol-containing medium, but not in medium containing glucose, succinic acid, or lactic acid. We also examined the regulation of respiration by exogenously added organic compounds in cells as a function of flat-plate culture time. Our results suggest that the glycolytic pathway is rate-limiting to respiration, and the activity of the pathway varies dramatically depending on the amount of photosynthetic products.|$|R

Bacteriol. 92 : 905 – 912. 1966. —The {{rates of}} {{endogenous}} and <b>exogenous</b> (glucose) <b>respiration</b> decreased much {{more rapidly than}} did the viable count during the first 24 hr of aging of washed, C 14 -labeled cells of Escherichia coli K- 12 suspended in a basal salt medium devoid of ammonium salts. The rates of decrease of respiration and of death approached each other as {{the age of the}} cells increased, but death was not the only factor involved in decreased respiratory activity of the suspensions. The greatest decrease in cellular contents with aging was noted in the ribonucleic acid fraction, of which the ribose appeared to be oxidized, while uracil accumulated in the suspension medium. The viable count and respiratory activities remained higher in glucose-fed than in nonfed suspensions. Proline-labeled cells fed glucose tended to lose more of their proline and to convert more proline into C 14 O 2 than in unfed controls. On the other hand, uracil-labeled cells fed glucose retained more of the uracil than did nonfed cells, but glucose elicited some oxidation of uracil. An exogenous energy source such as glucose aided in the maintenance of a population, but it was not the only factor needed for such maintenance...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the potential role of mussels in nutrient cycling in oligotrophic fjord ecosystems, we applied a multiple-element (C-N-P-Si) approach considering several physiological processes (excretion, tissue composition, biodeposition) simultaneously. The study covered one annual cycle, reflecting {{the effect of}} endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> factors. <b>Respiration</b> (6 – 29 µmol C g- 1 h- 1), ammonia (0. 3 – 2. 2 µmol N g- 1 h- 1) and phosphate (< 0. 3 µmol P g- 1 h- 1) excretion were correlated to food (POC) and temperature. Tissue nitrogen (127 – 167 mg N g- 1), carbon (547 – 629 mg C g- 1) and phosphorus content (547 – 629 mg P g- 1) seemed related to reproductive processes. Nutrient turnover showed a seasonal pattern with fast turnover in summer and slow turnover in winter. On an annual basis, nitrogen turnover (643 days) was slower compared to phosphorus (290 days) and carbon (181 days). Fluctuations in biodeposition rates (11 – 72 mg g- 1) were correlated to food parameters. Although the food concentration in our study area was low (Chl a < 2 µg l- 1; POC < 546 µg l- 1) and food quality high (CN ~ 9), physiological rates, except biodeposition, were similar to rates reported in other cultivation areas. The relative importance {{of each of the}} processes determines how mussels contribute to nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems. Respiration and excretion of dissolved metabolites (1639 mg C, 92 mg N, 23 mg P g- 1 y- 1) is regarded as a source of regenerated nutrients and may enhance nutrient availability in the euphotic zone with potential consequences for phytoplankton dynamics. Nutrient accumulation in tissue material (560 mg C, 168 mg N, 12 mg P g- 1 y- 1) is regarded as a sink of nutrients given that mussels will be harvested. Biodeposition (981 mg C, 113 mg N, 9 mg P g- 1 y- 1) is regarded as another nutrient sink in fjord ecosystems, although a fraction is regenerated in the euphotic zone. This shows a dissimilar allocation of elements to each of the physiological processes, resulting in relatively more nitrogen being accumulated in tissue material, and relatively more phosphorus being regenerated. The relatively high fraction of regenerated nutrients (25 – 53 %) and the low fraction of nutrients allocated to biodeposition (20 – 31 %) indicates that the potential role of mussels in nutrient cycling in oligotrophic fjord systems is different from shallow eutrophic areas...|$|R

COD removal efficiency about 85 % was achieved after 6 hours of ozonation of the synthetic wastewater. The best fit of experimental COD data during ozonation was achieved with the zero order reaction kinetic model. Ozonation of MBT had {{positive influence on}} increase of biodegradability and respiration activity of activated sludge {{in the presence of}} wastewater after ozonation.

40|$|A {{purified}} antitumor protein {{from the}} proteinaceous crystal of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis inhibits {{the growth of}} Yoshida ascites sarcoma both in vivo and in vitro. <b>Exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> of the tumor cells was unaffected by the protein at a concentration as high as 500 µg/ml. The antitumor protein inhibits the uptake and incorporation of labeled precursors into macromolecules. However, the ratio of incorporation over uptake is not affected by the protein. Further, the protein brings about the leakage of 260 -nm-absorbing material, proteins, and 32 P-labeled cellular constituents from the Yoshida ascites sarcoma cells.

The pre-washed cells were applied for measurement of the phenol and oxygen uptake rates at varied starting phenol concentrations with the kinetic parameters calculated using the Haldane model. The results revealed that nutrient limitation significantly suppressed the maximum value of <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> rate while the endogenous respiration rate, affinity and tolerance to phenol increased. By contrast, cell starvation resulted in a drop of both the exogenous and endogenous respiration rates by an order of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Cr(VI) -induced toxicity in {{plants and animals}} has been assessed for mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane damage in turnip root and rat liver mitochondria. By using succinate as the respiratory substrate, ADP/O and respiratory control ratio (RCR) were depressed {{as a function of}} Cr(VI) concentration. State 3 and uncoupled respiration were also depressed by Cr(VI). Rat mitochondria revealed a higher sensitivity to Cr(VI), as compared to turnip mitochondria. Rat mitochondrial state 4 respiration rate triplicated in contrast to negligible stimulation of turnip state 4 respiration. Chromium(VI) inhibited the activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) from rat liver mitochondria and succinate-dehydrogenases (complex II) from plant and animal mitochondria. In rat liver mitochondria, complex I was more sensitive to Cr(VI) than complex II. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was not sensitive to Cr(VI). Unique for plant mitochondria, <b>exogenous</b> NADH uncoupled <b>respiration</b> was unaffected by Cr(VI), indicating that the NADH dehydrogenase of the outer leaflet of the plant inner membrane, in addition to complexes III and IV, were insensitive to Cr(VI). The ATPase activity (complex V) was stimulated in rat liver mitochondria, but inhibited in turnip root mitochondria. In both, turnip and rat mitochondria, Cr(VI) depressed mitochondrial succinate-dependent transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and phosphorylation efficiency, but it neither affected mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to protons (H+) nor induced membrane lipid peroxidation. However, Cr(VI) induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to K+, an effect that was more pronounced in turnip root than in rat liver mitochondria. In conclusion, Cr(VI) -induced perturbations of mitochondrial bioenergetics compromises energy-dependent biochemical processes and, therefore, may contribute to the basal mechanism underlying its toxic effects in plant and animal cells. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The {{respiratory}} pigments of Prototheca zopfii include seven cytochromes: two c-type cytochromes, a soluble c(549) and a membrane bound c(551); three b-type cytochromes, b(555), b(559) and b(564); and cytochromes a and a 3. Cytochromes a and a 3 {{could be}} resolved spectrally in the α-band region {{by reducing the}} cells {{in the presence of}} methanol and cyanide. Methanol shifted the absorption maximum of cytochrome a from 598 to 603 nanometers and permitted dithionite (or substrate) to reduce the cyanide-cytochrome a 3 complex to give a well defined 595 -nanometer absorption band. Methanol did not interfere with CO binding by cytochrome a 3, and CO did not alter the methanol effect on cytochrome a. Azide and cyanide, which partially inhibited <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration,</b> stimulated endogenous respiration. Frozen steady states of the electron transport chain in the presence of cyanide and azide indicated that the stimulation by these inhibitors was due to an increased autooxidation of one of the b-type cytochromes, possibly b(564) ...|$|E

The incubation systems contained no products of incomplete oxidation of the sub-strates and, with the results obtained from using uncoupling agents (sodium azide and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol), {{it appeared that the}} low gas ex-change values were due to concurrent oxidative assimilation from the substrates. Oxidative assimilation has been studied with many bacterial species and the subject has been reviewed by Clifton (1952, 1957). Barker (1936) studied the oxidation of substrates by the color-less alga Prototheca zopfii, and formulated the problem of correcting for endogenous respiration when studying microbial assimilation, mano-metrically. He stated that "one may take that method of correction to be most basically correct which when applied to all vessels gives the most constant value of oxygen consumption per unit quantity of substrate decomposed. " The validity of subtracting endogenous values in calculating oxygen uptake figures for substrates removed by cells has been reviewed and discussed by Wilner and Clifton (1954).

40|$|Hexachlorophene (HCP) {{inhibits}} both endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> (oxygen uptake) in Bacillus megaterium, without sparing by any {{of several}} substrates. The inhibition is maximal when the cells are treated with 8 μg of HCP per mg of cells (dry weight), which corresponds to the minimal lethal dose. Levels as low as 2 μg/mg are inhibitory but not lethal. HCP also inhibits the respiration of isolated B. megaterium membranes and can act on several components of the electron transport chain in the membranes and on soluble enzymes. Although both forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form dehydrogenase and malic dehydrogenase are inhibited by HCP, they are less susceptible than is oxygen uptake. The site of maximal sensitivity is nearer the terminal electron acceptor, but the exact location depends on the cytochrome composition of the membranes. If cytochromes b 1, a, and a 3 are present, but not o, HCP inhibits electron transport on the substrate side of cytochrome b 1; if cytochromes b 1, a 3, and o are present, but not a, the inhibition occurs on the oxygen side of cytochrome b 1. Exogenous menadione, an analogue of menaquinone, reverses the inhibition in both circumstances. The primary lethal action of HCP thus appears to be respiratory inhibition at a site within the membrane-bound part of the electron transport chain...|$|E
40|$|Ketoconazole, an {{antifungal}} drug, completely inhibited {{the growth}} of Candida albicans 7 N at concentrations of {{greater than or equal}} to 50 microgram/ml (94 microM). However, ketoconazole incompletely inhibited {{the growth of}} this opportunistic yeast at concentrations of 25 to 0. 2 microgram/ml (47 to 0. 4 microM). At these lower concentrations, 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, an electron acceptor, was reduced by several strains of C. albicans. This effect resulted in red coloration of colonies. Concomitantly, this phenomenon was not antagonized in the presence of ergosterol. Furthermore, neither ketoconazole nor antimycin A inhibited the growth of C. albicans under anaerobic conditions, as revealed by a paper disk method. Ketoconazole at the concentrations stated above inhibited endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> immediately after it was added to a system containing log phase C. albicans cells, as determined polarographically. At the same time, ketoconazole inhibited the activity of NADH oxidase at the mitochondrial level. In contrast, higher concentrations of ketoconazole (greater than 100 microM) were required to inhibit the activity of succinate oxidase from rat liver mitochondria. In addition, concentrations of ketoconazole greater than 100 microM were required to impair the uptake of labeled leucine and adenine and, subsequently, the incorporation of the former into protein and the latter into DNA and RNA in intact cells. On the other hand, ketoconazole at concentrations of 10, 1. 0, and 0. 4 microM had no effect on either membrane permeability or macromolecular synthesis...|$|E

It is often difficult to know the way the clay is exerting its influence and whether its presence improves a given metabolic process The present work concerns the study of the effect of the addition of Powdered kaolin to autotrophic nitrification systems, and includes the study {{of the effects of the}} particles on the activity of a suspended nitrifying bacteria consortium and on the performance of an air-lift biofilm reactor used for tertiary nitrification. Concerning the suspended culture, kaolin particles produced stimulation on the specific endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> rates of the bacteria, probably due to a nutritional effect supplied by the clay. This effect was more pronounced for the ammonia oxidation rates, although nitrite oxidation was also enhanced but to a lesser extent. In respect to the presence of kaolin particles in the air-lift reactor, the results obtained indicate that the clay particles become incorporated in the biofilm pellets, but do not change significantly their thickness or their shape. However, nitrate production decreased when the concentration of particles increased. The low adsorption of ammonia by the kaolin indicated that the clay particles embedded in the biofilm did not probably retain the ions.

40|$|Pyrrolnitrin at 10 μg/ml {{inhibited}} {{the growth}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Penicillium atrovenetum, and P. oxalicum. The primary site of action of pyrrolnitrin on S. cerevisiae was the terminal electron transport system between succinate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and coenzyme Q. At growth inhibitory concentrations, pyrrolnitrin inhibited endogenous and <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> immediately after its addition to the system. In mitochondrial preparations, the antibiotic inhibited succinate oxidase, NADH oxidase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, NADH-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate-coenzyme Q 6 reductase. In addition, pyrrolnitrin inhibited the antimycin-insensitive reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol and of the tetrazolium dye 2, 2 ′-di-p-nitrophenyl-(3, 3 ′-dimethoxy- 4, 4 ′-bi-phenylene) 5, 5 ′-diphenylditetrazolium. The reduction of another tetrazolium dye, 2 -p-iodophenyl- 3 -p-nitrophenyl- 5 -phenyltetrazolium chloride, that was antimycin-sensitive, was also inhibited by pyrrolnitrin. The antibiotic {{had no effect on}} the activity of cytochrome oxidase, and it did not appear to bind with flavine adenine dinucleotide, the coenzyme of succinic dehydrogenase. In whole cells of S. cerevisiae, pyrrolnitrin inhibited the incorporation of 14 C-glucose into nucleic acids and proteins. It also inhibited the incorporation of 14 C-uracil, 3 H-thymidine, and 14 C-amino acids into ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, and protein, respectively. The in vitro protein synthesis in Rhizoctonia solani and Escherichia coli was not affected by pyrrolnitrin. Pyrrolnitrin also inhibited the uptake of radioactive tracers, but there was no general damage to the cell membranes that would result in an increased leakage of cell metabolites. Apparently, pyrrolnitrin inhibits fungal growth by inhibiting the respiratory electron transport system...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{bioreactor}} (MBR) {{is increasingly}} used for municipal wastewater treatment and reuse and great concerns {{have been raised}} to some emerging trace pollutants found in aquatic environment in the last decade, notably the pharmaceuticals. As a consequence the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants by MBRs has been extensively investigated. But {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge on the effects of the current presence of pharmaceutical micropollutants in domestic wastewaters on MBR fouling. Among the different pharmaceuticals, it was decided to focus on carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug, because of its occurrence in domestic wastewaters and persistency in biological processes including MBRs. This paper focuses on the effects of continuous carbamazepine pollution on MBR fouling. A continuous introduction of CBZ into the MBR via the feed (about 90 mu g L- 1 CBZ in the feed) provoked a TMP jump. It occurred just 1 day after the addition of CBZ in MBR and a significantly higher increase rate of TMP was also observed after 1 day after addition of CBZ in MBR, as compared to that before addition of CBZ. This indicates that the pharmaceutical stress induced by CBZ causes more severe membrane fouling. Addition of CBZ was shown to induce a significant increase of the concentration of proteins in the supernatant at the beginning several days then stabilized to original level whereas no significant change was found for polysaccharides. HPLC-SEC analysis showed that addition of CBZ induced a decrease of 100 - 1000 kDa protein-like SMPs and a more significant increase of 10 - 100 kDa protein-like SMPs in the supernatant. Moreover it was found that addition of CBZ in the MBR affected the sludge microbial activities, as a slight inhibition (about 20 %) of the <b>exogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> rate was observed. The increased membrane fouling could be related to the change in biomass characteristics and supernatant quality after addition of CBZ in MBR. This study allows also suggesting that 10 - 100 kDa protein-like SMPs might accumulate inside the biocake that was formed on the membrane surface during MBR operation and {{play an important role in}} the TMP jump phenomenon...|$|E
