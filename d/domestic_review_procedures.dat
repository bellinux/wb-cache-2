40|$|Every {{human being}} has the {{inherent}} right to life. However, {{the death penalty}} is the severest penalty and deprives the convicted person of his life. Against the background of more and more countries abolishing the death penalty, it is necessary for China, the nation with the highest number of executions as reported by International Amnesty, to examine its policy on the death penalty. This article consists of four parts. Part One introduces the court system and the trial process in China, with a view to help understand the current practice of handling criminal cases. Part Two review the historical development of the <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> for the death penalty in the People’s Republic of China since its foundation. Part Three examines the problems with the <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> in practice. Part Four contains recommendations for the improvement of the <b>review</b> <b>procedure.</b> It is submitted that the power of reviewing death penalty cases (especially cases involving immediate execution) should be subject to ultimate decision by the Supreme People’s Court. On the basis that China is not yet ready to abolish the death penalty, it is argued that it should restrict the availability and <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> of the death penalty, insist on fewer and more considered executions, prevent wrongful executions and thus better protect the human rights of defendants. Without these additional protections, the procedure can only be a formality in practice rather than the ‘last straw’ envisaged by la...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to open up the black box of peer review and to {{increase}} its transparency, understanding, and credibility. To this end, two arguments will be presented: First, epistemic and social aspects of peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> are inseparable and mutually constitutive. Second, a content analysis of written reviews indicates that certain elements of peer culture from the 17 th century are still active in the scientific community. These arguments are illustrated by a case study on the peer review practices of a national funding institution, the Swiss National Science Foundation. Based on the case study and the two arguments it will be concluded more generally that peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> show a distinctive specificity to the reviewed objects (e. g. papers or proposals), the organisational format (e. g. panels or external reviewers), or the surrounding context (e. g. disciplinary or interdisciplinary). Scientists, administrators, and the public may conclude that appraising peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> should not be done by way of general principals but should be based on concrete factual knowledge on the specific process under discussion...|$|R
