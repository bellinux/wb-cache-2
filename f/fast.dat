50|$|The {{first day}} of Shawwāl is Eid al-Fitr.

Despite missing time from his injury, <b>Fast</b> ranked seventh on the team in assists, fourth in goals, and second in plus-minus with +14.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>fasting</b> between Days 8 and 16 of the estrous cycle on plasma {{concentrations}} of luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone, cortisol, glucose and insulin were determined in 4 <b>fasted</b> and 4 control heifers during an estrous cycle of <b>fasting</b> {{and in the}} subsequent cycle after <b>fasting.</b> Cortisol levels were unaffected by <b>fasting.</b> Concentrations of insulin and glucose, however, were decreased (p<O. 05) by 12 and 36 h, respectively, after <b>fasting</b> was begun and {{did not return to}} control values until 12 h (insulin) and 4 to 7 days (glucose) after <b>fasting</b> ended. Concentrations of progesterone were greater (p<O. 05) in <b>fasted</b> than in control heifers from Day 10 to 15 of the estrous cycle during <b>fasting,</b> while LH levels were lower (p< 0. 01) in <b>fasted</b> than in control heifers during the last 24 h of <b>fasting.</b> Concentrations of LH increased (p<O. 01) abruptly in <b>fasted</b> heifers in the first 4 h after they were refed on Day 16 of the <b>fasted</b> cycle. Concentrations (X ± SE) of LH also were greater (p<O. 05) in <b>fasted</b> (11. 2 ± 2. 6 ng/ml) than in control (4. 7 ± 1. 2 ng/ml) heifers during estrus of the cycle after fasting; this elevated LH was preceded by a rebound response in insulin levels in the fasted-refed heifers, with insulin increasing from 176 ± 35 pg/ml to 1302 ± 280 pg/ml between refeeding and estrus of the cycle after <b>fasting.</b> Concentrations of LH, glucose and insulin were similar in both groups after Day 2 of the postfasting cycle. Concentrations of progesterone in two <b>fasted</b> heifers and controls were similar during the cycle after <b>fasting,</b> whereas concentrations in the other <b>fasted</b> heifers were less than 1 ng/ml until Day 10, indicating delayed ovulation and (or) reduced luteal function.

30|$|The {{comparison}} of the performances of the best competitors ever leads to different findings in contrast to comparing sex differences over time between the annual <b>fastest.</b> For example, for the ‘English Channel Swim’, Eichenberger et al.

Similarly, Fischer et al. (2013) considered the mean swim times of all successful female and male swimmers where no difference in swim times was found. However, when the <b>fastest</b> ever, the three <b>fastest</b> ever and the ten <b>fastest</b> ever in the ‘English Channel Swim’ were considered, men were always <b>faster</b> than women (Fischer et al. 2013). When the annual three <b>fastest</b> {{women and men in}} the ‘English Channel Swim’ were compared, men were ~ 12.5 % <b>faster</b> during the 1975 – 2011 period (Fischer et al. 2013).
