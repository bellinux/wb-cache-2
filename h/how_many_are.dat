5|$|The Xscape {{match is}} the third {{specialty}} match primarily used in TNA. It is held annually at TNA's Lockdown PPV event in April—an all–steel cage format PPV event. The first two Xscape matches were held {{to determine the number}} one contender to the TNA X Division Championship, while, since 2007, it has been contested for the X Division Championship. The contest involves four to six participants. To win this match, two or more participants—depending on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> involved in the encounter—must be eliminated by pinfall or submission leaving only two participants. These two men then race to see who escapes the cage first to claim victory.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

There are many regional variations on the rhyme, which means {{that it is impossible to}} give a definitive version.|$|E

25|$|Police {{announced}} on 23 June 2017 that {{the root of}} the fire was a model FF175BP fridge-freezer produced under the Hotpoint brand for Whirlpool. Owners of the types FF175BP and FF175BG were urged to register their appliance with the manufacturer to receive any updates. Sixty-four thousand of these models were made between March 2006 and July 2009, after which the model was discontinued. It is unknown <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> still in use.|$|E
25|$|Since {{no records}} are kept or {{required}} to be kept of how many disruptions occur beyond those filed in court, which are confidential, {{there is no way}} to be sure <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> occurring. Anecdotal evidence, however, has suggested that while they may have decreased as a whole through 1997 (when the Adoption and Safe Families Act was passed), for adoptions of Eastern-European born children they may well have increased, and thus the rate may have stabilized.|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even {{though he did not}} ask <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> for conviction and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected in the trial court.|$|R

25|$|Some {{universities}} incorporate missions {{into the}} game play to encourage more active participation. These missions usually come with a reward for the winning side. This reward could benefit the winners or it could penalize the losing side, and thus benefit the winning side. Missions can easily be modified in-game to account for how many players are humans and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> zombies, or to make the mission easier for one side and/or harder for the opposing side. Missions can also be constructed to follow a storyline throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{all classes}} and skill levels racers also {{receive the same}} number of points {{depending}} on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those who make the mains will get 8 points, including the last place finisher. If the class has 15 racers, all who make the main will get 15 points. So the winner of the Intermediate class will get 15 points for the fifteen racers in that class on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points.|$|E

2500|$|A related {{problem is}} the {{partition}} problem, {{a variant of the}} knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one metric ton). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible? ...|$|E

2500|$|Rod McKenzie, {{the editor}} of BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, {{observed}} on the BBC Editors' weblog (see Further reading) that audience reactions to Brand's and Ross's remarks had been polarised, noting that whilst his colleagues at Radio 4, Radio 5 Live, television, and the BBC World Service had been seeing one thing, the younger audiences of Radio 1 had been reacting quite differently, and were broadly supportive of Ross and Brand. Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that [...] "he financial markets are wrecked and all {{he can do is}} talk about a petty joke." [...] Others stated that people should [...] "calm down", [...] "get a grip", and that the subject had been [...] "blown out of all proportion". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing [...] "anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics." [...] He stated that for the people who worked in the media [...] "profile and salary-envy and [...] may play a part in all this.

2500|$|One of {{the more}} unusual marine mammals living in the Persian Gulf is the dugong (Dugong dugon). Also called [...] "sea cows" [...] for their grazing habits, their mild manner and {{resemblance}} to the livestock, dugongs have a life expectancy {{similar to that of}} humans and can reach lengths of up to [...] These gentle mammals feed on the sea grass and closer relatives of certain land mammals than the dolphins and the whales. Despite the simplicity of their grass diet, new developments along the Persian Gulf coastline, particularly artificial island development in Arab states, pollution particularly by oil spills caused during the [...] "Persian Gulf war" [...] and also due to occasional oil spills, and uncontrolled hunting has had a negative impact on the survival of the dugongs. After Australian waters with some 80,000 dugong inhabitants, the waters off Qatar, Bahrain, UAE, and Saudi Arabia have some 7,500 dugongs remaining, making the Persian Gulf the second most important habitat for the species. Dugong's current number is dwindling and it is not clear <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> currently alive or what their reproductive trend is. Unfortunately, ambitious and uncalculated construction schemes, political unrest and an ever-present international conflict, and presence of the most lucrative world supply of oil, along with lack of cooperation between Arab states and Iran, has had a negative impact on the survival of many marine species, including dugongs.|$|E
