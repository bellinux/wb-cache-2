5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
25|$|Almost any laser active <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> can be pumped {{to produce}} gain for {{light at the}} {{wavelength}} of a laser made with the same material as its <b>gain</b> <b>medium.</b> Such amplifiers are commonly used to produce high power laser systems. Special types such as regenerative amplifiers and chirped-pulse amplifiers are used to amplify ultrashort pulses.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} physical mechanisms {{that can be}} used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier's <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), electron-hole recombination occurs. In Raman amplifiers, Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. Parametric amplifiers use parametric amplification.|$|E

25|$|Scintillation {{is defined}} {{a flash of}} light {{produced}} in a transparent material by the passage of a particle (an electron, an alpha particle, an ion, or a high-energy photon). Stilbene and derivatives are used in scintillation counters to detect such particles. Stilbene {{is also one of the}} <b>gain</b> <b>mediums</b> used in dye lasers.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{solid-state}} lasers {{can also}} be tunable using several intracavity techniques which employ etalons, prisms, and gratings, {{or a combination of}} these. [...] Titanium-doped sapphire is widely used for its broad tuning range, 660 to 1080 nanometers. Alexandrite lasers are tunable from 700 to 820 nm, and they yield higher-energy pulses than titanium-sapphire lasers because of the <b>gain</b> <b>medium's</b> longer energy storage time and higher damage threshold.|$|R
25|$|The {{leading edge}} of the pulse is amplified, until the {{saturation}} energy of the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> is reached. In some condition, the width (FWHM) of the pulse is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{powering}} some diode lasers {{is the use}} of optical pumping. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSL) use a III-V semiconductor chip as the <b>gain</b> <b>medium,</b> and another laser (often another diode laser) as the pump source. OPSL offer several advantages over ILDs, particularly in wavelength selection and lack of interference from internal electrode structures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{intracavity}} {{elements are}} usually placed at a beam waist between folded sections. Examples include acousto-optic modulators for cavity dumping and vacuum spatial filters for transverse mode control. For some low power lasers, the laser <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> itself may be positioned at a beam waist. Other elements, such as filters, prisms and diffraction gratings often need large quasi-collimated beams.|$|E
40|$|We present {{practical}} modeling for edged-pumped {{high power}} solid-state slab lasers. Both analytic and ray tracing methods {{were used to}} analyze the distributions of absorbed pump power using real broad spectrum diode laser pump sources. The resulting thermal and stress distributions were calculated with finite element analysis. Our analyses include the temperature dependence of the <b>gain</b> <b>medium's</b> thermal conductivity and expansion coefficient. Nd:YAG and Yb:YAG were then compared for use as gain media for high power solid state slab laser. 入藏号: WOS: 00018424130000...|$|R
40|$|Diode lasers used to pump high {{average power}} {{solid-state}} lasers typically have broad spectral width so {{that most of}} the pump light is not {{at the peak of the}} <b>gain</b> <b>medium's</b> absorption feature. However, the long absorption length in these lasers enables even weakly absorbed light to pump efficiently. The result is that high absorption efficiency and improved pump distribution uniformity are possible when using realistic pump diodes. In addition, both quantities are nearly independent of the pump center wavelength...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transient}} {{regime of}} {{a new type of}} free-running Nd: YAG laser including two spatial filters in order to synthesize an unusual transverse mode is studied. The laser is seeded by a short (30 ps) laser pulse, and a streak camera analyses the transverse beam profile after each cavity round-trip. The expected filtered mode is obtained after approximately 15 round-trips. This result shows the ability of this original filtering to be used by others emission regimes and <b>gain</b> <b>mediums...</b>|$|R
25|$|Out of plane {{resonators}} lead to {{rotation of}} the beam profile and more stability. The heat generated in the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> leads to frequency drift of the cavity, therefore the frequency can be actively stabilized by locking it to unpowered cavity. Similarly the pointing stability of a laser may still be improved by spatial filtering by an optical fibre.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescein is a {{fluorophore}} {{commonly used}} in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the <b>gain</b> <b>medium,</b> in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494nm and emission maximum of 512nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite.|$|E
25|$|In optics, an ultrashort {{pulse of}} light is an {{electromagnetic}} pulse whose time duration {{is of the}} order of a picosecond (1012 second) or less. Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. They are commonly referred to as ultrafast events. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> of the amplifier.|$|E
50|$|A laser of a {{suitable}} type {{can be used}} to pump another laser. The pump laser's narrow spectrum gives it much more efficient energy transfer than flashlamps. Diode lasers pump solid state lasers and liquid dye lasers. A ring laser design is often used, especially in dye lasers. The ring laser uses three or more mirrors to reflect light in a circular path. This helps eliminate the standing wave generated by most Fabry-Pérot resonators, leading to a better use of the <b>gain</b> <b>medium's</b> energy.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new all-optical gate device {{integrating}} a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the cavity of a mode-locked laser diode. The device utilizes semiconductor optical amplifiers {{not only as}} <b>gain</b> <b>mediums</b> for the mode-locked emission but also as phase shifters for optical switching with the interferometer. The gate opens and shuts with the internal mode-locked optical pulses, {{eliminating the need for}} an external optical clock pulse for the switching. Gate timing can be synchronized to input data signals when the saturable absorber with passive mode-locked setup absorbs signal pulses. This function-integrated optical device will aid in reducing the size of future high-bit-rate data processing systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{reflective}} {{characteristics of}} a multimode fiber Bragg grating (MM-FBG) and the changes of reflective spectra with mode excitation conditions in the multi-mode fiber were investigated. Two multiwavelength fiber laser configurations using offset launch technique to MM-FBG with hybrid <b>gain</b> <b>mediums</b> are proposed and demonstrated. Different multiwavelength outputs were obtained by variation of the spatial launching position of the single-mode fiber against the MM-FBG to achieve different mode group excitation. The first laser employs one MM-FBG in the ring cavity, achieving seven output wavelengths with a wavelength spacing of 0. 76 nm. The second laser comprises two MM-FBGs connected in parallel, yielded 10 output wavelengths. Department of Electrical EngineeringDepartment of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below the threshold of the nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E
25|$|In a laser, the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> emits light {{randomly}} in all directions. With {{a classical}} cavity, {{the number of}} photons which are coupled into a single cavity mode relative to {{the total number of}} photons spontaneously emitted photons is relatively low because of the geometric inefficiency of the cavity, described by the Purcell factor Q/Vmode. The rate at which lasing in such a cavity can be modulated depends on the relaxation frequency of the resonator described by equation 1.|$|E
25|$|If {{the optical}} cavity is not empty (e.g., a laser cavity which {{contains}} the <b>gain</b> <b>medium),</b> {{the value of}} L used is not the physical mirror separation, but the optical path length between the mirrors. Optical elements such as lenses placed in the cavity alter the stability and mode size. In addition, for most gain media, thermal and other inhomogeneities create a variable lensing effect in the medium, which {{must be considered in}} the design of the laser resonator.|$|E
40|$|A major {{consideration}} in most laser resonator designs for high power is {{to obtain the}} maximum far field irradiance on a target. Various design approaches have emerged {{in recent years to}} optimize the far-field irradiance by utilizing different resonator concepts for the purpose of obtaining the best mode control and near field beam quality. The different concepts utilize annular and compacted <b>gain</b> <b>mediums,</b> spatial filtering techniques, novel optical components and adaptive optics. This paper will describe recent results using intracavity adaptive optical techniques versus extracavity adaptive optical techniques. Experimental results will be provided which will show the correction capability for low order aberrations (tilt and astigmatism) commonly found in high energy lasers. A comparison of several optimization control techniques using a multidither zonal COAT system will be discussed describing the effects of hardware limitations and considerations on the performance of the system...|$|R

25|$|The {{process is}} {{identical}} in form to atomic absorption {{in which the}} energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a <b>gain</b> <b>medium,</b> along with an optical resonator, {{is at the heart}} of a laser or maser.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} doped with certain rare-earth {{elements}} such as erbium {{can be used as}} the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> of a laser or optical amplifier. Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal amplification by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is optically pumped with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor optical {{amplifiers}} (SOAs) are amplifiers {{which use}} a semiconductor {{to provide the}} <b>gain</b> <b>medium.</b> These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted wave guide and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which {{is greater than the}} gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry {{in order to reduce the}} power density on the output facet.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{simultaneous}} multi-wavelength-band common-path optical frequency domain imaging is proposed for spectroscopic applications. Simultaneous multi-band wavelength tuning {{can be performed}} by using multiple fiber-ring cavities with corresponding optical semiconductor amplifier as their <b>gain</b> <b>mediums</b> and narrowband optical filters with a single polygonal scanner for synchronization. A simultaneous 1310 / 1550 dual-band swept laser source is constructed as a proof concept prototype. Broadband 1310 / 1550 wavelength-division multiplexing is used for coupling two wavelengths into a common-path single-mode GRIN-lensed fiber probe to form a dual-band common-path optical frequency domain imaging. Simultaneous imaging at 1310 and 1550 nm is achieved by using a depth ratio correction method. This technique allows potential for in vivo endoscopic high-speed functional optical frequency domain imaging with high quality spectroscopic contrast with low computational costs. On the other hand, the common path configuration is able to suppress common mode noise and potentially implement high stability quantitative phase measurements.

40|$|A {{simple and}} high-efficiency method for direct {{generation}} of all-solid-state single- and dual-vortex lasers operating at eye-safe wavelengths is {{reported in a}} compact diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser cavity. By off-axis pumping of the Nd:YAG in two orthogonal directions, the original cavity mode, fundamental Gaussian mode (TEM 00), is directly transformed into first-order Laguerre-Gaussian (LG 01) mode with single- or dual-vortex structures depending {{on the degree of}} the off-axis pumping. Moreover, the single- and dual-vortex lasers can be produced in simultaneous eye-safe dual-wavelength operation with the aid of an intracavity etalon. At the same time, a novel method to determine the handedness of achieved vortex lasers by using a plane-concave mirror with suitable coating is also proposed. This method can be perfectly applied to generate vortex lasers at other emissions bands for various applications by using different laser <b>gain</b> <b>mediums.</b> This work paves a general way to simple and efficient realization and determination of vortex lasers...|$|R
25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin <b>gain</b> <b>medium,</b> these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E

2500|$|In CPA, on {{the other}} hand, an ultrashort laser pulse is {{stretched}} out in time prior to introducing it to the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> using a pair of gratings that are arranged so that the low-frequency component of the laser pulse travels a shorter path than the high-frequency component does. After going through the grating pair, the laser pulse becomes positively chirped, that is, the high-frequency component lags behind the low-frequency component, and has longer pulse duration than the original {{by a factor of}} 103 to 105. Then the stretched pulse, whose intensity is sufficiently low compared with the intensity limit of gigawatts per square centimeter, is safely introduced to the <b>gain</b> <b>medium</b> and amplified by a factor 106 or more.
