5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|Alexander III's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and {{after two years of}} deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.|$|E

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> had rights to grain, knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the grantor to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|E
25|$|The Germanic law {{codes are}} {{designed}} for a clearly stratified society fixated on castes determined by descent or kinship. Legal status, and therefore freedom, {{was based on a}} person's caste, discriminating between royals and two or three successive castes of nobility, where the lower were reckoned as peasants or freemen (OE freo man, OHG frīhals), and those who are laymen, or bondmen (ON þræll). Accordingly, descent (nativitate) was <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> would attend the various things (house-things, local things, regional things and inter-regional or royal things). Thus the bondmen were ipso facto represented by their family-heads - the local nobility - on the regional things of the nobles. The same differentiation (in castes) defined who could convey and inherit property. In regulation of tribal feuds and weregeld a similar discrimination is seen.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared.|$|E

25|$|Big Brother is a {{television}} reality game show {{based on an}} originally Dutch TV series {{of the same name}} created by producer John de Mol in 1997. The series follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who are living together in a custom-built home under constant surveillance. The HouseGuests are completely isolated from the outside world and can have no communication with those not in the house. The contestants are competing for a $500,000 grand prize, with weekly competitions and evictions <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> will win the show. The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984). The series launched on July 5, 2000 to a successful start, though ratings and critical reaction continued to grow increasingly negative. This led to the second season being a revamp of the show, featuring a more competition-based challenge. The series has since continued to be a hit for CBS, and is the second longest-running adaptation of the series to date, after the Spanish adaptation.|$|E
25|$|To {{fill the}} Canucks' roster for their inaugural season, the league held an Expansion Draft in the {{preceding}} summer. A draft lottery was held on June 9, 1970, <b>determining</b> <b>who</b> between the Canucks and Sabres would get the first selection in the Expansion Draft, {{as well as the}} 1970 NHL Amateur Draft; the Sabres won both spins. With his first selection in the Expansion Draft, Canucks General Manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak. Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach, who was named the Canucks' first captain, as well as defenceman Pat Quinn, who later became the team's general manager and coach in the 1990s. Two days later, on June 11, 1970, the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first-ever Amateur Draft selection. Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks. By comparison, the Sabres chose centre Gilbert Perreault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery; Perreault {{went on to become a}} nine-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
