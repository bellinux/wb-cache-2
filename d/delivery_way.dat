40|$|Background: Rates of {{caesarean}} section are progressively increasing {{in many parts}} of the world. As a result of psychosocial factors, there has been an increasing tendency for pregnant women without justifiable medical indications for {{caesarean section}} to ask for this procedure in China. The psychosocial factors for requesting cesarean section were analyzed in our study. Methods: A self-made questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were administered to evaluate lying-in women’s psychosocial state. Results: The proportion of lying-on women’s age and education degree was different significantly between the two groups (p ％ vs. 3. 42 %, p 0. 05). By logistic regression, we found that for primipara, higher education degree, anxiety and lacking confidence were the dangerous factors for cesarean, while lower economic degree was a defendant factor. Conclusion: There were five main psychosocial factors such as education degree and economic state, parity, anxiety and confidence of lying-on women affecting the choice of the <b>delivery</b> <b>way.</b> The nulliparous women who feel anxious without confidence in nice economic state, with better education have higher risk to choose cesarean. </span...|$|E
40|$|Naturally, {{each company}} intends to {{increase}} its services quality, {{which is one of}} the most important ways to differentiate themselves from competitors. In services field, the definition of quality concept is a very difficult task, in comparison with the production of material goods because in the production of material goods we have rigorous available parameters, measurable, quantifiable, in order to express and evaluate the level of quality that can not be adapted to the measure quality services. Besides the price, the quality is the second element that provides competitive services.

40|$|Background: Inflammatory {{demyelinating disease}} of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) is an {{inflammatory}} disease characterized by a high childbearing female predominance. Labor-related alterations for postpartum demyelinating attacks are not entirely clear. This study aimed to summarize clinical features of female patients of reproductive age with initial CNS inflammatory demyelinating attacks during puerperium. Methods: Fourteen female patients with initial demyelinating events during puerperium between January 2013 and December 2016 were retrospectively studied. Records of clinical features, neuroimaging, serum antibodies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and treatment were analyzed. Results: Among 14 patients, 5 patients were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), four as neuromyelitis optica (NMO), two as longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis, two as clinical isolated syndrome (CIS), and one as acute brainstem syndrome. All the 14 puerperal female patients presented {{with more than one}} manifestation of hemiplegia, paraplegia, uroschesis, visual loss or dysarthria, and with mild to moderate abnormalities of CSF. Attacks occurred during the first trimester postpartum and cesarean section was the main <b>delivery</b> <b>way</b> (n = 10). Median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were 5. 0 (range: 2. 0 – 9. 0) at the onset and 2. 5 (range: 0 – 7. 0) at the end of follow-ups. Patients with MS and CIS had a significantly lower EDSS scores than patients with NMO spectrum disorders (P < 0. 05). Median ARR was 0. 46 (range: 0 – 1. 16); all patients had a low ARR (0. 49 ± 0. 34, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 29 – 0. 69) with standardized treatments.

40|$|Background and Design: Stria gravidarum is a cosmetically disfiguring {{condition}} that is commonly seen in pregnancy. Various parameters {{such as age}} of mother, genetical factors like family history, skin colour, various hormonal changes seen in pregnancy, weight gain and physical features of newborn are accused in the development. The studies reported primarily include primigravidas. In this study, the presence of stria gravidarum and associated risk factors are aimed to be investigated. Materials and methods: All attenders' gestastional week, prepregnancy and delivery weights, height, family history of stria, smoking habits and/or alcohol use during pregnancy, any use of cream and/or oil for preventing stria, <b>delivery</b> <b>way,</b> newborn's gender, height, weight and head circumference were recorded. In both primigravidas and multigravidas, factors that could be associated with stria gravidarum were investigated by Spearman'scorrelation analysis and risk factors {{in the development of}} stria gravidarum by logistic regression analysis. Results: Fifty of 128 pregnant women were primigravidas and 78 were multigravidas. In primigravidas, a correlation was detected between family history of stria, non-usage of cream and/or oil during pregnancy,head circumference of newborn and development of stria gravidarum while in multigravidas, a correlation is detected between prepregnancy weight, delivery weight, smoking during pregnancy, not using of any cream and/or oil during pregnancy, family history of stria, head circumference of newborn, weight of newborn and stria gravidarum development. Presence of family history of stria and not using of any cream and/or oil were found to be risk factors in development of stria gravidarum in all pregnant women by logistic regression analysis.

40|$|Central and {{peripheral}} venous catheters as {{risk factors}} for bloodstream infections in very low birth weight infants Background: Very low birth weight infants (VLBW) have several risk factors relating to their immaturity and a depression of immune system. One {{of the most important}} complications is the nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI). In comparison to adults, central (CVC) and especially peripheral venous catheters (PVC) are not well described as {{risk factors for}} BSI in VLBW. Objective: To describe the relationship between the use of CVC or PVC as a risk of BSIs in VLBW. Method: This analysis was performed within the neonatal component of the German national nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS) which was established in 2000 and includes only patients, who were admitted to a participating neonatal department, had a birth weight (BW) below 1500 g and a complete daily record of patient information. The following items were recorded: department, age at admission, birth weight, gestational age (GA), gender, multiple <b>delivery,</b> <b>way</b> of delivery, days until end of surveillance (discharge/death/reaching a weight of 1800 g), CVC/PVC-days, days with intubation or CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), days of antibiotic therapy {{and the development of a}} nosocomial BSI (diagnosis based on modified CDC definitions). Only surviving patients were included in the analysis. Cox regression models were used to determine the risk factors for the occurrence of nosocomial BSI. Results: A total of 1908 neonates from 22 neonatal departments were included. The median BW of all neonates was 1102 g, the median GA 28 weeks. The median length of stay until the end of surveillance were 43 days. The average duration of CVC use was 9. 2 days and 10. 9 days for the PVC use. 309 (74. 1 %) of the total 417 nosocomial BSI were device (PVC or CVC) associated, the total catheter associated BSI rate was 10. 0 per 1000 catheter days (11. 4 CVC-ass. BSI/ 1000 CVC-days, 8. 7 PVC-ass. BSI/ 1000 PVC-days). On average the first BSI occurred on the 13 th day. The multivariate analysis identified the following independent risk factors for BSI: CVC was used within 2 days before developing BSI (odds ratio (OR) 3. 9), PVC was used within 2 days before developing BSI (OR 3. 7), lower BW categories compared to BW 1250 - 1499 g (BW < 500 g (OR 2. 58), BW 500 - 749 g (OR 2. 48), BW 750 - 999 g (OR 2. 07), BW 1000 - 1249 g (OR 1. 55)), GA below 26 weeks (OR 1. 34). Also the individual departments showed significant differences in the BSI risk (OR from 0. 16 to 10. 65 for individual departments compared to a reference department). Conclusion: Also after adjusting to BW, GA and the individual department this study showed that PVC as well as CVC were significant risk factors for nosocomial BSI in VLBW with narrow difference between the devices. Within the context of a surveillance system for VLBW infants it seems to be valuable to include also the device PVC as a risk factor for BSI...|$|E

40|$|To help meet {{competitive}} realities operations managers need to {{know more}} about the strategic aspects of manufacturing flexibility. This paper takes steps toward meeting that need by critically reviewing the literature and establishing a research agenda for the area. A conceptual model, which places flexibility within a broad context, helps to identify certain assumptions of theoretical studies which need to be challenged. The model also provides a basis for identifying specific flexibility dimensions. The manner in which these dimensions may limit the effectiveness of a manufacturing process, and the problems in operationalizing them are discussed. Focusing next on the neglected area of applied work, concepts are presented for analyzing whether desired amounts of flexibility are being achieved and whether the potential for flexibility built into a manufacturing process is being tapped. Once more, a procedure is outlined for altering a plant's types and amounts of flexibility over time. The research agenda, which grows out of the appraisal of theoretical and applied work, indicates the value in studying generic flexibility strategies, the flexibility dimensions, methods of <b>delivery,</b> <b>ways</b> of evaluating and changing a process's flexibility, and above all measurement problems. The conclusions indicate principles for strategic research, some of which have relevance for the development of mathematical models. manufacturing flexibility, manufacturing strategy, environmental uncertainty, performance measurement, focused factory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the successful biological production and secretion of thioether-stabilized therapeutic peptides. The lantibiotic modification- and transport enzymes NisBTC and LtnM 2 T {{involved in the}} synthesis of the lantibiotics nisin and lacticin 3147, respectively, were exploited for the introduction of thioether bridges in nonlantibiotic peptides. Importantly, thioether peptides produced via lantibiotic enzymes contain only one isomer (DL), whereas chemically induced thioether formation can lead to several stereo isomers (i. e. DL, LL, LD and DD). Exploiting the nisin modification enzymes NisB and NisC, {{we were able to}} demonstrate {{for the first time the}} posttranslational introduction of a thioether bridge in a therapeutic peptide, an analog of angiotensin-(1 - 7). This therapeutic peptide variant has a significantly improved stability and the effectivity of its interaction with the angiotensin-(1 - 7) receptor is even enhanced. This cyclized analog of angiotensin-(1 - 7) is therefore a promising therapeutic peptide candidate for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, other therapeutic peptides may be thioether-stabilized, using lantibiotic synthesis enzymes. By stabilization, these therapeutic peptides are less sensitive to proteolytic breakdown and accordingly need less frequent administration and/or in a lower dose. In addition, stabilization may allow oral and pulmonary <b>delivery.</b> These <b>delivery</b> <b>ways</b> are more patient-friendly than injection. While there are hundreds of medically highly important therapeutic peptides, the pharmaceutical market of already a single therapeutic peptide can have a size of over a billion dollar.

40|$|Objectives of {{this study}} were 1) to {{investigate}} the mineral intake by Chinese lactating women, 2) to explore the dietary source of minerals, and 3) the ratios between different dietary minerals. A total of 468 lactating women in 5 - 240 days post-partum participated in this study. Food intakes by participants were measured using one time of 24 -hour dietary recall, and minerals from food were calculated based on the Chinese Food Composition Table, second edition. In post-partum, women had inadequate food intake. 81. 0 % of women's daily intake of dairy products was lower than 300 g, and 97. 1 % of women's daily intake of salt over 6 g. For mineral intake, there were 81. 8 %, 59. 0 %, 47. 6 %, 45. 7 % and 66. 8 % of women's calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc and selenium intake lower than the estimated average requirement, respectively, and 91. 7 % of women's excessive intake of sodium. The calcium/phosphorus and sodium/potassium ratios were 0. 41 ± 0. 26 / 1 and 3. 13 ± 2. 89 / 1, respectively. Considering the dietary sources of minerals, 27. 3 %, 25. 3 % and 30. 1 % of iron, zinc and calcium were from animal-based food, respectively, and 60. 3 %, 66. 1 % and 58. 0 % of iron, zinc and calcium were from plant-based food, respectively. The phosphorus-protein ratio was 0. 014 ± 0. 003 / 1. Lactation stage was associated with nutrient intake.

This paper firstly acknowledges narrative as a structural model for understanding and defining teaching & learning. It then proposes the narrative structure of Soap Opera as being {{in tune with the}} way Millennial learners (under 23 years of age) comprehend time and space. The feminised narrative structure of the Soap Opera provides a framework for considering an alternative mode of <b>delivery</b> and <b>way</b> of organising instruction. Soap Operas provide answers to the question of youth engagement in education by developing shorter and more intensive bursts of training...|$|R

Test sponsors {{are concerned about the}} policy issues related to test use; test developers must prepare a test that meets both the purpose and specifications articulated by the test sponsor and the technical standards for quality tests. Test administrators are responsible for test <b>delivery</b> in <b>ways</b> that protect the integrity of the test scores and the security of the test product. Test takers often have limited options in when, how, or why they are taking the test, and may feel victimized in the process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on the test taker and to consider how all parties in the test process (test sponsor, test developer, test administrator, and test taker) have a role to play in ensuring fair testing practices and valid test results...|$|R
40|$|From {{the view}} of value chain, the article {{analyzes}} the forming mechanism of logistics value chain, {{and the value of}} the various aspects of the express <b>delivery.</b> By that <b>way,</b> express enterprises can identify the value-added parts from the whole process of mails or goods from senders to receivers, and all these parts will lead to logistics value added. Based on value chain analysis, a model of logistics competitiveness is established. The model includes four aspects: location, network optimization / integration, value-added services / response and performance measures, which form the core competitiveness for express enterprises...|$|R

This {{research}} {{considers the}} way banks have altered their strategies as regulatory change (i. e. deregulation) {{and information technology}} (IT) innovations created more opportunities for service delivery and extended the range of potential competitors and forms of competition. These external changes provided new diversification and growth opportunities but also modified prior expectations about the way managers defined and controlled their bank’s core capabilities in pursuing current and potential business. The main research instrument used was a one hour, semi-structured interview; and in total 55 managers of commercial banks, investment banks, management consulting firms and regulators from Mexico, Spain and the UK participated. Qualitative and quantitative analysis established that {{the great majority of}} banks responded to changes in growth opportunities through diversification moves but with no clear link to core capabilities. IT management played a secondary role in the design of bank strategy but at the same time, IT applications were perceived as an important force to modify competition in bank markets by supporting radical re-engineering of service <b>delivery</b> in <b>ways</b> that undermined previous advantages of scale and scope...|$|R
