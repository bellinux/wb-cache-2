The PLC Council nearly kept the school at Strathfield permanently, but ultimately {{it was decided that}} PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first term 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, and the Lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school. Evidence of PLC's wartime occupation remain, with tunnels and bomb shelters accessible from below the stage of College Hall.

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment.

After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City {{began their}} {{campaign}} for the 1926–27 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against Aston Villa.

Aston Villa attempted to save the match, but were unable to score until goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff played Darlington away. Newspaper reports <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the better team, but {{had it not been}} for the success of Darlington's defence then they would have won by greater than the two goal margin they achieved.
