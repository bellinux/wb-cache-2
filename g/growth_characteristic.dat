Stathmin (aka op18) can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation when mutated and not functioning properly. If stathmin is unable to bind to tubulin, it allows for constant microtubule assembly and therefore constant mitotic spindle assembly. With no {{regulation of the}} mitotic spindle, the cell cycle is capable of cycling uncontrollably resulting in the unregulated cell <b>growth</b> <b>characteristic</b> of cancer cells.|$|E

Broad-sense heritability and {{correlations between the}} measured characteristics were also determined. Significant differences for all measured characteristics were observed among provenances, indicating that these characteristics are genetically controlled. Broad-sense heritabilities of <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics,</b> SWV, and P are moderate values. These results indicate potential for improving <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> and wood properties of teak trees {{with the help of}} breeding programs. Highly significant positive correlations were observed among the <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics,</b> suggesting that they are closely related. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between the <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> and SWV, indicating that they are independent. We conclude that mechanical properties are also important criteria for selecting plus trees in tree breeding programs.

In the present study, <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> [stem diameter (D), tree height (H), and bole volume (V)], stress-wave velocity (SWV), and Pilodyn penetration (Py) were measured for 15 clones of 12 -year-old teak trees planted at two different sites in Indonesia to clarify the variations in tree <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics,</b> SWV, and Py among clones, their repeatability, interaction between genotype and environment, and correlations between measured characteristics. Significant differences of all measured characteristics were found among 15 clones at both sites. Their repeatability showed relatively moderate to high values in both sites. These results indicate that these characteristics are closely related to genetic factors. Significant interaction between genotype and environment was found in all measured characteristics. In addition, SWV and Py showed lower interaction between genotype and environment than <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics.</b> No significant correlation was found between <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> and SWV.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the essential reasons of this issue in theoretical and empirical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops the model of derived demand for petroleum in agro-production; analyzes the effect on agricultural labor-machinery due to the changes in relative price of input factors; and reveals the reasons for the rigid growth of the demand for farm diesel; as well as estimates the substitution of agricultural machine for labor. Findings – The results indicate that the rigid <b>growth</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the demand for farm diesel is due to the adjustment of the product and factor markets; and the most important reason is the changes in structure of the agro-production inputs caused by the relative soaring price of agricultural labor-machinery. Practical implications – The government should attach importance to its impact on farmers and take effective measures to insure the stable development of agricultural production.

The silver halide crystallites (~ 100 Å in size) were obtained as a separated phase in a photochromic glass. Using the frequency-doubled output of a Q-switched ruby laser for optical excitation, time-resolved transmission spectra were obtained with a vidicon spectrometer as well as by monochromatic measurements at various wavelengths.

The extent to which fetal <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> track in different trimesters is not known. Methods: In a population-based prospective cohort study among 8636 pregnant women, we examined {{the extent to which}} fetal <b>growth</b> <b>characteristics</b> track, are influenced by maternal socio-demographic and lifestyle related determinants and are associated with birth outcomes. Fetal growth was assessed in each trimester and at birth. Results: Correlation coefficient between first-trimester crown-rump length and birthweight was r= 0. 12 (P-value< 0. 05). Correlation coefficients for fetal-head circumference, (femur) length and (estimated) fetal weight ranged from r= 0. 16 to r= 0. 30 (all P-values< 0. 05) between second trimester and birth and from r= 0. 36 to r= 0. 58 (all P-values< 0. 05) between third trimester and birth, and were highest for (estimated) fetal weight. Correlation coefficients for (estimated) fetal weight tended to be lower among overweight mothers, as compared with normal weight mothers, but were not influenced by other maternal characteristics.
