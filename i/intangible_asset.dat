5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from the financial aid from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E

In the 2005 financial year, which cover the first Serie A season, the club made a net loss of €9,159,356, followed by a net loss of €19,519,789. In 2006 (2005–06 Serie A and 2006–07 Serie A), Fiorentina heavily invested on players, meaning the amortisation of <b>intangible</b> <b>asset</b> (the player contract) had increased from €17.7million to €24million. However the club suffered from the 2006 Italian football scandal, which meant the club did not qualify for Europe. In 2007 Fiorentina almost broke-even, with a net loss of just €3,704,953. In the 2007 financial year the TV revenue increased after they qualified to the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Despite qualifying to the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, Fiorentina made a net loss of €9,179,484 in 2008 financial year after the increase in TV revenue was outweighed by the increase in wage. In the 2009 financial year, Fiorentina made a net profit of €4,442,803, largely due to the profit on selling players (€33,631,489 from players such as Felipe Melo, Giampaolo Pazzini and Zdravko Kuzmanović; increased from about €3.5million in 2008). However it was also offset by the write-down of selling players (€6,062,545, from players such as Manuel da Costa, Arturo Lupoli and Davide Carcuro).|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor related to intangible investments, this study analyzes factors related to intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are related to intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance.

Third, <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited.

Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively related to <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> and statistically insignificant.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} firms’ total {{underlying}} <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> {{and the proportion}} of capitalized <b>intangibles</b> <b>assets</b> are related to analyst forecast errors, using a sample of listed firms using IFRS on the European stock markets. Previous research has shown that firms with high levels of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are more difficult for analysts to forecast correctly due to the uncertainty and complexity of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Furthermore, earlier research also show that capitalization of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> lead to lower analyst forecast errors. This study is conducted on the European market between the years 2005 - 2015, examining all listed firms in Europe with available forecast data, resulting in a final sample of 20 285 firm-years. Data was collected from the Bloomberg database and the results show patterns similar to the ones found in previous research on the subject. We find that analyst earnings forecast errors are positively associated with firms’ levels of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> and negatively associated with the proportion of capitalized <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> over total underlying <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> We also find that the latter association is more negative for firms with high levels of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> compared to firms with no or low levels of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Thus, the results suggest that <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> complicate the earnings forecasting task for analysts, and we find evidence that strongly suggest that capitalization of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> provides analysts with valuable information that increases the accuracy of their earnings forecasts.

This provides insights into the nature of the information provided by <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> and identifies a basis for the association between stock prices and identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> This leads to the conclusion that identifiable <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> disclosures are value relevant, and that with the application of the restrictive recognition rules in AASB 138 these disclosures in financial reports will be greatly diminished.

40|$|Background and Problem Discussion: <b>Intangible</b> <b>assets</b> {{are getting}} more and more {{important}} to companies and their owners. The {{reason for this is that}} the economy has changed from being industrial to knowledge-based. It is no longer the industrial value chain that creates value, it is innovation and constantly seeking new ways of meeting market demands. Companies can no longer differentiate themselves or create competitive advantages without <b>intangible</b> <b>assets.</b> With increased importance of values in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> the need for financial information about companies has changed. However, current accounting systems have not been able to keep up with this development. Because of the uncertainty connected with <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> accounting cannot capture their increasingly important value. Consequently, investors and other users of financial information are not provided with sufficient information to make good decisions. This poses the question whether relevance has been lost in accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets?</b> Further, because of this possible lost of relevance, perhaps alternative approaches on reporting of <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are needed? Purpose: The main purpose of this essay is to discuss whether relevance in accounting for increasingly important <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> has been lost. Method: To be able to discuss whether relevance in accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> has been lost, we have laid a foundation consisting of existing regulations of accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets,</b> as well as literature and articles on the subject. Further, we have examined the accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in two Swedish groups, AstraZeneca and the Volvo Group, in order to get a more practical view on the subject. The investigation of the two groups has been made by contducting interviews and studying their financial reports. Delimitations: The discussion of this essay will be delimited to the accounting for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> in big Swedish groups listed on the stock market. Consistently, the discussion will be based on the accounting regulations for <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> applied in these groups, namely IAS 38 – <b>Intangible</b> <b>assets</b> and IFRS 3 – Business Combinations. Results and Conclusions: The lack in current accounting systems lies in the fact that it cannot capture all important intangible values. This results in traditional incomes statements and balance sheets being misleading to investors and other users of financial information. Further, because great values in <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> are kept hidden in today’s accounting, investors are compelled to make difficult assessments about these values in order to make their decisions. However, we do not find the solution in taking all <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> into the balance sheet at any cost. The important qualities of today’s accounting, such as reliability, cannot be jeopardized. Information about hidden <b>intangible</b> <b>assets</b> would therefore be better provided through some kind of alternative reporting. However, this kind of reporting has its errors in possibly being too subjective...|$|R
