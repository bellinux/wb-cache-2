50|$|The {{creature}} {{exits the}} vents and kills two crewmen. As Kirk, McCoy and Spock discuss {{how to respond}} to this invasion, Spock explains that he now concurs with Kirk's concern about the creature: it displayed the intelligence to recognize an attack, to retaliate effectively, and is obviously aggressive. Kirk orders Scotty to close all vents and flood the system with radioactive waste to see it can affect the creature. Afterwards, Spock privately attempts to reassure Kirk that, since the creature cannot be harmed with conventional weapons, the captain has nothing to regret about his earlier encounter on the Farragut - firing immediately back then would have made no difference. Kirk, however, tacitly rebuffs Spock, claiming his concern is only {{for the safety of the}} ship and the crew. However, when Spock visits Ensign Garrovick about the matter, the gaseous creature enters through the ventilation system. Spock orders the Ensign out and attempts to stop the creature. Fortunately for Spock, the creature gets a taste of Spock's Vulcan blood, which repels it due to its alien copper-based composition. The creature lets Spock go and flees the ship. Kirk, realizing that neither he nor Ensign Garrovick could have harmed the creature, allows the <b>ensign</b> to <b>return</b> to duty.|$|R

40|$|A {{major goal}} of some tax reform proponents is the {{elimination}} of the return filing requirement for many or all Americans. Although the President 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform heard several hours of testimony concerning the possibility of a 2 ̆ 2 return-free 2 ̆ 2 income tax system, the Report of the Panel failed even to discuss the issue. This Article contends that the Panel was right to recommend (by implication) the retention of a return-based tax system, given the Panel 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations for major tax simplification. As long as the <b>return</b> filing <b>obligation</b> is not unduly burdensome which it would not be under the Panel 2 ̆ 7 s simplification proposals a filing obligation has significant civic virtues. A return-based system represents an appropriate compromise on the level of visibility and painfulness of taxation, and the filing of an tax return can serve an important ceremonial function as an expression of fiscal citizenship. The civic potential of return filing is not now realized because of the tremendous complexity of the income tax, but that potential could be realized under a simplified system...|$|R
