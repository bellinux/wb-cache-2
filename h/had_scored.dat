5|$|Brown was rested for {{the next}} match against Surrey, which Australia won by an innings. After the first four matches, five Australians hade made centuries, and another had passed fifty. Brown <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> only 66 runs with a highest score of 26, while Morris and Barnes, the {{incumbent}} openers, <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 223 and 298 runs with a century and fifty apiece.|$|E
5|$|Loxton <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 203 runs {{in three}} innings {{at an average}} of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> a century in the {{previous}} Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team was exactly the same as for the opening fixture against Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|Steinitz's long lay-off {{caused some}} {{commentators}} {{to suggest that}} Zukertort, who <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> some notable tournament victories, {{should be regarded as}} the world chess champion.|$|E

5|$|Another final appearance, {{the third}} of Messi's senior {{international}} career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone. In his 100 appearances, he <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.|$|E
5|$|By 6 April 1917, Voss <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 24 {{victories}} and awarded Germany's highest award, the Pour le Mérite. The medal's mandatory month's leave removed Voss {{from the battlefield}} during Bloody April; in his absence, Richthofen scored 13 victories. Nevertheless, Richthofen regarded Voss as his only possible rival as top scoring ace of the war.|$|E

5|$|Macartney {{then made}} 106 in a non-first-class match against the West of Scotland, before hitting 109 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in a rain-affected draw; the match {{failed to reach}} the second innings. Macartney <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> three centuries in as many innings.|$|E
25|$|Warne also <b>has</b> <b>scored</b> {{the most}} {{international}} runs without scoring any centuries (4172 runs) {{and also the}} first batsman to <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> 4000+ runs international level without a career hundred.|$|R

5|$|Milan {{were drawn}} against German team Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. The first leg at the San Siro {{ended in a}} 2–2 draw after Bayern <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> an {{equaliser}} three minutes into stoppage time. The second leg at Bayern's home ground the Allianz Arena was more comfortable for Milan, as they scored two first half goals to win the match 2–0 and win the tie 4–2 on aggregate. Milan were drawn against English team Manchester United in the semi-finals. The first leg at United's home ground Old Trafford, Kaka scored twice to give Milan a 2–1 lead after Cristiano Ronaldo <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> an early goal.

5|$|Note: Only the {{top five}} {{positions}} are included for the Drivers' standings. Only top two included for the Constructors' standings as only two teams <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> points. Benetton and Williams did not receive Constructors' points at this race.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> {{the decisive}} penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} {{down the middle of}} the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E

50|$|Kalengo is {{the leading}} scorer in ties between Zesco United and Zanaco. He <b>has</b> <b>scored</b> 12 times in these ties with 6 goals for each team.

5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford on 8 July for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 73 runs at 24.33 {{in three}} innings; he {{was replaced by}} the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had made 47 not out against Surrey and an unbeaten 159 against Gloucestershire. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Brown <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 800 runs on tour at {{an average}} of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those {{positions}} regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines. There was a chance one of them would receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E

25|$|The {{team that}} <b>has</b> <b>scored</b> more goals {{at the end}} of the game is the winner. If both teams <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a draw.|$|R
50|$|Berrington is {{the only}} Scot to <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> centuries in both the One Day International and Twenty20 International formats. He {{was also the first}} player from an Associate nation to <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> a Twenty20 International century.|$|R
5|$|Up to this point, {{the reserve}} opener Brown <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out, and was on his third tour of England. In contrast, Harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29 despite his unbeaten 100 against Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{had good}} {{starting}} field position {{at their own}} 44-yard line. One quick first down later, the clock ran out on the thirdquarter. As neither team <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> in the quarter, the score remained tied at 1616.|$|E
5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting <b>had</b> <b>scored</b> 140 not out (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.|$|E
50|$|The game is five up. By agreement, {{the game}} may count a treble if the adversary has not scored; a double if he <b>has</b> <b>scored</b> one or two; a single if he <b>has</b> <b>scored</b> three or four.|$|R
