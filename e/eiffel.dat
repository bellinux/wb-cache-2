5|$|With {{the opening}} of the École supérieure d'aéronautique et de constructions mécaniques on 15 November 1909, Coandă moved to Paris. As a {{continuation}} of his Belgian experiments, and especially {{looking for a way to}} test wing aerofoils at higher speeds, he contacted Ernest Archdeacon, the co-founder of L'Aero-Club de France, who in turn directed Coandă to Gustav <b>Eiffel</b> and Paul Painlevé. With their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by <b>Eiffel</b> at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway. In March, he started flying lessons at Reims in a Hanriot monoplane.|$|E

She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her previous work in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, she felt that she had to be extra careful.|$|E

The lift hill structure for Intimidator 305 is unique in that the lift hill and crest only have two main points of support. The overall height of Intimidator 305 {{is higher than the}} observation platform of the park's <b>Eiffel</b> Tower replica, {{making it one of the}} tallest rides at Kings Dominion.|$|E
50|$|Little {{progress}} was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration {{to the terms of}} the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of <b>Eiffel's</b> design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine <b>Eiffel's</b> scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except <b>Eiffel's</b> were either impractical or lacking in details.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Eiffel's</b> [...] "agent" [...] {{mechanism}} wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be {{used for}} iteration, event-driven programming, and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize functional programming, allow a similar pattern using continuations, closures, or generators; <b>Eiffel's</b> agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in Smalltalk and Ruby.|$|R

5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital <b>Eiffel</b> Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
5|$|After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness {{retrieve}} the warheads {{and take them}} to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|As a {{newspaper}} columnist, Prus {{commented on the}} achievements of scholars and scientists such as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and Henry Thomas Buckle; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce; encouraged the establishment of charitable institutions to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as H.G. Wells; and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the Wieliczka Salt Mine, an 1887 solar eclipse that he witnessed at Mława, planned building of the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower for the 1889 Paris Exposition, and Nałęczów, where he vacationed for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Bastille Day, {{a celebration}} of the {{storming}} of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower.|$|E
5|$|Bond visits Ascot Racecourse {{to observe}} the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, {{believes}} that Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes after being chased by Bond.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, while {{posted in}} Paris as Peruvian air attaché, Bielovucic {{actively}} {{cooperated with the}} French Resistance. At the age of 57, he parachuted from the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower. Bielovucic died in Paris on 14 January 1949 and was buried at the Cimetiere nouveau de Neuilly in the Nanterre commune of Paris. His biography was written by Lieutenant General José Zlatar Stambuk of the Peruvian Air Force and published in 1990. In Croatia, he {{is regarded as the}} first Croatian aviator because of his paternal ethnic origin. He is known as Ivan Bjelovučić there, while most sources refer to him as Jean Bielovucic or Juan Bielovucic Cavalié.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{his work}} was done for Gustave <b>Eiffel's</b> [...] "Compagnie des établissements Eiffel", which Koechlin joined in 1879. In 1886 Maurice married Emma Rossier (1867-1965). They had six children: three sons and three daughters. Maurice and Emma were lifelong members of the Plymouth Brethren.|$|R
50|$|The Aéro-Torpille No.1 created great {{interest}} during the 1911 Salon de l’Aéronautique at the Grand Palais in Paris {{due to its}} novel design and streamlined appearance. Great care had been taken in the design to eliminate drag, and the design had been tested on Gustave <b>Eiffel's</b> wind tunnel.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, CVNE {{refurbished}} the old winery buildings {{dating back}} to the 19th century, and created an educational area called “La Aldea del Vino” (The Wine Village), in which {{one of the very few}} remaining examples of Gustav <b>Eiffel’s</b> engineering techniques to avoid using pillars in wide buildings can be seen.|$|R
5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|Kalki Koechlin {{was born}} in Pondicherry, India, on 10 January 1984 to French parents, Joel Koechlin and Françoise Armandie, who came to India from Angers, France. She is a {{descendant}} of Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer who {{played an important role}} in the design and construction of the <b>Eiffel</b> Tower. Koechlin's parents are devotees of Sri Aurobindo. The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, where Koechlin's father established a business designing hang-gliders and ultralight aircraft.|$|E
