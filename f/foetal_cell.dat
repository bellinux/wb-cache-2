The subsequent outgrowth of virus-transformed <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> was markedly inhibited by the presence in the cultures of IM-derived T cells, whilst similar numbers of T cells prepared either from cord blood or from adult donors seronegative for EB virus had little or no inhibitory effect. Target <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> treated with papain to remove any viral envelope material remaining on the cell surface after infection, were just as sensitive as untreated cells to the addition of IM-derived T cells. It is concluded that the inhibition cannot be mediated through recognition either of viral envelope structures on the surface of infected cells or of the antigenically related virus-determined membrane antigen, MA, but must depend upon recognition of the lymphocyte-detected membrane antigen, LYDMA. The regularity with which IM-derived T cells block the outgrowth of virus-transformed <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> suggests that LYDMA consistently appears on the surface of infected <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> before the establishment of transformed foci, but is unlikely to be directly associated with the cells' existing histocompatibility antigens...|$|R

However, {{there is a great}} need for {{research}} into this topic, due to the prevalence of central nervous system disorders and the devastating impact they have on people’s lives. A number of strategies are being examined to achieve this goal, including cell replacement therapy, enhancement of endogenous plasticity and the recruitment of endogenous neurogenesis. The current chapter reviews this topic within the context of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and stroke. For each disease exogenous cell therapies are discussed including primary (<b>foetal)</b> <b>cell</b> transplants, neural stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and marrow stromal cells. This chapter highlights the different mechanistic approaches of cell replacement therapy versus cells that deliver neurotropic factors, or enhance the endogenous production of these factors. Evidence of exogenously transplanted cells functionally integrating into the host brain, replacing cells, and having a behavioural benefit are discussed, along with the ability of some cell sources to stimulate endogenous neuroprotective and restorative events.

40|$|AbstractThyroid cancers are {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} malignancy. Radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer and some inherited conditions {{are the most}} important predisposing factors for the development of thyroid cancer. Three mitogenic signalling pathways have been described in the thyroid cell, which are influenced by various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. Various proto-oncogenes and oncogenes like ras, braf, trk, met and RET also {{play a role in the}} signal transduction systems. Two theories have been described in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, the <b>foetal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinogenesis theory and the more common, multistep carcinogenesis theory. The multistep carcinogenesis theory is now the accepted model in many human cancers, including thyroid cancer. The early events of tumour formation are the consequence of activation of either various growth factors or the proto-oncogenes like ras, met or ret. This results in the formation of differentiated thyroid cancers like the papillary, follicular or Hurthle cell cancers. The later stages of tumour formation involve further activation of proto-oncogenes and loss or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes like p 53. Based on this theory, follicular carcinomas are generated from follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas from precursor cells generated from thyrocytes. Anaplastic carcinoma may develop from papillary or follicular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. In this review article, we highlight the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumours...|$|E

40|$|<b>Foetal</b> <b>cell</b> {{transplantation}} {{in patients}} with Parkinson’s disease can induce motor complications independent of l-DOPA administration, known as graft-induced dyskinesia. In the 6 -OHDA lesioned rat model of Parkinson’s disease, post-transplantation abnormal movements can develop {{in response to an}} amphetamine challenge, a behaviour which is used to model graft-induced dyskinesia. Although l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia has been well characterised pharmacologically, we lack knowledge on the modulation of post-transplantation amphetamine-induced dyskinesia which may shed light on the mechanisms underlying graft-induced dyskinesia. We assessed a series of drugs effective at reducing l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia against post-transplantation amphetamine-induced dyskinesia. Agents include: dopaminergic antagonists (D 1 : CP 94253; D 2 : SCH- 22390; D 3 : nafadotride), serotonergic agonists (5 -HT 1 A: 8 -OH-DPAT; 5 -HT 1 B: CP 94253), opioid antagonist (μ: naloxone), cannabinoid agonist (CB 1 : WIN 55, 212 - 2), adrenergic antagonist (α 1 and α 2 : yohimbine) and glutamatergic antagonists (NMDA: amantadine and MK- 801; mGluR 5 : MTEP; AMPA: IEM 1460). Abnormal involuntary movements in response to amphetamine were decreased by SCH- 22390, raclopride, CP 94253 and 8 -OH-DPAT, yet were unaltered by naloxone, WIN 55, 212 - 2, yohimbine, amantadine, MTEP and IEM 1460.

40|$|There is a {{molecular}} crosstalk between the trophoblast and maternal immune cells of bovine endometrium. The uterine cells {{are able to}} secrete cytokine/chemokines to either induce a suppressive environment for establishment of the pregnancy or to recruit immune cells to the endometrium to fight infections. Despite morphological differences between women and cows, mechanisms for immune tolerance during pregnancy seem to be conserved. Mechanisms for uterine immunesuppression in the cow include: reduced expression of major histocompatability proteins by the trophoblast; recruitment of macrophages to the pregnant endometrium; and modulation of immune-related genes {{in response to the}} presence of the conceptus. Recently, an eGFP transgenic cloned embryo model developed by our group showed that there is modulation of foetal proteins expressed at the site of syncytium formation, suggesting that <b>foetal</b> <b>cell</b> can regulate not only by the secretion of specific factors such as interferon-tau, but also by regulating their own protein expression to avoid excessive maternal recognition by the local immune system. Furthermore, foetal DNA can be detected in the maternal circulation; this may reflect the occurrence of an invasion of trophoblast cells and/or their fragment beyond the uterine basement membrane in the cow. In fact, the newly description of exosome release by the trophoblast cell suggests that could be a new fashion of maternal-foetal communication at the placental barrier. Additionally, recent global transcriptome studies on bovine endometrium suggested that the immune system is aware, from an immunological point of view, of the presence of the foetus in the cow during early pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Foetal {{midbrain}} progenitors {{have been}} shown to survive, give rise to different classes of dopamine neurons and integrate into the host brain alleviating Parkinsonian symptoms following transplantation in patients and animal models of the disease. Dopamine neuron subpopulations in the midbrain, namely A 9 and A 10, can be identified anatomically based on cell morphology and ascending axonal projections. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel Girk 2 and the calcium binding protein Calbindin are the two best available histochemical markers currently used to label (with some overlap) A 9 - and A 10 -like dopamine neuron subtypes, respectively, in tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons both in the midbrain and grafts. Both classes of dopamine neurons survive in grafts in the striatum and extend axonal projections to their normal dorsal and ventral striatal targets depending on phenotype. Nevertheless, grafts transplanted into the dorsal striatum, which is an A 9 input nucleus, are enriched for dopamine neurons that express Girk 2. It remains to be elucidated whether different transplantation sites favour the differential survival and/or development of concordant dopamine neuron subtypes within the grafts. Here we used rat foetal midbrain progenitors at two developmental stages corresponding to a peak in either A 9 or A 10 neurogenesis and examined their commitment to respective dopaminergic phenotypes by grafting cells into different forebrain regions that contain targets of either nigral A 9 dopamine innervation (dorsal striatum), ventral tegmental area A 10 dopamine innervation (nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex), or only sparse dopamine but rich noradrenaline innervation (hippocampus). We demonstrate that young (embryonic day, E 12), but not older (E 14),mesencephalic tissue and the transplant environment influence survival and functional integration of specific subtypes of dopamine neurons into the host brain. We also show that irrespective of donor age A 9 -like, Girk 2 -expressing neurons are more responsive to environmental cues in adopting a dopaminergic phenotype during differentiation postgrafting. These novel findings suggest that dopamine progenitors use targets of A 9 /A 10 innervation in the transplantation site to complete maturation and the efficacy of <b>foetal</b> <b>cell</b> replacement therapy in patients may be improved by deriving midbrain tissue at earlier developmental stages than in current practice...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} the components {{for a family}} of computational models of the electrophysiology of the human foetal heart from 60 days gestational age (DGA) to full term. This requires both cell excitation models that re{{construct the}} myocyte action potentials, and datasets of cardiac geometry and architecture. Fast low-angle shot and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) of foetal hearts provides cardiac geometry with voxel resolution of approximately 100 µm. DT-MRI measures the relative diffusion of protons and provides a measure of the average intravoxel myocyte orientation, and the orientation of any higher order orthotropic organization of the tissue. Such orthotropic organization in the adult mammalian heart has been identified with myocardial sheets and cleavage planes between them. During gestation, the architecture of the human ventricular wall changes from being irregular and isotropic at 100 DGA to an anisotropic and orthotropic architecture by 140 DGA, when it has the smooth, approximately 120 ° transmural change in myocyte orientation that is characteristic of the adult mammalian ventricle. The DT obtained from DT-MRI provides the conductivity tensor that determines the spread of potential within computational models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology. The foetal electrocardiogram (fECG) can be recorded from approximately 60 DGA, and RR, PR and QT intervals between the P, R, Q and T waves of the fECG can be extracted by averaging from approximately 90 DGA. The RR intervals provide a measure of the pacemaker rate, the QT intervals an index of ventricular action potential duration, and its rate-dependence, and so these intervals constrain and inform models of cell electrophysiology. The parameters of models of adult human sinostrial node and ventricular cells that are based on adult cell electrophysiology and tissue molecular mapping have been modified to construct preliminary models of <b>foetal</b> <b>cell</b> electrophysiology, which reproduce these intervals from fECG recordings. The PR and QR intervals provide an index of conduction times, and hence propagation velocities (approx. 1 – 10 cm s− 1, increasing during gestation) and so inform models of tissue electrophysiology.

METHODS: Amniotic fluid cells were harvested from three donor does at 23 days of gestation (term = 32 days) and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). In 42 other does, foetal membrane defects were induced by foetoscopic needle puncture at 23 days of gestation, and closed with either a platelet-enriched collagen plug with (n = 44) or without (n = 32) amniotic fluid cells. At 30 days of gestation, the defects were harvested and assessed microscopically. RESULTS: The plugs enriched with heterologous amniotic fluid cells more commonly had proliferating cells in the centre of the plug than those without cell addition. CFDA-SE labelling confirmed the presence of heterologous amniotic fluid cells over the entire membrane plug.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Foetomaternal {{haemorrhage}} (FMH) {{over the}} years has been a matter of a major concern as it occurs asymptomatically {{and is one of the}} most common disorders responsible for foetal death. FMH occurs when there is leakage of foetal blood into maternal circulation due to breach in the physiological barrier between their circulations. In most pregnancies about 0. 1 ml foetal bleed occurs and it could be acute or chronic. The detection and quantification of any quantity of <b>foetal</b> red blood <b>cells</b> in maternal circulation would be important for obstetrical management of pregnant women. But FMH is not part of the routine screening done for pregnant women in many areas. Aims/objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of FMH among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in a District Hospital towards recommending the testing as part of the routine screening of pregnant women. Methods: A Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT) was used to quantify <b>foetal</b> red blood <b>cells</b> in venous blood from 212 expectant mothers recruited for the study. Thin blood smear (film) was prepared, dried, fixed, incubated in an acid solution and stained with eosin. They were then examined under the microscope. The <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> were counted and reported as a percentage of the adult cells and the FMH was calculated from that. Antibody screening was also done using the Coombs indirect test. Results: There was FM...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} isolated hepatocytes from foetal, newborn and adult rats. The GSH/GSSG ratio decreased 15 - 20 -fold through the foetal-neonatal-adult transition. This was mainly {{due to an}} increase in GSSG. All enzyme activities involved in the glutathione redox cycle tend to increase during that transition, but the relative increases in glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase were 3 - 5 times those of glutathione reductase or glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase. GSH synthesis from methionine as a sulphur source was 6 times lower in foetal than in adult hepatocytes. However, when N-acetylcysteine was used as a sulphur donor to by-pass the cystathionine pathway, the rates of GSH synthesis were similar in <b>foetal</b> and adult <b>cells.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that cystathionase activity in <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> is very low. This low activity is reflected in the blood amino acid pattern, where the concentration of cysteine rises from 8 to 52 microM from foetuses to adult rats. This supports the idea that cysteine may be an essential amino acid for the premature animal...|$|R
40|$|Placentae were {{examined}} from 120 women whose pregnancy and delivery was normal, from 264 women whose pregnancy or delivery was complicated, and from 98 {{women who were}} Rh-negative without antibodies and 35 women Rh-negative with antibodies. The presence of Kline's haemorrhages, intervillous thrombi, infarcts, and retroplacental haemorrhages {{was positively correlated with}} the presence of <b>foetal</b> <b>cells</b> in the maternal circulation. When there were no maternal antibodies transplacental haemorrhages occurred occasionally in the absence of such placental lesions but more frequently when these lesions were present. Moreover, the greater the number of lesions in a placenta the greater the size of the transplacental haemorrhage. In Rh-negative women with antibodies the observed incidence of transplacental haemorrhage was significantly less despite an appreciable increase in placental lesions...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{interaction}} in vitro between C. parvum-induced adherent predominantly phagocytic rat peritoneal cells and syngeneic or xenogeneic tumour targets consistently produces marked cytotoxicity. In {{the presence of}} irradiated <b>foetal</b> liver <b>cells,</b> expression of cytotoxicity is blocked in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of liver cells to compete with tumour targets is rapidly lost after birth. Irradiated liver cells from adult donors showed no such competition with tumour cells. The in vivo growth in ascites form of rat fibrosarcoma cells of low immunogenicity is significantly enhanced by irradiated <b>foetal</b> liver <b>cells</b> administered locally shortly before or {{on the day of}} tumour-cell challenge. The findings may provide an indication as {{to the nature of the}} structures recognized as non-self by mononuclear phagocytes...|$|R
