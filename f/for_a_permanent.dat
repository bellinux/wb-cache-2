5|$|COVRA (Centrale Organisatie Voor Radioactief Afval) is the Dutch interim {{nuclear waste}} {{processing}} and storage company in Vlissingen, which stores the waste produced in their only remaining {{nuclear power plant}} after it is reprocessed by Areva NC in La Hague, Manche, Normandy, France.

5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|Following the uprising, {{prominent}} {{figures in}} Scranton began advocating <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> militia, {{and within a}} week nearly a thousand dollars were raised to this effect.

On August 23 a piece ran in The Scranton Republican announcing that the four companies had been formed, and would muster on September 11 for inspection by the governor. In 1878 the Pennsylvania legislature organized the group as the Thirteenth Regiment, Third Brigade, Pennsylvania National Guard. The brigade went on to see action in three other major strikes.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site {{was announced in}} 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E

The ESM is an intergovernmental organisation under public international law. It is located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. The Pilgrims explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims eventually came across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to a site in the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E

5|$|The {{existing}} permanent members, each {{holding the}} right of veto on Security Council reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India, and {{a small number of}} additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan to permanent-member status, as well as more African countries on the Council. China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. Russia has also endorsed India's candidature <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> seat on the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial hostilities, good {{relations}} between the Portuguese and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual Portuguese trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the Portuguese helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa—a later Governor of Macau— established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authorities and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> and official Portuguese trade base at Macau. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade and his Portuguese comrades {{were the first to}} open up China to the West, another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (15521610) ventured there in 1598.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's research activities in Antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base. This gave the advantage that the research was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In 1989, any party to the Treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> residence. Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Permanent</b> Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
