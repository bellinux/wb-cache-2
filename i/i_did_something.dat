500|$|... "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Palmer and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In October 2000, {{it was confirmed that}} singer-songwriter Cher would guest star on Will & Grace as herself. She filmed her appearance on October 17. Cher revealed, [...] "We did two endings. I improvised one. I hope they show it as an outtake 'cause the audience loved that one more than the one they're gonna show. Instead of the thing I was supposed to do, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to Sean [...] something completely different and he just about passed out. I don't know what possessed me." [...] It was also announced that actress Camryn Manheim would appear. Cher would later guest star on Will & Grace two years later.|$|E
500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "I {{left that}} room feeling hurt and humiliated. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> I {{virtually}} never do, as I said much earlier: I {{went out and}} got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on the windows could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and {{subsequently}} missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities. Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal {{during the rest of}} the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview [...] "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game." [...] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a [...]500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{month after}} writing these lines (which I have {{repeated}} in plain characters, on the bottle, {{for fear of}} accidents), I tried again--and failed again. Annoyed by this new disappointment, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> unworthy {{of me as a}} scientific man.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I rightly {{understand}} you, sir, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> very different. I got privately {{married to}} George, {{and he kept}} school near a twelvemonth longer, up behind the hill, {{though most of the}} young women were taken away from his teaching." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{son of a}} dear friend, a noble lord of Scotland, who {{followed}} the great Montrose's banner--afterwards joined the King in Scotland, and came with him as far as Worcester. He was wounded {{the day before the}} battle, and conjured me to take this youth under my charge, which <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>something</b> unwillingly; but I could not refuse a father, perhaps on his death-bed, pleading for the safety of an only son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> against {{received}} opinion, against precedent, and for aught I know against {{even the}} prejudices of those I wish to serve, however lofty my intention was and however great the benefit {{to them in}} the end, it would still be a sacrifice in the present." [...] He saw his own miserable logic and affected didactics, but he went on lightly, [...] "But why do you ask such a question? You haven't any one in your mind for me, have you?" ...|$|E
60|$|At last I {{ceased to}} wonder, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something.</b> I {{went to the}} city, and, after a day's hard work, I secured a {{position}} for my secretary in a large publishing establishment, where her husband could sit by a window in a secluded corner, and keep as quiet as a mouse. The good lady overwhelmed me with thanks for my kindness. She had begun to fear that, as the season grew colder, the daily trip would not suit her husband, {{and she gave me}} credit for having thought the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye look kind o' faint. Can't <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for ye? Got any pain-killer? That's good, well rubbed in," [...] volunteered the old woman.|$|R

6000|$|... “I knew she’d spot {{me by my}} clothes, and I {{played up}} to the part. It pleases people when you fall in with the ideas they form about you. But {{speaking}} of idlers reminds me that before I went away {{the old man was}} getting after me about wasting my talents; opined it was time <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something,</b> and said he’d stand for the losses I’d no doubt make {{in the first two years}} if I’d run the Canadian mill he’s lately bought. I pointed out that it might cost him more than the boats and cars, and he answered that he’d consider it as a fine for the way he brought me up. However, we won’t talk about that. It’s too fine a day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Seizing {{him by the}} {{shoulders}} I thrust him into a chair with {{his face to the}} wall, laid hold of his comb and brush, got behind him and went to work. He was trembling like a child, and knew no more what I was doing than if he had been brained. Now, Tom's head was a curiosity. His hair, which was remarkably thick, was like wire. Being cut rather short it stood out all over his scalp like the spines on a porcupine. It had been a favorite complaint of Tom's that he never could do anything to that head. I found no difficulty--I did something to it, though I blush to think what it was. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> which I feared he might discover if he looked in the mirror, so I carelessly pulled out my watch, sprung it open, gave a start and shouted-- ...|$|E
60|$|On one {{occasion}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> very naughty, and when called up for judgment {{fled to the}} dining-room, locked the door, and from my stronghold defied the whole world. I could have made my own terms, for it was near dinner time and the family must eat; but, alas for the treachery of the human heart! Frank betrayed me. He climbed in at the window, unlocked the door, and delivered me up to the foe. Nay, he even defended the base act, and helped bear the struggling culprit to imprisonment. That nearly broke my heart, for I believed he would stand by me as staunchly as I always stood by him. It was a sad blow, and I couldn't love or trust him any more. Peanuts and candy, ginger-snaps and car-rides were unavailing; even foot-ball could not reunite the broken friendship, {{and to this day}} I recollect the pang that entered my little heart when I lost my faith in the loyalty of my first boy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Caine made a guest {{appearance}} on The Future Sound of London's album Dead Cities, performing operatic vocals on the song [...] "Everyone in the World <b>Is</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Something</b> Without Me".|$|R

6000|$|Feb. 16, ’74.—Cabinet dinner 8-12. It went well. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> [...] towards {{snapping}} {{the ties}} and winding {{out of the}} coil. [...] Conversation afterwards with Granville, on the flags up and down. [...] Then with Wolverton. To bed at 1-3/4, but lay three hours awake [...] (rare with me) with an overwrought brain. ... 17.—12-½-6. Went to [...] Windsor, and {{on behalf of the}} cabinet resigned. Took with me [...] Merchant of Venice and Thomas à Kempis, each how admirable in [...] its way!(307) 20.—Went by 5.10 to Windsor, final audience and [...] kissed hands. Her Majesty very kind, the topics of conversation [...] were of course rather limited. 21.—I cleared my room in Downing [...] Street and bade it farewell, giving up my keys except the cabinet [...] key. 28.—Set aside about 300 vols. of pamphlets for the shambles. [...] March 3.—I have given up all my keys; quitted Downing Street a [...] week ago; not an official box remains. But I have still the daily [...] visit of a kind private secretary; when that drops all is over. [...] 5.—Hamilton paid me his last visit. To-morrow I encounter my own [...] correspondence single-handed.|$|E
60|$|When {{we closed}} up our wedding week, {{in which our}} Quaker had been so very {{handsome}} to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for her generous carriage to us; how she had acted the kindest part through the whole, and how faithful a friend she had been to me upon all occasions; and then letting him know a little of her family unhappiness, I proposed that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but really to do something extraordinary for her, towards making her easy in her affairs. And I added, that I had no hangers-on that should trouble him; that there was nobody belonged to me but what was thoroughly provided for, and that, if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> for this honest woman that was considerable, {{it should be the}} last gift I would give to anybody in the world but Amy; and as for her, we were not agoing to turn her adrift, but whenever anything offered for her, we would do as we saw cause; that, in the meantime, Amy was not poor, that she had saved together between seven and eight hundred pounds. By the way, I did not tell him how, and by what wicked ways she got it, but that she had it; and that was enough to let him know she would never be in want of us.|$|E
60|$|It {{is curious}} that I {{remember}} that shame and self accusation {{and its consequences}} far more distinctly than I recall the weeks of vacillation before I soared. For a time I went altogether without alcohol, I stopped smoking altogether and ate very sparingly, and every day <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> that called a little upon my nerves and muscles. I soared as frequently as I could. I substituted a motor-bicycle for the London train and took my chances in the southward traffic, and I even tried what thrills were to be got upon a horse. But they put me on made horses, and I conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes of equestrian exercise {{in comparison with the}} adventures of mechanism. Also I walked along the high wall at the back of Lady Grove garden, and at last brought myself to stride the gap where the gate comes. If I didn't altogether get rid of a certain giddy instinct by such exercises, at least I trained my will until it didn't matter. And soon I no longer dreaded flight, but was eager to go higher into the air, and I came to esteem soaring upon a glider, that even over the deepest dip in the ground had barely forty feet of fall beneath it, a mere mockery of what flight might be. I began to dream of the keener freshness in the air high above the beechwoods, and it was rather to satisfy that desire than as any legitimate development of my proper work that presently I turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my private income to the problem of the navigable balloon.|$|E
