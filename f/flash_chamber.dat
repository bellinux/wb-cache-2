40|$|Abstract. Brine {{recirculation}} {{pumps are}} essential components used for circulation of brine in multi-stage <b>flashing</b> <b>chambers</b> desalination plants. Failure of these pumps {{would result in}} shutdown of the desalination plants. The rotating parts of these pumps (shaft and impeller) are usually made out of stainless steels or Duplex stainless steels. The pressure parts (casings) are usually made out of Ni-resist ductile irons (NDI). In recent years {{there have been a}} number of cases in which NDI casing materials failed by stress corrosion cracking (SCC) especially in the Arabian Gulf region. This makes re-evaluation and further studies on the performance of these materials of paramount importance due to process-related economic and reliability considerations.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{a possibility for}} increasing the power output from diesel engines and improving the fuel economy for such engines. This is achieved by employing a power cycle which is driven solely by the engine waste-heat in the cooling water and, also, the exhaust gases. For road engines an organic fluid Rankine cycle is employed. R- 12 is evaporated in a boiler, fired by the coolant waste-heat. This is superheated using the exhaust-gases before it is introduced to a turbine where it expands down to an air-cooled condenser. The cycle power output can supplement the base engine power by about 16 % of its output. For stationary diesel engines, however, water is used in a steam Brayton power cycle. The released steam, from the cooling water in a <b>flashing</b> <b>chamber,</b> is compressed by a vapour compressor and superheated by the exhaust-gases. This steam is admitted to a turbine coupled to the compressor and {{the balance of the}} shaft power is the net output from the cycle. This amounts to about 15 Â· 3 % of the base engine output. The power cycles employed neither interfere with the operation of the base engine nor deny the application of a turbocharger to it.

40|$|Conventional low {{temperature}} thermal desalination (LTTD) uses ocean thermal temperature gradients {{to drive a}} single stage flash distillation process to produce pure water from seawater. While the temperature difference in the ocean drives distillation and provides cooling in LTTD, external electrical energy is required to pump the water streams from the ocean and to maintain a near vacuum in the <b>flash</b> <b>chamber.</b> In this work, an LTTD process from the literature is compared against, the thermodynamic least work and the minimum least work possible for the system, reverse osmosis (RO) and membrane distillation (MD), an alternative thermal desalination technology. In all cases compared, the product water flow rates, feed seawater inlet temperatures and cold seawater inlet conditions were held constant. Exergy and Second law analysis showed that for the LTTD system studied, under reversible operating conditions with no heat exchange with the atmosphere, a power production of 26 kWh/m 3 of product water was possible. At near zero recoveries (infinite warm feed flow rates) or allowing heat exchange with an infinite ambient at the warm water temperature, maximum power production possible was found to increase to 75 kWh/m 3. In contrast, the LTTD system in literature was found to consume 22 kWh/m 3 while standard seawater RO consumes 2. 3 kWh/m 3. MD {{was found to be}} an effective alternative LTTD technology. Switching to MD from flash distillation eliminates the need for vacuum pumps and also reduces the pumping power consumption by reducing both the required cool and warm water flow rates through increased recovery ratios. Furthermore, pressure drops in the condenser on the cool side and the requirement of pumping brine back to atmospheric pressure from a near vacuum in a conventional LTTD <b>flash</b> <b>chamber</b> are avoided. The proposed LTMD system can potentially perform competitively with RO by operating with a specific power consumption less than 2. 5 kWh/m 3, while retaining the environmental benefits of the conventional LTTD system.

Thermal and chemical assessment of the unit performance showed that the MSF distiller performance during the test period was smooth and steady.
