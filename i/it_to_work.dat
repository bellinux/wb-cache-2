5|$|Coggins {{was called}} up for Army service, and enlisted on April 8, 1943. He was pulled from basic {{training}} at Fort Eustis, Virginia {{before he could}} complete <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as an illustrator for YANK magazine. He was originally introduced to the Commanding Officer and Editor of YANK, Colonel Franklin Forsberg, by Fletcher Pratt. On May 20, 1943, Coggins commenced work at the head office of YANK in New York, where he worked until his departure for Britain. Jack Coggins became a naturalized citizen of the United States on August 19, 1943.|$|E
5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{accepted}} {{a job with}} Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush drew from Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher {{attend a}} museum, where they {{discover}} a broken time machine {{built in the}} 1880s on display. Endeavoring to travel through time themselves, they begin fixing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> properly. This catches the attention of their sister, Candace, who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble. When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine, Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues {{to walk to the}} boys, just as their time machine activates. The three are sent back to the Late Cretaceous Period (erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C.), where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the time machine. Now stranded, the three are forced to flee from the T. rex and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, the {{municipal}} council demanded that company return the Bica lift to operation, forcing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{on the line}} and install new cars, provided by the firm of Theodore Bell.

In 1927, the funicular returned to operation.|$|E

25|$|When {{considering}} actors for {{the part}} of Spock, the producers of the film sent Nimoy video footage of each one. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as {{he felt that the}} actor looked sufficiently like himself for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and that it seemed like Quinto could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto, who previously had appeared as Sylar in the television series Heroes, had heard about the production on the new film and expressed his interest in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.|$|E
25|$|DirectShow 6.0, {{released}} {{as part of}} DirectX Media introduced the Overlay Mixer renderer designed for DVD playback and broadcast video streams with closed captioning and subtitles. The Overlay Mixer uses DirectDraw 5 for rendering. Downstream connection with the Video Renderer is required for window management. Overlay Mixer also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with analog TV tuners with overlay capability (sending video directly to a video card via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{locomotive}} no. 86608 was experimentally regeared {{to allow}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> trains single handedly. It was reclassified as Class 86/5 and renumbered to 86501. This {{was the second}} time this classification and number had been used, the first occasion being former Class 86/2 dedicated to freight work in the late 1980s. Despite the apparent success of 86501's conversion, no further locomotives have been similar regeared. In mid-2004 the locomotive suffered fire-damage, but was subsequently repaired and returned to service, thereby demonstrating Freightliner's faith in its ability. 86501 again suffered fire-damage in August 2008 near Bletchley. It was subsequently repaired in December 2008 and returned to service shortly after.|$|E
25|$|By October 16, 2006, {{distributors}} {{using the}} Windows Media DRM protection, such as Sky Anytime, were using a patched codec. On September 6, 2007, Microsoft updated IBX to version 11.0.6000.7000, {{in an attempt}} to thwart circumvention efforts by variants of the original program. And, as of November 28, 2007, DRM Removal under Windows XP on new installs or updated computers (i.e. those that already contain IBX version 11.0.6000.7000), is not possible without rolling back to Windows Media Player 10. In 2008 another patched version of FairUse4WM was released, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Windows Vista, and IBX versions lower than 11.0.6000.6324. In a ploy to confuse the abusers or software tools, Microsoft revisited the controversial 11.0.6000.6324 version number, releasing a new IBX version, but giving the file a deceptive older version number.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} period, the US Army Air Force became {{interested}} in a very-high accuracy system for bombing pinpoint targets. Raytheon won a contract to develop a system called Cytac, which used the same basic techniques as LF LORAN, but included considerable automation to handle the timing internally without operator intervention. This proved to be extremely successful, with test-runs placing the aircraft within 10 yards of the target. As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) US Air Force lost interest in the concept. Nevertheless, they continued experimentation with the equipment after adapting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on LF LORAN frequencies and renaming it Cyclan, lowering accuracy compared to the original, but providing reasonable accuracy {{on the order of}} a mile at greatly increased distances.|$|E

25|$|The {{second of}} Hoyle's {{nucleosynthesis}} papers also introduced an interesting {{use of the}} anthropic principle, which was not then known by that name. In {{trying to work out}} the routes of stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the triple-alpha process, which generates carbon from helium, would require the carbon nucleus to have a very specific resonance energy and spin for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for carbon-based life-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles, which was later borne out by experiment.|$|E
25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
