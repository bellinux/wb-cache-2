40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of discarding was studied using a multidisciplinary approach {{to allow the}} integration of biological, social and economic data. The research aimed to evaluate {{the strength of the}} case to reduce discarding in a single case study fishery, the English Nephrops fishery; to <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> for discard reduction; to identify factors that inhibit discard reduction and to determine the best means of achieving those objectives. Changes in trawl structure offered the best solution while having the least impact on fishing opportunities. However, the inadequate level of incentive was identified as the main impediment to discard reduction rather than the lack of technical ability. To implement effective measures to reduce discarding in this fishery, an increased level of incentive is required. Three measures are identified as a means to achieve this.

40|$|New {{research}} {{techniques have}} recently been developed to gather measures of public opinion that is better informed or more deliberative than that recorded in typical mass opinion surveys. These techniques include deliberative polls, educational surveys, and citizen planning cells. In view of what {{they set out to}} accomplish, what can we say from a scientific perspective about the utility of these methods? How are we to best interpret the data they produce? To address these questions, this paper reviews several of the most prominent and well-developed examples of deliberative or educational polling. We argue two main points. First, these new methods of assessing public opinion must be evaluated in terms of specific quality criteria that apply to different phases and/or participants in the democratic decision making process. Some techniques attempt to maximize several distinct qualities at once, making it difficult to <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> for evaluating success. Second, at least five important core methodological elements of educational or deliberative polls can be identified, each of which can theoretically alter results.

TSFF stakeholders helped <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> and alternative management strategies for the fishery {{at a time when}} new management strategies were under consideration. A metapopulation and fishing simulation model was used to evaluate alternative management strategies related to harvest and conservation of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the main target species. Stakeholders identified objectives relating to conservation of unfished populations, maintenance of harvestable stock, and economic performance. In terms of management options, spatial closures decreased the prospects of meeting nearly all stakeholder objectives. A seasonal closure and larger minimum capture size increased the probability of meeting conservation and harvest objectives, but decreased the probability of meeting most economic objectives for both sectors. Increasing fishing effort increased harvest but decreased the catch rates for both sectors, so had varied effects on the probability of achieving harvest objectives. The research provides a case study of productive engagement with indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders to address fisheries management needs and provides a framework for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management strategies against stakeholder objectives...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{concerned}} with obtaining evidence to explore {{the proposition that the}} provision of occupational health services as arranged at the present time represents a misallocation of resources. The research has been undertaken within the occupational health service of a large Midlands food factory. As the research progressed it became evident that questions were being raised about the nature and scope of occupational health as well as the contribution, in combating danger at work, that occupational health services can make to the health and safety team. These questions have been scrutinized in depth, as they are clearly important, and a resolution of the problem of the definition of occupational health has been proposed. I have taken the approach of attempting to <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> or benefits of occupational health activities so {{that it is possible to}} assess how far these objectives are being achieved. I have looked at three aspects of occupational health; audiometry, physiotherapy and pre-employment medical examinations as these activities embody crucial concepts which are common to all activities in an occupational health programme. A three category classification of occupational health activities is proposed such that the three activities provide examples within each category. These are called personnel therapy, personnel input screening and personnel throughput screening. I conclude that I have not shown audiometry to be cost-effective. My observations of the physiotherapy service lead me to support the suggestion that there is a decline in sickness absence rates due to physiotherapy in industry. With pre-employment medical examinations I have shown that the service is product safety oriented and that benefits are extremely difficult to identify. In regard to the three services studied, in the one factory investigated, and because of the immeasurability of certain activities, I find support for the proposition that the mix of occupational health services as provided at the present time represents a misallocation of resources...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the attitudes of selected Illinois community college occupational students and program advisory committee members toward the objectives of general education. The study attempted to <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> of general education and to investigate the degree of importance ascribed to those objectives in occupational curricula by the students and advisory members. Specifically, this study examined the differences in the perception toward the relative importance of the objectives of general education between all occupational students and all program advisory committee members and between students and advisory members in each of five occupational clusters. This study also investigated differences in the perception toward the relative importance of the objectives of general education among occupational students in the five occupational clusters and among the advisory committee members in the five occupational clusters. Significant differences were observed in the perceived importance of some objectives of general education between occupational students and advisory committee members. These differences varied among the five occupational clusters. Significant differences were also observed in perceived importance among advisory committee members and among students in the five occupational clusters. No significant differences were observed in the order in which the 20 general education objectives were ranked utilizing mean response scores by occupational students and program advisory committee members. Of the 20 objectives, both occupational students and advisory committee members ranked the relative importance of Creation of Knowledge, Problem Solving, Communication of Knowledge, Desire for Knowledge, and Technical Foundation as the five most important objectives. Both groups ranked the relative importance of Place in Physical World, Personal Culture, Home and Family, World Membership, and Knowledge of Cultural Heritage among the six least important objectives. Advisory committee members perceived three of those objectives ranked highest as being significantly more important than did students. Those objectives were Creation of Knowledge, Problem Solving, and Technical Foundation. All five objectives ranked among the least important objectives were perceived by the advisory committee members as being significantly less important than did the students...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 {{federal funding}} was {{provided}} {{for the development of}} national foreign language standards for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. The resulting content standards (Standards for Foreign Language Learning: Preparingfor the 21 st Century) define what students {{should know and be able}} to do in grades four, eight, and twelve and were intended to 2 ̆ 2 serve as a gauge for excellence 2 ̆ 2 (National Standards in Foreign Language Learning Project 1996, 13). Like the mathematics goals, the foreign language goals were viewed as criteria for excellence rather than as a minimum level of competency (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics 1989, 2). The Standards for Foreign Language Learning comprise five general domains, or goals, that describe what students should know and be able to do. Each of these broad goals is elaborated on in more specific standards statements. These national goals and standards were intended to be used 2 ̆ 2 in conjunction with state and local frameworks and standards to determine the best approaches and reasonable expectations for the students in individual districts and schools 2 ̆ 2 (NSFLE Project 1996, 24). In this way, national, state, and district documents describe related sets of goals and standards that influence and inform one another. At the state level the Nebraska K- 12 Foreign Language Frameworks has as its mission to 2 ̆ 2 provide direction and support for school communities in the development and assessment of an articulated foreign language curriculum 2 ̆ 2 (Nebraska Department of Education 1996, 3). Like the national-level document, the state Frameworks document defines five broad goals for instruction and offers related sets of standards.

40|$|This {{report is}} devoted to the mapping of legal and policy {{instruments}} of the EU for human rights and democracy support. In particular, it highlights the EU´s human rights priorities in terms of themes and vulnerable groups in its external action based on a review of EU policy documents and literature. In order to do so the report first identifies the instruments that set up the frame of the human rights and democracy policy. The framework of the EU’s human rights and democracy policy is presided by the Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, which establishes the principles, objectives and priorities that must guide the EU’s action. Two general objectives, each with a different scope, can be identified in the Strategic Framework: the EU’s and its Member States’ commitment to promote the universality of human rights and the EU’s determination to promote human rights and democracy in its external action. In addition, the Strategic Framework highlights some areas of action which <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> and priority themes and groups. Although the Strategic Framework is on human rights and democracy, the emphasis throughout the document is on human rights, not on democracy. Democracy is ‘an aspiration’ that it is not defined. There are other relevant documents that set out the EU´s human rights and democracy policy. As well as general policy papers on mainstreaming human rights and promoting human rights and democracy in the EU external action, there are specific human rights guidelines on priority themes and vulnerable groups and human rights strategies towards particular third countries. In order to implement its human rights and democracy policy, the EU has developed a broad range of instruments. Some of them have been especially created in order to contribute to the specific objective of the promotion of human right and democracy worldwide; in particular, the EIDHR, the human rights clauses, the human rights focal points in EU Delegations, the EUSR for Human Rights, election support and the human rights dialogues and consultations. Moreover, the EU uses other traditional instruments of its CFSP to promote human rights and democracy in its relations with third countries. These instruments respond to the EU’s objective of mainstreaming human rights and democracy in all its policies and actions toward third countries. Among them, those that should be highlighted are the EU’s action in multilateral fora, bilateral political dialogues, démarches and declarations,, CFSP decisions, restrictive measures and, finally, thematic and geographic financial programmes. Regular assessment of the implementation of the EU’s human rights and democracy policy is one of the outcomes stated in the Action Plan. This evaluation of policy is mainly carried out through one specific instrument: the EU’s Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the world. In addition, {{as a consequence of the}} EU’s approach to put human rights at the core of its external action, human rights and democracy promotion constitute also an important part of other EU’s Annual Reports relating to other external policies, such as CFSP and Development...|$|E

40|$|US {{employers}} are facing an unprecedented opportunity to contribute toward positive, disruptive innovations in healthcare. The convergence of major trends will enable employers to exercise significant leverage in controlling healthcare costs and improving quality. US healthcare {{is ripe for}} disruptive innovations - cheaper, simpler, more convenient products or services that start by {{meeting the needs of}} less demanding customers. Employers view the healthcare system as overbuilt and off-focus for the needs of the average employer and employee. There are powerful driving forces and some restraining forces on employer leverage over employee health initiatives. On balance, employers have an interest in and an opportunity to leverage disruptive innovations in healthcare. One option that employers can use to leverage disruptive innovations in healthcare is partnership with health management vendors. While traditionally this association has been an arms-length customer/supplier relationship, there is an effective process for development of strategic partnerships that employers can use to better exert their latent influence on healthcare. There are at least 5 critical success factors for effective employer-vendor partnerships: 1. establish a formalized strategic planning process; 2. gain commitment and support early in the process; 3. <b>identify</b> <b>specific</b> goals, <b>objectives,</b> and accountabilities; 4. clearly define the partner selection process; and 5. clarify partner roles and expectations.

This study was performed to evaluate the capability of NMR imaging in the measurement of infarct size in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograpic (ECG) -gated spinecho NMR imaging was performed in 26 patients a mean of 9 ± 3 days (range 5 to 20) after infarction. The imaging technique used provided single-slice, spin-echo (time to echo [TE] = 60 ms) images of the left ventricle in its true short axis, allowing direct correlation of NMR infarct location and size with the region of severe hypokinesia on left ventriculography. In all 20 patients with complete NMR studies, infarct location was correctly <b>identified</b> by using <b>specific,</b> <b>objective</b> criteria.

The focus is placed on the institutional actors, without leaving out the actors of a different nature. The author addresses two main questions: in the complex system of EU dialogues - civil dialogue, social dialogue, political dialogue, human rights dialogue – what position does a specific “intercultural” dialogue have? Should it be a sectoral dialogue as many other, or should it be incorporated into human rights dialogue, or even should it be transversal to the already existing dialogues?

It was thus essential to evaluate the nature and scope of collaborative arrangements among human, animal, and wildlife health experts in dealing with health challenges which demand inter-sectoral partnership. The nature of collaborative arrangement was assessed, and the respective bridges and barriers {{over a period of}} 12 months (July 20011 to June 2012) were <b>identified.</b> The <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> were to: (1) determine the proportion of health experts who had collaborated with other experts of disciplines different from theirs, (2) r ank the general bridges for and barriers against collaboration according to the views of the health experts, and (3) f ind the actual bridges for and barriers against collaboration among the health experts interviewed.

Only 6. 7 % of the wildlife officers had collaborated with animal health experts. The main bridges for collaboration were instruction by upper level leaders, zoonotic diseases of serious impacts, and availability of funding. The main barriers for collaboration were lack of knowledge about animal/human health issues, lack of networks for collaboration, and lack of plans to collaborate.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of discards in European fisheries has been <b>identified</b> as a <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> {{of the reform}} of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the disposal of catch at sea, a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings {{can result in a}} reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur...|$|R

A public consultation on such topic has been started off by the EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloş, who has left for the moment the two dossiers aside, giving priority to the identification of the agricultural policy post- 2013 objectives. The {{debate on the}} new CAP reform, starting from the always ancient but modern general objectives which remained unchanged with the Lisbon Treaty, is now subject to an in-depth analysis and revision to <b>identify</b> new <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> in the wider framework of the European strategy 2010 identified by the EU executive body. However, the future outlooks can not neglect the need for stocktaking and what has been learned through the present and recent past experiences. In order to focus the theme of this special issue of the Italian Journal of Agronomy, we must remember that on 26 th June 2003, EU farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the CAP and introduced a new single payment scheme (SPS, or Single Farm Payment) intended to change the way the EU supported its farm sector by removing the link between subsidies and production of specific crops. The Single Farm Payment is linked to meeting environmental, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare standards and the need to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition. To gain funds from the SPS the Farmer has to cross comply - that is, to farm in an environmentally friendly way. COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1782 / 2003 states that: Member States shall define, at national or regional level, minimum requirements for good agricultural and environmental condition on the basis of the framework set up in Annex IV, taking into account the specific characteristics of the areas concerned, including soil and climatic condition, existing farming systems, land use, crop rotation, farming practices, and farm structures [...] . </em...|$|R
