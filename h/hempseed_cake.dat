40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of addition of technical hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) on performance parameters of broiler chickens. A total of 105 broilers Ross 308 were divided into three groups. The groups were identified: Cannabis 5, Cannabis 15 and Control. Group Cannabis 5 was fed with 5 % <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> in feed composition. Group of Cannabis 15 was fed with 15 % <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> in feed composition. Group of Control was not fed with <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake.</b> As a response criterion was chosen weight gain, feed conversion, lean meat, carcass yield and blood liver enzymes concentration. In this thesis, we focus on assessing the impact of hempseed cakes on weight gain, feed conversion and the carcass yield. The increments in body weight were significant statistical differences (P 0. 05) by content of <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> in feed composition. Measured concentration of enzymes in groups was not affected by contents of <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hempseed meal {{from three}} {{dioecious}} and three monoecious varieties has been evaluated for con-tent {{and quality of}} the protein and for the concentration of antinutritional compounds. Hemp seeds were obtained from plants grown in two experimental fields for two consecutive years (2011 - 2012). For all the varieties, hempseed meal resulted in a rich source of protein (34 % mean content) with an amino acid profile extremely rich in arginine and slightly poor in lysine. Differ-ences between dioecious and monoecious varieties were observed in the content of antinutri-tional compounds. They were more concentrated in monoecious varieties in comparison with those dioecious. The concentration of phytic acid in hempseed meal deserves attention in both groups, being 63 and 75. 4 g∙kg− 1 of dry matter in dioecious and monocieous varieties, respectively. The results show that, besides the recognized value of hemp oil, also the <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> could find application in animal feed as a substitute of other cakes (soybean, rapeseed). From this point of view, the dioecious varieties showing lower contents of antinutritional compounds with respect t...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate ruminal degradability and intestinal digestibility of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> (HC) that were moist heat treated at different temperatures. Samples of cold-pressed HC were autoclaved for 30 min at 110, 120 or 130 °C, and a sample of untreated HC was used as the control. Ruminal degradability of CP was estimated, using the in situ Dacron bag technique; intestinal CP digestibility was estimated for the 16 h in situ residue using a three-step in vitro procedure. AA content was determined for the HC samples (heat treated and untreated) of the intact feed, the 16 h in situ residue and the residue after the three-step procedure. There was a linear increase in RUP (p = 0. 001) and intestinal digestibility of RUP (p = 0. 003) with increasing temperature during heat treatment. The 130 °C treatment increased RUP from 259 to 629 g/kg CP, while intestinal digestibility increased from 176 to 730 g/kg RUP, compared to the control. Hence, the intestinal available dietary CP increased more than eight times. Increasing temperatures during heat treatment resulted in linear decreases in ruminal degradability of total AA (p = 0. 006) and individual AA (p< 0. 05) and an increase in intestinal digestibility that could be explained both by a linear and a quadratic model for total AA and most individual AA (p< 0. 05). The 130 °C treatment decreased ruminal degradability of total AA from 837 to 471 g/kg, while intestinal digestibility increased from 267 to 813 g/kg of rumen undegradable AA, compared with the control. There were differences between ruminal AA degradability and between intestinal AA digestibility within all individual HC treatments (p< 0. 001). It is concluded that moist heat treatment at 130 °C did not overprotect the CP of HC and could be used to shift the site of CP and AA digestion from the rumen to the small intestine. This may increase the value of HC as a protein supplement for ruminants...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of <b>hempseed</b> <b>cakes</b> in feed mixtures on the sensory meat quality of broiler chickens. During the experiment broiler chickens were fed with feed mixtures containing 5 % and 15 % of <b>hempseed</b> <b>cakes</b> and compared with the control group deprived of <b>hempseed</b> <b>cakes.</b> The total carcass yield, carcass yield of breast and thigh muscle, the amount of dry matter, crude protein and fat were determined. The pH and color of meat were measured {{and at the end}} of this experiment sensory evaluation of breast and thigh muscle was performed. For most sensory descriptors statistically significant differences were not demonstrated. Sensory evaluation of breast muscle determined a statistically significant difference (P < 0, 05) with descriptors of odour and fibrousness. Sensory evaluation of thigh muscle showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0, 05) with descriptors of odour, color, fibrousness and flavour...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the use {{of locally}} {{produced}} protein feeds in ruminant production systems in northern Europe would be a valuable development. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) can be cultivated at high latitudes and cold-pressing the seeds to extract the oil produces a residue, <b>hempseed</b> <b>cake</b> (HC), with a high protein content. The overall aim of the studies presented in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} possibilities of using HC as a protein feed for ruminants. The in vitro gas production technique was developed further in order to estimate rumen protein degradation; the effective protein degradation (EPD) of HC determined by this method was low (0. 33). When calculated from in situ crude protein (CP) disappearance, HC had a high EPD value (0. 71 - 0. 84) and a low in vitro intestinal digestibility (0. 18 - 0. 31) for the rumen undegradable protein (RUP). Moist heat treatment could be used to shift the site of CP digestion from the rumen to the small intestine. The highest temperature considered, 130 °C, was associated with the largest amount of RUP and rumen undegraded amino acids with the highest intestinal digestibility. A high proportion of the neutral detergent fibre in HC was indigestible (0. 85), which contributed to a low calculated metabolisable energy value (9. 5 MJ/kg dry matter). Increasing the proportion of HC (0, 143, 233 or 318 g/kg dry matter) in the diet of dairy cows produced effects on the yields of milk, energy corrected milk and milk protein, fat and lactose that could be described by quadratic functions; the highest production was achieved by cows fed the diet containing 143 g HC/kg dry matter. There were linear decreases in the concentration of milk fat and protein and CP efficiency (milk protein/CP intake), and a linear increase in milk urea, with increasing proportions of HC. Supplementing barley-based diets with peas or rapeseed cake improved the growth performance of lambs, but inclusion of HC resulted in an average daily gain similar to that achieved with the control diet containing no protein supplement. The results from the studies underlying this thesis indicate that the nutritional value of HC will limit its use as a protein feed for ruminants...|$|E
