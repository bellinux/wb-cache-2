5|$|The {{properties}} of heavy water {{had been discovered}} in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk <b>Hydro</b> Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production of heavy water in Norway. As Norsk <b>Hydro</b> were already producing ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer, Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available. Tronstad was paid by Norsk <b>Hydro</b> as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk <b>Hydro</b> had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production of heavy water. Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project.|$|E

5|$|During May 1908 {{the workers}} were not being paid {{regularly}} enough, and took to a strike on 6 June; 2,120 men were at the most in strike. As a consequence Norsk <b>Hydro</b> {{became a member of}} Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NAF). Negotiations were conducted in August, but failed—not until Minister of Labour Nils Claus Ihlen meddled and Sam Eyde pulled Norsk <b>Hydro</b> out of NAF and reduced his demands did the strike end, on 6 October.|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for <b>hydro</b> potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's <b>hydro</b> resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that Russia has much potential for using its <b>hydro</b> resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E

50|$|Over 80% of BC <b>Hydro's</b> {{installed}} in generating capacity is at hydroelectric installations in the Peace and Columbia river basins. The GM Shrum and Peace Canyon generating stations on the Peace River produced 29% of BC <b>Hydro's</b> electricity requirements. In the Columbia River Basin, Mica and Revelstoke hydroelectric plants together contributed 25%, while Kootenay Canal and Seven Mile generating stations together supplied 10%.|$|R

5|$|The {{plan had}} been {{producing}} a deficit since 1982. Norsk <b>Hydro</b> {{made an agreement}} with the authorities where they would create 350 new permanent jobs, create a business fund and donate NOK 60 million {{for the construction of a}} new road, Route 37 along Lake Tinn. In 1988 Norsk <b>Hydro</b> terminated the ammonia production, and in 1991 they also closed down the production ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate, along with the Rjukan Line. Within a few years the number of Norsk <b>Hydro</b> employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1,760 to 530 people; 24 of these were employed by Norsk Transport operating the railway and railway ferries. All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro's enterprise.|$|E
40|$|Several {{successful}} algorithms {{have been}} developed to estimate soil moisture of bare surfaces. We previously reported a new algorithm using the tilted Bragg approximation. However, these algorithms are only applicable to bare surfaces. When vegetation is present, soil moisture is typically underestimated by bare surface algorithms. In order to derive soil moisture under vegetation, we have to understand the complex scattering process due to vegetation. Our main interest is to retrieve the global soil moisture information using <b>Hydros</b> L-band polarimetric radar data. The <b>Hydros</b> mission will provide the first global view of land soil moisture using L-band radar and radiometer. The unique characteristics of the <b>Hydros</b> data are the availability of the low resolution soil moisture information from radiometer data and the continuous time series radar data collected at the same incidence angle. In this paper, we will examine a potential inversion algorithm to retrieve soil moisture under vegetation canopies using <b>Hydros</b> L-band polarimetric radar data...|$|R

5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's <b>Hydro</b> One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after <b>hydro</b> rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that <b>Hydro</b> One would remain under public control.|$|E
