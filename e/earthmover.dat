25|$|On 5 March, Sapper Adam Moralee, aged 23, from 32 Engineer Regiment, died {{preparing}} engineer {{plant equipment}} for redeployment within Camp Bastion. Moralee was killed instantly when the bucket on the <b>earthmover</b> {{that he and}} his team were cleaning moved downwards and one of its teeth speared him between the shoulder blades. In April 2017, two members of the cleaning team were sentenced at a military court in Catterick to nine months in prison (for the Lance corporal in charge) and an 18 month suspended prison term with a curfew for the operative who moved the lever in the cab and made the bucket fall. Both were initially charged with manslaughter, but were both convicted on a lesser charge of negligence.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, {{he was assigned to}} B Company, 11th Engineer Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division. His company was supporting the 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment as it made its way through the Karbala Gap, across the Euphrates River and to Saddam International Airport (BIAP) in Baghdad. On April 4, 2003, a 100-man force was assigned to block the highway between Baghdad and the airport, about one mile east of the airport. After a brief battle, several of the Iraqis were captured. Smith spotted a walled enclosure nearby with a tower overlooking it. He and his squad set about building an impromptu enemy prisoner of war (EPW) holding area in the enclosure. Smith and 16 other men used an Armored Combat <b>Earthmover</b> (similar to a bulldozer) to knock a hole in the south wall of the courtyard. On the north side, there was a metal gate that Smith assigned several men to guard. These men noticed 50–100 Iraqi fighters who had taken positions in trenches just beyond the gate. He summoned a Bradley fighting vehicle to attack their position. Three nearby M113 Armored Personnel Carriers came to support the attack. An M113 was hit, possibly by a mortar, and all three crewmen were wounded. The Bradley, damaged and running low on ammunition, withdrew to reload during a lull in the battle. Smith organized the evacuation of the injured M113 crewmen. However, behind the courtyard was a military aid station crowded with 100 combat casualties. To protect it from being overrun, Smith chose to fight on rather than withdraw with the wounded.|$|E

50|$|In Operation Desert Storm the M9 Armored Combat <b>Earthmover</b> (ACE) {{performed}} {{exceptionally well}} {{in support of}} combat operations. The ACE {{proved to be a}} successful combination of armored vehicle and combat <b>earthmover</b> that was capable of keeping pace with the manoeuvre units, while providing crew survivability. While not as efficient as the D7 Dozer in earth moving, its ability to move with maneuver forces over several hundred kilometers of desert allowed it to successfully perform a wide variety of missions such as construction of combat roads and trails, survivability positions and berms. It can not, however, move as fast as an M1 or M2. The vehicle is governed to prevent this.|$|E
