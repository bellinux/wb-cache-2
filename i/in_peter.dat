She starred {{in the title role}} in a touring company {{production}} in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the subsequent version starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Peter</b> Jackson's Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003), {{all of the}} elves (including Wood Elves) {{are portrayed}} as fair, graceful, and wise beings with supernatural {{abilities}} like enhanced eyesight. While they facially resemble humans, they transcend beauty, with much longer and finer hair and an apparent inner glow. They also have pointed ears and no facial hair.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{many other}} British and Irish actors, Nesbitt was cast <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Jackson's three-part film The Hobbit, as the dwarf Bofur. Nesbitt had not read J.R.R. Tolkien's novel but {{accepted}} the role immediately. As {{the film was}} scheduled to take over 12 months to make in New Zealand, Nesbitt's wife and daughters moved with him, and his daughters were enrolled in a New Zealand school.

5|$|As {{speculation}} of {{a move to}} Hibernian came {{to nothing}} (despite his being installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell {{at the end of}} June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales. To do this he fended off competition from Aidy Boothroyd, Lawrie Sanchez, and Steve Staunton. At the start of his reign he had a limited squad, and had to draft in youth players for the Llanelli game. The club had sold off some of their best players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Ward as assistant manager.|$|E
5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} {{in the wake of}} the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E

5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
5|$|Jemima Puddle-Duck was popular, {{almost as}} popular as Peter Rabbit, and {{became the subject of}} {{ancillary}} merchandise. She is depicted in one of the four well known endpapers of the Potter books, and was featured on a Christmas card for the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She became the principal character in an unpublished painting book describing the livestock at Hill Top, and appeared <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Rabbit's Painting Book and Tom Kitten's Painting Book before being given her own painting book, Jemima Puddle-Duck's Painting Book in 1925, composed grudgingly in response to public demand for yet another book.|$|E
5|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw was {{originally}} published by William Godwin's publishing firm, M. J. Godwin, in 1808 {{as part of}} its Juvenile Library series. English editions have been located for 1811, 1812, 1823, and 1830 and Philadelphia editions have been located for 1814 and c. 1824. The original edition was illustrated by a protégé of Godwin, William Mulready. Shelley biographer Emily Sunstein speculates that some of the verses may have been written to match illustrations that were already designed. The copper plate engravings are reproduced <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> and Iona Opie's Nursery Companion.|$|E

Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|E
5|$|Robert Eddison as the Grail Knight: The {{guardian}} of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal {{as long as he}} stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released.|$|E

5|$|Scholar M.

Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion and {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. The Monmouth Rebellion plays a key role <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, {{play a role in the}} Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E

Alan Alda revisited his role as Richard Feynman <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Parnell's play QED in a staged reading at Columbia University's Miller Theatre, and the choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church joined Oliver Sacks in an exploration of music and science. The festival also saw the première of Dear Albert, a reading for the stage written by Alda based on the letters of Albert Einstein, and starring Anthony LaPaglia as Einstein.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{elements}} of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report. His character has a chocolate portrait of Viggo Mortensen (who portrayed Aragorn <b>in</b> <b>Peter</b> Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films) {{in a place of}} honor on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the Reports September 13, 2007 episode.
