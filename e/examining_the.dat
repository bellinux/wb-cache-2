5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> visual field, or by <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

5|$|Sub-disciplines {{of biology}} {{are defined by}} the scale at which life is studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: {{biochemistry}} <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; cellular biology <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> basic building-block of all life, <b>the</b> cell; physiology <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems; ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment; and evolutionary biology <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> processes that produced the diversity of life.|$|R

5|$|A {{researcher}} <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> skeleton identifies it as {{the missing}} victim from 1933. However, {{there seems to be}} no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding in the trunk of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
30|$|This paper <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> causal {{relationship}} between electricity consumption and sectoral output growth in Uganda. Although {{a number of}} studies have <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth, only very few—if any—have <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> dynamic sectoral linkages. This study therefore provides novel insights in the sectoral output growth and electricity consumption dynamics in Uganda.|$|R
40|$|Advancement in {{technologies}} is reshaping how we view {{social networking}} sites. These advancements have opened new opportunities {{in which we}} can integrate the social networking site with the learning process of students and lecturers. This research is based on the descriptive object and explanatory object, for the main purpose of exploring a new area of research. The research will employ the use of student experiences to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> impact of social networking site on their educational experience and student life. Therefore, the main objectives of the research are 1) to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> relationship between social networking and learning outcome; 2) to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> relationship between social networking and Student Learning; 3) To <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> relationship between social networking and Student Engagement; 4) to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Student Learning and learning outcome; and 5) to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Student Engagement and learning outcome...|$|R

5|$|After <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> {{practice}} of other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be {{divided between the}} front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{casualty}} {{figures for}} the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having the}} world's largest {{collection}} of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides <b>examining</b> <b>the</b> collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government.
