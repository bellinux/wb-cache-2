40|$|Objective: There are {{challenges}} in delivering maternal and infant health (MIH) care to remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. These include fragmented care with birthing in regional hospitals resulting in cultural and geographical dislocation for Aboriginal women. Many NT initiatives {{are aimed at}} improving care. Indicators for evaluating these for remote Aboriginal mothers and infants need to be clearer. We reviewed existing indicators to inform a set of pragmatic indicators for reporting improvement in remote MIH care. Methods: Scientific databases and grey literature (organisational websites and Google Scholar) were searched using the terms ‘Aboriginal/maternal/infant/remote health/monitoring performance’. Key stakeholders identified omitted indicators sets. Relevant sets were reviewed and organised by <b>indicator</b> <b>type,</b> stage of patient journey, topic and theme. Results: Forty-two indicators sets were found. Seven focused on Aboriginal health, 23 on reproductive/maternal health, eight on child/infant health and four on other aspects, e. g. remote health. We identified more than 1, 000 individual indicators. Of these, 656 were relevant for our purpose and were subsequently organised into 300 topics and 16 themes for antenatal, birth and postpartum, and infant care by <b>indicator</b> <b>type.</b> Conclusion: There are many measures for monitoring health care delivery to mothers and infants. Few are framed around remote MIH services, despite poorer health outcomes of remote mothers and infants and the specific challenges with providing care in this setting. Establishing relevant indicators is vital to support relevant data collection {{and the development of}} appropriate policy for remote Aboriginal maternal and infant care.

40|$|Abstract—Accurate load {{prediction}} plays a {{major role}} in devising effective power system control strategies. Successful prediction systems often use machine learning (ML) methods. The success of ML methods, among other things, depends on a suitable choice of input features which are usually selected by domain-experts. In this paper, we propose a novel systematic way of generating and selecting better features for daily peak electricity load prediction using kernel methods. Grammatical evolution is used to evolve an initial popula-tion of well performing individuals, which are subsequently mapped to feature subsets derived from wavelets and technical <b>indicator</b> <b>type</b> formulae used in finance. It is shown that the generated features can improve results, while requiring no domain-specific knowledge. The proposed method is focused on feature generation and can be applied to a wide range of ML architectures and applications.

40|$|Although seagrass-based {{indicators}} {{are widely used}} to assess coastal ecosystem status, there is little universality in their application. Matching the plethora of available indicators to specific management objectives requires a detailed knowledge of their species-specific sensitivities and their response time to environmental stressors. We conducted an extensive survey of experimental studies to determine the sensitivity and response time of seagrass indicators to ecosystem degradation and recovery. We identified seagrass size and <b>indicator</b> <b>type</b> (i. e. level of biological organization of the measure) as the main factors affecting indicator sensitivity and response time to degradation and recovery. While structural and demographic parameters (e. g. shoot density, biomass) show a high and unspecific sensitivity, biochemical/physiological indicators present more stressor-specific responses and are the most sensitive detecting early phases of environmental improvement. Based on these results we present a simple decision tree to assist ecosystem managers to match adequate and reliable indicators to specific management goals. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to discuss and show the policy {{relevance}} of "environmental load displacement" adjustments to national aggregate (macroeconomic) indicators for taking account of openness to the rest of the world. A national economy is considered as a set of production and consumption sectors interdependent with (i) natural processes and (ii) other national economies. In this structural perspective, three distinct "adjustment" concepts are put to work in the development of aggregate indicators. The first type of adjustment centres on accounting conventions, through an enlargement of the scope of national accounting to include specified monetary accounting for selected categories of environmental assets. This is the basis for construction of an "Aggregate Indicator of the Change, during the Current year, in the economic Assets of the Nation" (AICCAN for short). The second <b>indicator</b> <b>type</b> is based on hypotheses of adjustment of the economy itself that is, modelling of an "adjusted economy" which respects specified environmental performance standards. We call the corresponding indicators "greened economy GDP" (geGDP for short). In the third adjustment procedure, the AICCAN/geGDP concepts are maintained, and further classifications are introduced for making the distinction between "costs borne" and "costs caused" by a nation. A simple typology of the different types of between-nation "load displacement" is presented, and a variety of selected examples is presented of different types of "inter-country environmental load displacement" indicator concepts and empirical results that can be found in the published literature. Perspectives are developed for future research that can deepen statistical analysis of patterns of ecologically unequal exchange between countries. adjusted aggregate; AICCAN; ecologically unequal exchange; environmental load displacement; greened economy GDP; indicators; national accounts; political economy; statistics; sustainability. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{political}} interest in road safety problems and to learn from other countries’ ‘good practices’, it is often helpful to compare one’s own safety situation with that of other countries. In a number of projects tools {{have been developed for}} such comparisons. These tools range from simple ratings of countries on their safety outcomes, such as the annual number of fatalities per capita or per kilometre driven by (motor) vehicles to more comprehensive comparisons. These comparisons not only show differences in safety between countries, but to a certain extent also explain such differences in terms of their safety background and measures taken. Finally, tools have been defined to support road safety policy makers in developing possible safety measures or actions. Procedures for such complex safety comparisons have been developed and tested in several so-called SUNflower studies. This promising approach can be further developed into standard procedures for safety comparisons between all countries in the European Union, and other countries worldwide. This paper wishes to outline the development of such standards for the benchmarking of road safety and safety trends as well as procedures for quantifying safety performances of countries. Starting point of this conceptual framework is the so-called SUNflower-pyramid in which three types of indicators are distinguished. The first one of these, the road safety performance indicator, is called an outcome indicator and is {{based on the number of}} killed and injured road users. The second <b>indicator</b> <b>type</b> indicates the quality of the implementation of road safety policies: the implementation performance indicators. The third type of indicator indicates the quality of response in policy documents to improve road safety (policy performance indicator). The three types of indicators are embedded in a policy context: the structure and culture of a country, which are considered as background variables. This paper sets out to describe the framework for the development of a comprehensive set of indicators to benchmark road safety performances of countries or of sub-national jurisdictions. The paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of combining such indicators and if combined, how to aggregate how different indicators in one composite performance index. It is argued to group countries in different classes with more or less comparable countries. Different procedures are used for this grouping. The results are promising and it is recommended to work with classes of countries. (Author/publisher...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{sustainability}} of wildlife hunting, particularly in Central Africa, have dominated the scientific literature on wildlife utilization. Only more recently have researchers began considering the human dependence on wildlife for both nutritional needs as well as sources of livelihoods. I begin with a systematic literature review of the wildlife harvesting literature, examining in detail the type of sustainability indicators predominating in the literature and their strengths and weaknesses. We find that <b>indicator</b> <b>type,</b> continent of study, species body mass, taxonomic group, and socioeconomic status of study site are important predictors of the probability of reported sustainability. Indicators relying on population-specific biological data are most often used in North America and Europe, while cruder estimates are more often used in Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. Our results highlight both the uncertainty and lack of uniformity in sustainability science. This presents a major gap {{in our ability to}} monitor wildlife and its use, since the importance of wildlife for human consumption is at its greatest precisely in the places where indicators used are the weakest. We point to future directions in the field. Subsequent field work was conducted in the humid forest zone of southeastern Cameroon in Central Africa. Cameroon is one of the six Congo Basin countries, and there has traditionally been great concern on the part of environmental conservation organizations over the level of wildlife hunting in the country. The first part of my field work was a pilot study to compare field methodologies for wildlife consumption by rural peoples. For wildlife surveys, I used distance sampling on wildlife transects to determine presence/absence and abundance of wildlife species in four different village sites that represent a gradient of human impact and environmental intactness. To evaluate human use of wildlife relative to economic status, I used household surveys with heads of households to ascertain relative wealth status and other household demographic and economic parameters as they relate to wildlife use and consumption. Finally, I tested methodologies for enumerating hunter activity and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) as a potentially useful tool for monitoring the status of hunting sustainability. Results indicate that transect surveys do in fact detect increasing wildlife species in more rural, intact village sites, although sample sizes were too small to enumerate actual wildlife densities. Further, more rural households tend to both hunt and consume more wildlife; wildlife use in rural areas thus forms a more important source of total livelihood than for more urban households. Although humans have hunted wildlife for millennia, and it remains an important source of animal protein, there is increasing concern that `bushmeat' hunting, particularly in central Africa, is unsustainable. We explore the role that wildlife and alternative meat sources play in the food security of human populations in southeastern Cameroon. We conducted a large, cross-sectional study in 24 village and town sites in southeastern Cameroon to evaluate the role of wildlife in human food security in a gradient from urban to rural households. Rural households are significantly more likely to rely on wildlife for animal protein, whereas urban households rely on significantly more domestic meat. Using generalized linear mixed modeling, we found significant associations between bushmeat hunting and consumption and positive effects on food security, highlighting the importance of wildlife to human security in the Congo Basin. We asked interviewees about most consumed and most preferred wildlife species; interestingly, there is a potential synergy between taste preferences and the more resilient species that are hunted. These results indicate that wildlife consumption {{plays an important role in}} human food security in the humid forest zone of southeastern Cameroon. Disappearance of wildlife would negatively impact the food security situation in the region, particularly in the forms of protein-energy malnutrition and iron deficiency. At present, there is little ability to maintain small animal husbandry due to the poor veterinary services throughout the region. I evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a `Heifer International' model extended to two of the ten provinces in Cameroon that make up the region where wildlife hunting is currently the most important form of animal protein, consisting of the Southern and Eastern provinces ("Regions"), which together have a population of about 1 million people. The Heifer International model would replace the animal protein traditionally taken from wildlife sources with a revolving "micro-loan" of livestock, that must be eventually passed on to neighbors. At a population density of around 8 people/km 2, wildlife hunting is believed to be at least four times above maximum sustainable wildlife hunting rates, and therefore supplementary forms of animal protein need to come from elsewhere. Assuming administrative and training costs are included in the prices of the animals as estimated, a `Heifer International' model of small animal husbandry would be a cost-effective way to address protein-energy malnutrition and iron deficiency, as well as wildlife conservation concerns in this part of the world...|$|E
