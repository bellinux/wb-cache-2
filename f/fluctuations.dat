5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic <b>fluctuations,</b> giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density <b>fluctuations</b> are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large <b>fluctuations.</b> The effect of density <b>fluctuations</b> is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density <b>fluctuations,</b> and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

Studies show that it is of instructive significance to study the law of cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of coal production for formulating a reasonable coal resource developing plan and guaranteeing the coal supply. Adopting the theory and study framework of the economic cycle <b>fluctuation,</b> this thesis takes the total coal output in China as the object of the study and estimates the <b>fluctuation</b> of coal production by using the econometric methods such as CF filter and the like. Studies show that there {{is a major}} cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of 6 years and a seasonal <b>fluctuation</b> of 3 to 6 months of the coal production in China. The additional analysis shows that there is a long term co-integration relationship of the cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of macro economy and seasonal <b>fluctuation</b> of thermal power generation to the cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of coal production in China, which are the major causes of the cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of the coal production; among them, the cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of macro economy has an unidirectional influence on that of the coal production, while the seasonal <b>fluctuation</b> of thermal power generation and the cycle <b>fluctuation</b> of coal production have bidirectional influence...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fluctuation</b> of {{drive for}} slimness was {{investigated}} in the present study. Although the strength of drive for slimness is not static and constant but is variable, depending on the situation, {{little is known about}} this <b>fluctuation.</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} is to analyze the effects of psychological factors on <b>fluctuation</b> of drive for slimness. In the present study, in order to examine <b>fluctuation,</b> two kinds of concrete situation in which drive for slimness might be high in one situation, and be low in the other were presented. Discrepancy between the two drive for slimness scores was interpreted as <b>fluctuation</b> score. As psychological factors, the effects of narcissistic personality, approval motivation, and sensitivity of social desirability on <b>fluctuation</b> were investigated. The results showed that self-insistance (narcissistic personality) and social skill (approval motivation) had effects on <b>fluctuation,</b> and that the low <b>fluctuation</b> and high drive for slimness group had high approval motivation. There is room for further investigation into the <b>fluctuation</b> of drive for slimness. The first question to be discussed is the significance of <b>fluctuation.</b> Large <b>fluctuation</b> admits of two incompatible interpretations, one is a low drive for thinness and the other is a high drive. The problem of significance of <b>fluctuation</b> remains to be solved. ...|$|R

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature <b>fluctuations</b> (i.e. <b>fluctuations</b> which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial <b>fluctuations</b> in the density of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year <b>fluctuations</b> in the abundance of short lived forage fish can be nearly as great as the <b>fluctuations</b> that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that <b>fluctuations</b> in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind <b>fluctuations</b> in abundance. Annual <b>fluctuations</b> often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.|$|E

In advanced-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD), motor <b>fluctuation</b> is a frequent and disabling problem. Assessment of motor <b>fluctuation</b> depends on patient’s subjective self-statement. We examined whether the subjective <b>fluctuation</b> matched the objective motor <b>fluctuation</b> defined by gait disorders. Using a new device, the portable gait rhythmogram, we recorded gait cadence and acceleration continuously over the 24 -hour period in 54 patients with PD and 17 normal controls, for the quantitative evaluation of motor <b>fluctuation.</b> The patients were asked to estimate motor <b>fluctuation</b> every hour. In 44 of 54 patients, changes in the cadence were associated with simultaneous changes in acceleration. We examined the subjective <b>fluctuation</b> in these 44 patients who were confirmed to have motor <b>fluctuation.</b> Nineteen (82. 7 %) of 23 patients who felt no <b>fluctuation</b> showed distinct gait disorders. During off time, they walked with marked short or bradykinetic stepping. No matching changes were observed in either the cadence or acceleration in 11 (52. 4 %) of 21 patients who perceived motor <b>fluctuation.</b> No synchronization was noted in 30 (68. 2 %) of the 44 patients, between the times of subjectively assessed motor <b>fluctuation</b> and those of quantitative analysis o...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, random field theory has been {{increasingly}} used to model the inherent soil variability.

In this study, the factors affecting an accurate estimation of the scale of <b>fluctuation</b> were studied with numerical experiments to show how a proper sampling strategy can help improve the estimate of scale of <b>fluctuation.</b> Hypothetical data sets were generated from random field theory. Data were then sampled for different sampling strategies. The scale of <b>fluctuation</b> estimated from the sampling programs were compared with the predefined scale of <b>fluctuation.</b> The accuracy with which one can estimate scale of <b>fluctuation</b> depends on both the sampling intensity and extent of the sampling range. For the numerical example in this study, the sampling interval should be close enough such that 10 samples are measured within one scale of <b>fluctuation,</b> and the distance covered by the sampling should cover at least 100 scales of <b>fluctuation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the extent and {{implications}} of short-term hearing <b>fluctuation</b> in Meniere's disease. Thirty-six subjects diagnosed with Meniere's were recruited to measure their own hearing using in-situ audiometry via a hearing aid (Widex Diva) and a portable programmer (SP 3). Self-hearing tests measuring up to 14 frequency bands were conducted {{three times a day}} over eight weeks using the expanded SensogramTM. Twenty-three ears showed low frequency <b>fluctuation</b> while ten fluctuated in mid frequencies with some ‘double peak’ audiogram configurations. Eight ears in the later stages of Meniere's, contrary to expected, also recorded <b>fluctuation</b> across all frequencies. Self-hearing testing Meniere's ears over eight weeks revealed great hearing <b>fluctuation</b> with significant changes in audiogram configuration.
