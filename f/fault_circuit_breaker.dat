50|$|Two {{types of}} wiring {{protection}} are standard thermal breakers and arc fault circuit breakers. Thermal breakers require an overload condition {{long enough that}} a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs {{in a very small}} area. A problem with arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{they are more likely to}} produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults.

Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} of the electrical plant, equipment and components in aerospace applications represents a topic of advanced researches. In the last years, in particular, great efforts have {{been focused on the}} problem of the arc-fault detection. The impressive advancement of the electronic devices has been exploited. As well known, in many cases the arcs are not detected by the conventional overcurrent breakers, despite their effects can be as serious as those produced by a short-circuit, since they may cause fires on board the aircrafts. Arc-fault detection requires recognizing the arc signature contained in the current waveform. For this reason, an inescapable choice to face this problem is to adopt proper digital signal processing techniques. The detection reliability strongly depends on the criteria adopted in order to discriminate the arcing condition from other possible artefacts, due for example to normal electrical transients. In a previous work, the authors have proposed a technique based on the estimation of the energy which {{may be related to the}} arcing activity. It has been proven that it allows to establish a solid decision-making process for the parallel arc detection. In this paper the aspects related to the practical implementation of the proposed method are faced, with particular care to the impact of the unavoidable measurements uncertainties on the reliability of the method. This analysis has led to the development of an advanced prototype of a low-cost single-chip parallel arc fault detector, which can be employed to develop a very attractive AFCB (Arc <b>Fault</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Breaker).</b> A deep experimental activity has been hence carried out in laboratory. The well-recognized guillotine test has been used in order to assess the actual behaviour of the developed device...|$|E

Three types of wire used in commercial aircraft were evaluated: MIL-W- 22759 / 34 (150 C rated), MIL-W- 81381 / 12 (200 C rated), and BMS 1360 (260 C rated).

Over current protection also includes the protection against over loads and this is most widely used protection. Over loading of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on insulation class and material. Over current protection against overload is generally provided by thermal relays. Over current protection also includes protection against short-circuit.
