5|$|With Reed's approval, Lochry began {{recruiting}} men for Clark's expedition. Many Westmoreland men <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{leave their}} homes undefended, and so Lochry was only able to enlist about 100 volunteers for the campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{speculation}} and party infighting, {{he said he}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become Prime Minister. In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the more politically powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E

5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote {{it because he was}} imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|District Attorney Jim Garrison subpoenaed Altgens {{to appear}} in New Orleans, Louisiana for the 1969 trial of {{businessman}} Clay Shaw on charges of conspiring to kill Kennedy.

50|$|Mast aft rigs {{depend on}} a large {{foresail}} which, like any sail, becomes more difficult to manage with its size.

5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do anything that could damage his brain.|$|E
5|$|For {{the opening}} credits, Maurice Binder had {{disagreements}} with the producers and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> return. Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto {{clouds in the}} 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women in the Bond films' title sequences.|$|E
5|$|Formula, Vol. 1 {{contains}} fifteen tracks, most {{of which}} were written by Romeo Santos and co-produced by Ivan Chevere.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1976, though an Associated Press report in August 1975 had suggested filming would start in late 1975.

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{started on}} a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced.
