30|$|The present work aims at {{evaluation}} of the potential of cyanobacterial biomass to remove Cu(II) from simulated wastewater. Both <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> forms of Lyngbya majuscula, a cyanobacterial strain, {{have been used for}} such purpose. The influences of different experimental parameters viz., initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH and adsorbent dose have been examined on sorption of Cu(II). Kinetic and equilibrium studies on Cu(II) removal from simulated wastewater have been done using both <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass individually. Pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm have been found to fit most satisfactorily to the kinetic and equilibrium data, respectively. Maximum 87.99 and 99.15  % of Cu(II) removal have been achieved with initial Cu(II) concentration of 10 and 25  mg/L for <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algae, respectively, at an adsorbent dose of 10  g/L for 20  min of contact time and optimum pH 6. To optimize the removal process, Response Surface Methodology has been employed using both the <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass. Removal with initial Cu(II) concentration of 20  mg/L, with 0.25  g adsorbent dose in 50  mL solution at pH 6 {{has been found to be}} optimum with both the adsorbents. This is the first ever attempt to make a comparative study on Cu(II) removal using both <b>dried</b> algal biomass <b>and</b> its activated carbon. Furthermore, regeneration of matrix was attempted and more than 70 % and 80 % of the adsorbent has been regenerated successfully in the case of <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass respectively upto the 3 rd cycle of regeneration study.|$|R
30|$|East Kolkata Wetland (EKW) is a {{biodiversity}} rich region (Kundu et al. 2008). Different industries like paints, electroplating, {{and battery}} discharge their waste into the ponds of wetland. Wastes of these industries act as source of different metals like chromium, copper, etc. and phytoplankton {{found in this}} wetland area are highly resistant to these metals. In the present work, the cyanobacterium strain Lyngbya majuscula, collected from EKW site, {{has been used for}} sorption study of Cu(II) from its aqueous solution. It is a filamentous non-heterocystous cyanobacteria belonging to the family Oscillatoriaceae. Though few works have been done either with dried algal biomass or carbonized algal biomass, the usage of both <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> form of L. majuscula for abatement of heavy metal from wastewater is extremely terse. Therefore, in the present study, the efficacy of both <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass of L. majuscula in removal of Cu(II) from simulated wastewater is assessed.|$|R
30|$|The {{potential}} of L. majuscula, a cyanobacterium, in removal of Cu(II) from simulated wastewater has been explored {{in the present}} study. The sorption of Cu(II) onto the adsorbents increases with increase in solution pH 2 – 6. At pH higher than 7, the precipitation of insoluble metal hydroxides is observed that restricts the true biosorption studies. The kinetics of the sorption process was found to follow Pseudo-second-order model (PSOM). The maximum Cu(II) uptake capacity has been found 35.71 and 8.33  mg/g for <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algae, respectively. Study reveals that carbonized algal material is highly efficient only at lower Cu(II) concentration whereas dried algal biomass has been found effective both at lower and higher Cu(II) concentration. To optimize Cu(II) removal, RSM has been employed considering type of adsorbent namely <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algal biomass, as categoric factor. Percentage removal of Cu(II) has been found optimum with initial Cu(II) concentration of 20 mg/L, adsorbent dose of 0.25 g at solution pH 6 with both the adsorbents. Owing {{to the advantage of}} high metal biosorption capacity, the dried biomass of L. majuscula can efficiently be used as an adsorbent for removal of heavy metals from wastewater streams.|$|R
30|$|The {{topographical}} {{characterization of}} <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algal biomass {{before and after}} Cu(II) removal were done through SEM (JEISS EVO 18, GERMANY) and SEM (JSM 6700 F, JEOL, Japan), respectively. The samples were mounted on brass stubs using double-sided adhesive tape. The coated samples were brought into the SEM unit under vacuum. Once a certain pressure had been reached, the photographs were taken at the required magnification at room temperature. Chemical composition of dried algae loaded with Cu(II) was analyzed by energy dispersion X-ray spectrometer (FEI Quanta 200, USA).|$|R
30|$|Response Surface Methodology was {{employed}} for optimization of Cu(II) removal from its aqueous solution. The efficiency of both <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass was compared for sorption of Cu(II) and the removal condition was optimized using Design Expert Software (version 8.0. 6). Three numeric parameters viz., amount of adsorbent, initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH and one categoric factor viz., type of adsorbent (<b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algal biomass) were selected as input factors and percentage removal of Cu(II) as response. From kinetic study {{in both the}} cases it is seen {{that the size of}} algal adsorbent has negligible effect on the removal of Cu(II) under the ranges (53 – 125  µ) studied. Therefore, during optimization of removal process, adsorbent size was not selected as input parameters. Furthermore, kinetic study reveals that the percentage removal of Cu(II) has reached to its equilibrium value within 20  min. Thus, run time has been fixed to 30  min during optimization study. Factors of optimization process were maintained according to the design made by the software. Residual concentration of Cu(II) was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 460  nm. The maximum (+ 1) and minimum levels (− 1) of three input factors viz., initial Cu(II) concentration, adsorbent dose and solution pH were 50 and 20  mg/L, 0.25 and 0.1  g and 6 and 4, respectively. The volume of solution was kept 50  mL in each of the experimental run during optimization study.|$|R
30|$|To {{establish}} {{the mechanism of}} Cu(II) removal using algal adsorbents, kinetic study was done. A stock solution of Cu(II) (1000  mg/L) was prepared by dissolving definite amount of CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O (AR grade, MERCK) in distilled water. Various concentrations of Cu(II) were prepared from the stock solution by diluting it with suitable amount of distilled water. Pre-weighted adsorbents (<b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized)</b> prepared from algal biomass were added separately to each flask containing 50  mL of metal solution and agitated in a BOD incubator with shaker (Make Digitech, India) at 35  ±  1  °C. Initially experiments were conducted for 60  min; however, no remarkable change in concentration was observed after 20  min. Therefore, during kinetic study, all the experiments were run for 20  min only. To assess Cu(II) removal, samples were collected at different time intervals. The solutions were then centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 10  min and supernatant was analyzed for Cu(II) concentration spectrophotometrically using UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (TECHCOM, UV 2300) at 460  nm (Greenberg et al. 1992). Sorption kinetics of Cu(II) by <b>dried</b> biomass <b>and</b> its <b>carbonized</b> form has been studied by varying three operating parameters viz., initial Cu(II) concentration (10 – 50  mg/L), solution pH (2 – 6) and adsorbent dose in a judicial manner. Sorption of Cu(II) is highly dependent on adsorbent dose. Initially sorption of Cu(II) was examined with different amount of <b>dried</b> biomass <b>and</b> its <b>carbonized</b> form separately <b>and</b> found that 0.5  g of carbonized biomass had similar capacity as that obtained with 1.0  g of dried biomass under identical condition. Therefore, during kinetic study, doses of <b>dried</b> algal biomass <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass were varied individually from 0.1 to 1.0  g and from 0.1 to 0.5  g, respectively, and all other parameters were kept constant.|$|R
30|$|The {{kinetics}} of adsorption {{describes the}} rate of Cu(II) uptake from aqueous solution. It has been observed that removal of Cu(II) by algal adsorbents involves two phases: a relatively fast phase (2  min) followed by a slow step that extends until the equilibrium was reached. Major removal has been achieved within 2  min of contact time and after 20  min, plateau region i.e., little variation in concentration of Cu(II) with time is observed. Thus, {{it can be said}} that equilibrium is reached in 20  min. It has also been found that Cu(II) can be removed maximum about 87.99 and 99.15  % with initial Cu(II) concentration of 10 and 25  mg/L for <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algae, respectively, at an adsorbent dose of 10  g/L in 20  min of contact time and at optimum pH 6 in both the cases.|$|R
30|$|Adsorption {{process is}} {{recognized}} as an effective and economic method for the abatement of heavy metals from wastewater (Fu and Wang 2011). Using microorganisms as sorbent is a new and very promising technology for wastewater treatment. The major advantages of biosorption over conventional methods are low cost, minimization of sludge, highly efficient at low metal ion concentration and regeneration of biosorbent. Biosorption occurs by physicochemical interaction between the cell surface and metal ions and hence reported as metabolically independent mechanism while bioaccumulation is metabolically dependent mechanism (Flouty and Estephane 2012). Bacteria, fungi, yeast and algae are potential metal biosorbent and among these the cyanobacterial populations have been found as more promising due to their simple nutrient requirements, larger biomass production and generally non-toxic and eco-friendly nature (Kiran and Kaushik 2008). Phycoremediation of heavy metals is an emerging technology in which macroalgae or microalgae are used to remove or transform the pollutants. Algae have high metal binding capabilities due {{to the presence of}} negative charges on the surface of their cell walls (Pittman et al. 2011). <b>Dried</b> algal biomass <b>and</b> its activated carbon are used for passive uptake of heavy metals while living cells take part actively in biosorption and bioaccumulation processes. As maintenance of living alga at higher metal ion concentration is a challenging job, the present study deals with biosorption using <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> algal biomass. The efficiency of this process is dependent on different parameters viz., metal ion concentration, adsorbent dose, adsorbent size and solution pH (Das et al. 2008). Hence, optimization of these process parameters is mandatory from proper bioreactor operation perspectives. The conventional technique for the optimization of a multivariable system usually defines one factor at a time (Sahu et al. 2009). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) can be used to overcome the problems associated with the conventional method for optimization of removal of Cu(II). RSM is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques useful for developing, improving and optimizing processes (Silva et al. 2004; Ravikumar et al. 2006, 2007; Karacan et al. 2007). Though {{a number of studies have}} been done to optimize chemical processes using RSM, its application in the field of phycoremediation using two different forms of algae (<b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized)</b> is probably a novel approach.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of microporous carbon foams from renewable starch microcellular foam-fiber (SMCF-Fiber) composites is described. Carbon foams {{are used in}} applications such as thermal insulation, battery electrodes, filters, fuel cells, and medical devices. SMCF-Fiber compos-ites were created from an aquagel. The water in the aquagel was exchanged with ethanol <b>and</b> then <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized.</b> Higher amylose content starches and fiber contents of up to 4 % improved the processability of the foam. The SMCF structure revealed agglomerates of swollen starch granules connected by a web of starch with pores in the 50 - 200 nanometer range. Heating the SMCF-fiber {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} to temperatures between 350 - 700 ˚C produced carbon foams with a three-dimensional closed cell foam structure with cell diameters around 50 microns and pore walls around 1 - 3 microns. The stress versus strain compression data for carbonized samples displayed a linear elastic region and a plateau indicative of brittle crushing, typical of an elastic-brittle foam. The carbon foam products from these renew-able precursors are promising carbon structures with moderate strength and low density...|$|R

40|$|Pig farming {{produces}} more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution {{for dealing with}} manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project "BioEcoSIM". Phosphate salts ("P-Salt") were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus an d potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{preparation}} of composite adsorbents for fluoride anion was performed from natural cow dung and cow dung impregnated by {{a solution of}} calcium and iron salts. These starting materials were <b>dried</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> at 300, 500 or 700 °C for 2 h leading to Cow Dung Carbon (CDC) or Ca–Fe Impregnated Cow Dung Carbon ICDC. All these carbons were used as adsorbent in fluoride removal studies. Batch mode experiments using CDC and ICDC were conducted in which the fluoride removal varied linearly {{as a function of}} contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, initial fluoride concentration, temperature and interfering anionic species. Both kinetic and isotherm based models were checked for the applicability of the present fluoride sorption system onto CDC and ICDC. For carbonization at 300 °C, the doping with Ca and Fe increased the defluoridation activity. The most efficient carbon was CDC which was prepared at 500 °C. It showed a defluoridation activity of 15 mgg− 1. This carbon was made from renewable cow dung without the need of a chemical activation. However, the recycling of F-loaded adsorbents may be carried out by washing in alkaline solution. CDC and ICDC were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction {{in order to understand the}} reasons of their excellent defluoridation capacity. The growing of plants requires the consumption of essential inorganic nutrients such as Ca, Mg, and P which are known to be fluorophilic elements in fluoride adsorbents. After ingestion and digestion of plants by ruminants, some of these nutrients remained in cow dung and then in the corresponding carbonized materials where they acted as fluoride scavenger. This exceptional defluoridation capacity of CDC allows their use in rural countries...|$|R
40|$|A new porous carbon {{material}} {{has been developed}} utilizing a natural porous structure of rice bran. The original porous {{carbon material}} (rice bran carbon, RBC) are manufactured by mixing the defatted rice bran with a phenol resin, pressure forming, <b>drying,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>carbonizing</b> at 900 °C. Therefore, the RBC has a porous structure. In this study, the authors investigated new manufacturing processes to strengthen the RBC. As a preliminary, the RB carbon particles are manufactured impregnating a phenol resin (25 wt. %) with the defatted rice bran <b>and</b> <b>carbonizing</b> at 900 °C. In the first strengthening process, the mixture of the carbonized RB carbon particles and a phenol resin are then pressure formed to make a disk-shape RB carbon (CRB). Since the RB carbon particles are brittle and therefore they are broken during the pressure forming, the pore size can be smaller in the CRB than in the RBC. In the second strengthening process, the mixture is injection molded to make a rectangular RB carbon (IMCRB). The pore size is also smaller in the IMCRB. The compressive strength, bending strength and fracture toughness are increased in the both strengthened materials...|$|R
30|$|Desorption {{study has}} been {{performed}} with 0.1  M HCl. Three successive cycles of sorption and desorption have been performed in a batch contactor. Adsorption capacity has been found as follows: first cycle, 3.94  mg/g; second cycle, 3.74  mg/g; third cycle, 3.59  mg/g with <b>dried</b> alga <b>and</b> first cycle, 4.09  mg/g; second cycle, 3.68  mg/g; third cycle, 3.3  mg/g with carbonized biomass. By comparing the adsorption capacity of <b>dried</b> biomass <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> biomass, {{it can be concluded}} that adsorption capacity of dried alga is higher than carbonized alga in successive sorption/desorption cycle, this result is in conformity with the Langmuir adsorption capacity. However, more than 80  % carbonized biomass has been regenerated {{at the end of the}} 3 rd cycle while 70  % regeneration has been seen with dried alga. From the present observation, one may expect better regeneration capability of carbonized biomass than that of dried algal biomass; however, it is not the true scenario. Since adsorption of Cu(II) is more with dried alga than that of carbonized alga, the total desorbed amount of Cu(II) is comparable with both the adsorbent.|$|R

Therefore, the RHS carbon {{is expected to be a}} high water-resistant material. In this study, the authors measure the compressive strength of the RHS carbon after water immersing and hygroscopic expansion in a deionized water. The compressive strength did not decrease after the water immersing. Moreover, the hygroscopic expansion of the RHS carbon was considerably low.

It {{was found that}} Rhodamine B adsorption reached equilibrium stage at 5, 7, 10 and 10  min for dye concentration 10, 20, 30 and 40  mg L− 1, respectively, while crystal violet (CV) {{was found to have}} equilibrium time of 40  min for all the concentrations. The adsorption capacity was found to be 2.56 and 8.06  mg g− 1 of adsorbent for Rhodamine B and Acid violet, respectively. Coir pith has also been investigated as an adsorbent by Kavitha and Namasivayam (2007) for the removal of Procion Orange from wastewater. The sorption capacity of 2.6  mg g− 1 makes it an adsorbent of little importance for dye removal from wastewater. Banana stalks were studied as adsorbents by Hameed et al. (2008 b) for basic dyes in aqueous solutions with equilibrium isotherms and kinetic adsorptions. High adsorption capacity of 243.90  mg g− 1 was observed and authors suggested that banana stalks consists of cellulose and lignin; it is the polyol structure of cellulose-based materials that has relatively strong chemical adsorption of cations such as metal ions and organic bases as well as physical adsorption of other material such as acidic and anionic compounds.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{adsorbent}} carbon monolith {{has been}} developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The monolith is fabricated from isotropic-pitch-derived carbon fibers and powdered phenolic resin via a slurry molding process. The resultant green-form is <b>dried,</b> cured, <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> to convert the phenolic resin to carbon, and then activated to develop a connected network of micropores within the carbon fibers and resin-derived carbon binder. The monolith is also macroporous, exhibiting large (> 50 µm) pores between the fibers. The resultant open structure allows {{the free flow of}} fluids through the monoliths such that gases can reach the micropores where they may be selectively adsorbed. This novel adsorbent has been named a “carbon fiber composite molecular sieve” (CFCMS). Several separations have been demonstrated such as the separation of hydrogen from experimental gas mixtures containing H 2 and H 2 S or H 2 and CO 2; the separation of CO 2 from CH 4; the separation of CO 2 from air; and the separation of CO 2, CO, H 2 S, and H 2 O from a variety of proprietary gas mixtures. The CFCMS is being investigated as a CO 2 separation and capture device in carbon mitigation strategies for natural gas processing, fuel cells, and gas turbines. The monolithic material is rigid and strong, resistant to attrition and dusting, and because of its continuous carbon skeletal structure, electrically conductive. An adsorbed gas may be quickly and efficiently desorbed by the passage of an electric current, thereby allowing for a low-energy, electrical-swing separation system. It is possible to regenerate the carbon monoliths {{in the absence of a}} temperature increase, potentially reducing swing cycle times and improving separation efficiency. The structure and properties of the adsorbent CFCMS monoliths are reported. Some information on the experimental apparatus is provided.

50|$|Antimony pentachloride is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula SbCl5. It is a colourless oil, but typical samples are yellowish due to impurities. Owing to its tendency to hydrolyse to hydrochloric acid, SbCl5 {{is a highly}} corrosive substance <b>and</b> <b>carbonizes</b> non-fluorinated plastics.|$|R

Results and analyses of the investigations conducted on the coal reserves are presented in detail. This report includes tables, maps, illustrations, and photographs...|$|R
40|$|A {{repeated}} impregnation and {{carbonization process}} {{was performed to}} prepare high-density woodceramics using MDF. The physical properties were estimated to further confirm morphologically structurally occurred changes of one-time and two-time phenolic resin treated <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> woodceramics. As compare one-time <b>and</b> two-time <b>carbonized</b> woodceramics, the increasing rate of weight and density declined after second carbonization as the resin impregnation ratio grew higher, and when the resin impregnation ratio was 40 percent, the weight and density of the second carbonization increased {{more than in the}} first step by 20. 5 % and 33. 9 % respectively which were the highest rates...|$|R
50|$|Heat is {{supplied}} for pyrolysis and air {{is supplied}} for oxidation. Depending on the procedure, pyrolysis and oxidation {{can be applied}} consecutively or simultaneously. During thermal cleaning, organic material is converted into volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> gas. Inorganic elements remain. Typical process temperatures range between 750 °F to 1000 °F (400 °C to 540 °C).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and lowest}} sedimentary deposits are fluvial, {{formed by the}} layering of clays, sandstones, pebbles and cobbles washed downstream by flowing rivers. The deposits are marked by mollusks, ostracods <b>and</b> <b>carbonized</b> plant parts, <b>and</b> demonstrate alternating passage of river channels or meandering streams. The lowest deposits are marked {{by a series of}} volcanic ash layers.|$|R
50|$|According to Heller's {{and other}} {{contemporary}} descriptions, urostealith is a soft brown substance, insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol and easily soluble in ether. Upon heating it softens at first, then expands <b>and</b> <b>carbonizes</b> before melting. It dissolves in solutions of sodium carbonate, {{and the latter}} was successfully used by Heller to dissolve and break up stones in a patient's bladder.|$|R
