The group are forced to kill the transformed Cherenkov before escaping on the Elsa and being rescued by Jr.. During the subsequent battle, KOS-MOS activates previously-unseen weaponry and absorbs the attacking Gnosis. While traveling with Jr., the group learn that the Kukai Foundation are gathering and storing the Zohar Emulators created by Mizrahi. Meanwhile, U-TIC uses agents within the Federation to doctor footage of Jr.'s battle with U-TIC and implicate the group {{in the destruction of}} the Woglinde. The group travel to the Kukai <b>Foundation</b> <b>base</b> above Second Miltia, operated by Jr.'s brother Gaignun. They are subsequently held hostage by Federation troops due to U-TIC's influence. With help from an ally of Gaignun, the group retrieve evidence from within KOS-MOS's memory center which can exonerate them.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{exterior of}} Manjakamiadana comprised over 70,000granite stones, of which approximately 20,000 had become cracked during {{the fire and}} needed replacement. The western wall of the palace partially collapsed in January 2004 and required complete rebuilding. [...] Every stone was removed and numbered to facilitate the reinsertion of each one in its original place with two French stone-masonry companies engaged to supervise the work. The foundation was modernised, first using laser technology to assess the topography of the site, then by driving 22cement piles into the ground beneath the <b>foundation</b> <b>base</b> {{to a depth of}} [...] Phase2 consisted of replacing each of the numbered exterior wall stones in its original place, bolstered where needed by new stones to replace those damaged in the fire. Although the palace interior was originally made of wood, the reconstructed building was designed using reinforced concrete interior supporting beams for the walls, ceiling and roof due to concerns over the availability and durability of hardwood. Finally, the roof was re-tiled in blue-gray slate imported from quarries near the French city of Angers.|$|E

50|$|In 1931, {{following}} many {{observations and}} detailed investigations, work therefore began on an initial {{reconstruction of the}} viaduct. The work {{was carried out by}} the firm B. & C. Caprez. During that work, the valley side abutment was underpinned by a bell-shaped concrete block, which was clad with Hunziker stones, and reinforced with rails. The block had a diameter of 14 m and a height of 9 m. Additionally, a new <b>foundation</b> <b>base</b> was laid some 21 m below the previous ground level.|$|E
50|$|Following the Battle of Sekigahara, in 1601, {{the area}} was visited by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who renamed “Mount Aoba” as “Sendai”. The first daimyo of Sendai Domain, Date Masamune began {{construction}} of the castle with the central bailey and San-no-Maru bailey {{at the base of}} the hill. Plans for the tenshu, equivalent to the main keep of European castles, were drawn, but only the <b>foundation</b> <b>base</b> was ever built. Work on the castle, including the San-no-Maru bailey and numerous gates was completed by Date Tadamune in 1637.|$|E

The innermost bailey would normally contain a donjon; however there is considerable dispute {{as to whether or}} not it actually ever did. Records indicate that a stone <b>foundation</b> <b>base</b> existed from at least 1627, but the Tokugawa government never authorized the construction of a donjon tower. The present donjon is a modern reconstruction based on artists assumptions on what a Keichō period (1596-1615) donjon should look like.|$|E

Analyzing these types of structures requires specialized explicit finite element computer code, which divides time into very small slices and models the actual physics, much like common video games often have [...] "physics engines". Very large and complex buildings can be modeled in this way (such as the Osaka International Convention Center).|$|E
50|$|The church {{consists}} of a Late Romanesque apse, chancel and nave and a Gothic tower and porch, all built of brick. Pilaster strips decorate {{the corners of the}} nave and chancel. The apse and chancel have a rounded <b>foundation</b> <b>base.</b> There is a three-sided wall at the east end of the apse while there are round-arched windows in the side walls. The toothed cornice is decorated a saw-toothed trimming which runs along pilasters to the chancel gabel. The nave walls are similarly decorated with cornices and pilasters. The chancel windows resemble those of the apse but they have been extended downwards.|$|E
50|$|In linguistics, a {{hypostasis}} (from the Greek word ὑπόστασις meaning <b>foundation,</b> <b>base</b> or {{that which}} stands behind), {{is a relationship}} between a name and a known quantity, as a cultural personification (i.e. objectification with personality) of an entity or quality. It often connotes the personification of typically elemental powers, such as wind and fire, or human life, fertility, and death. In descriptive linguistics, the term was first introduced by Leonard Bloomfield to account for uses of synsemantic words as autosemantic in sentences such as Im tired of your ifs and buts. In this sense, the usage {{meaning of the word}} is referred to as a whole.|$|E
