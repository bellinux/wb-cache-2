50|$|<b>Joged</b> is a {{style of}} dance from the Island of Bali. The term <b>Joged</b> or Joget is also a common word for dance in Indonesia.

Balinese <b>Joged</b> dance is not a religious and ritual one, it is social dance for entertainment purposes only. During a <b>Joged</b> performance, a single or several female dancers will perform and invited male audience to dance with them. The dance often involving erotic movements and teasing, ranged from humorous to seducement interactions between the dancers with their male counterpart. The dance is quite comparable with other Indonesian dance traditions; {{such as those of}} Javanese Ronggeng and Sundanese Jaipongan.|$|R

40|$|A {{modification}} of the jogged-screw model has been adopted recently by the authors to explain observations of 1 / 2 [110]-type jogged-screw dislocations in equiaxed Ti- 48 Al under creep conditions. The {{aim of this study}} has been to verify and validate the parameters and functional dependencies that have been assumed in this previous work. The original solution has been reformulated {{to take into account the}} finite length of the moving <b>jog.</b> This is a better approximation of the tall <b>jog.</b> The substructural model parameters have been further investigated in light of the Finite Length Moving Line (FLML) source approximation. The original model assumes that the critical <b>jog</b> height (beyond which the <b>jog</b> is not dragged) is inversely proportional to the applied stress. By accounting for the fact that there are three competing mechanisms (<b>jog</b> dragging, dipole dragging, dipole bypass) possible, we can arrive at a modified critical <b>jog</b> height. The critical <b>jog</b> height was found to be more strongly stress dependent than assumed previously. The original model assumes the <b>jog</b> spacing to be invariant over the stress range. However, dynamic simulation using a line tension model has shown that the <b>jog</b> spacing is inversely proportional to the applied stress. This has also been confirmed by TEM measurements of <b>jog</b> spacings over a range of stresses. Taylor's expression assumed previously to provide the dependence of dislocation density on the applied stress, has now been confirmed by actual dislocation density measurements. Combining all of these parameters and dependencies, derived both from experiment and theory, leads to an excellent prediction of creep rates and stress exponents. The further application of this model to other materials, and the important role of atomistic and dislocation dynamics simulations in its continued development is also discussed...|$|R
5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking it seriously, instead of simply <b>jogging</b> in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E
