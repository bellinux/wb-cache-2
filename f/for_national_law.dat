5000|$|In Case E-5/15, Matja Kumba, the {{national}} court asked, firstly, whether an average weekly working time of 84 hours (7-7 rotation) in a cohabitant care arrangement constitutes {{a breach of}} Article 6 of the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC); secondly, whether a national provision, under which an employee’s consent to working more than 60 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement cannot be revoked, {{is compatible with the}} rights that employees have under the Directive; and thirdly, whether a dismissal following a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment” within the meaning of the Directive. With regard to the first question, the Court noted that it is for {{the national}} court to assess the amount of working time in the case at hand, taking into account the factors clarified by the Court. Working time amounting to an average of 84 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement is compatible with Article 6 of the Directive, in circumstances governed by Article 22(1)(a), provided that the worker has explicitly, freely and individually agreed to perform such work, and the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of the worker are observed. With regard to the second question, the Court noted that the Directive does not contain a provision concerning revocation of consent. It is <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> to determine whether such revocation of consent is possible. However, a complete inability to revoke consent, even in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, may prove incompatible with the Directive, since the possibility for a worker to consent to exceeding the maximum weekly working time is expressly conditional on the EEA State respecting the general principles of the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers, cf. Article 22(1)(a) of the Directive. With regard to the third question, the Court noted that, typically, a dismissal due to a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment”. However, a notice of dismissal and offer of re-engagement on new terms, following a refusal by a worker to agree to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, is not to be considered a “detriment” if the termination of the employment is based upon reasons that are fully independent of the worker’s refusal to agree to perform such additional work.|$|E

5000|$|Monists {{accept that}} the {{internal}} and international legal systems form a unity. Both national legal rules and international rules that a state has accepted, for example {{by way of a}} treaty, determine whether actions are legal or illegal. In most so-called [...] "monist" [...] states, a distinction between international law in the form of treaties, and other international law, e.g., customary international law or jus cogens, is made; such states may thus be partly monist and partly dualist. In a pure monist state, international law {{does not need to be}} translated into national law. It is just incorporated and has effect automatically in national or domestic laws. The act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates the law into national law; and customary international law is treated as part of national law as well. International law can be directly applied by a national judge, and can be directly invoked by citizens, just as if it were national law. A judge can declare a national rule invalid if it contradicts international rules because, in some states, the latter have priority. In other states, like in Germany, treaties have the same effect as legislation, and by the principle of Lex posterior derogat priori ("Later law removes the earlier"), only take precedence over national legislation enacted prior to their ratification. In its most pure form, monism dictates that national law that contradicts international law is null and void, even if it post-dates international law, and even if it is constitutional in nature.From a human rights point of view, for example, this has some advantages. Suppose a country has accepted a human rights treaty - the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for instance - but some of its national laws limit the freedom of the press. A citizen of that country, who is being prosecuted by his state for violating this national law, can invoke the human rights treaty in a national courtroom and can ask the judge to apply this treaty and to decide that the national law is invalid. He or she does not have to wait <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that translates international law. His or her government can, after all, be negligent or even unwilling to translate. The treaty was perhaps only accepted for political reasons, in order to please donor-countries for example.|$|E

There are also parallels between factors in Anglo-American fair use and fair dealing legislation and the three step test.

40|$|Private law is {{increasingly}} influenced by international law, in particular by EU law. EU law prohibits, for example, {{the use of}} a cartel and awards consumers a special form of protection, for example against the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts or against door-to-door selling. It is in principle <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> to decide whether rules of EU law are applied in a national civil proceeding.

After all, if such rules are not tested, EU Member States could, by adopting restrictive rules, limit the effectiveness of EU law in too large a manner. A national civil procedure needs to awards the parties an effective remedy in court. That is the first test. All national rules need to meet the demands of the principles of effectiveness and equality. That is the second test.

40|$|The {{question}} asked {{in this thesis}} is: what is {{the impact on the}} democratic legitimacy of the legal orders of the member states of the EU, where the meaning of EU fundamental rights is determined by the Court of Justice of the EU. It begins by developing a theoretical framework which reconstructs the deep structure of the law of the member states, {{in order to understand the}} ground of legitimacy <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> It concludes that the legitimacy of national law is tied to the democratic processes through which those subject to the law can contest the authority of that law. Human rights are the institutional mechanisms which make that contestation possible. Human Rights therefore are conditions of democracy. Further, human rights are legal norms which themselves are the subject of disagreement, therefore they need to be elaborated through democratic processes. The thesis argues that the European Convention on Human Rights ‘fits’ this understanding of human rights - the Convention and the ECtHR are best conceived as subsidiary supervisory mechanisms by which all the states which are parties to the Convention support each other in the observance of rights which form part of the deep structure of their own domestic laws, and which are the conditions for the democratic nature of their national legal orders. The thesis then uses that theoretical framework as a normative standards in order to conducts an assessment of the demands that the EU makes of the member states in respect of fundamental rights. It focuses on three aspects of the EU fundamental rights practice - the point of EU fundamental rights, the foundations of EU fundamental rights, and the citizen of the EU, as a bearer of rights. It observes that there are important differences between national human rights and EU fundamental rights in all three aspects. The thesis concludes that the demands which EU fundamental rights place on member states have the potential to undermine the ability of the member states legal orders to claim democratic legitimacy...|$|E

40|$|In {{looking at}} the {{collection}} of papers in this volume, an impression of a certain eclecticism cannot be avoided. We have articles on public international law, European human-rights law, legal history, and various aspects of Estonian law, but also, for example, issues in Ukrainian law are dealt with. Moreover, {{while most of the}} articles are in English, some key papers are in German, which in times gone by was the lingua franca of the Baltic intellectual universe. Although the substantive themes of this edition of Juridica International are inevitably varied, it seems to me nevertheless that the diverse legal domains and questions all are connected with the expectations that we as lawyers and citizens have for law – be it international, regional, or domestic. Christian Tomuschat’s programmatic article on the current state and future of public international law is connected with a festive event that we celebrated at our university on 1 December 2016, when Professor Tomuschat received an honorary doctorate from the University of Tartu. In this capacity, he has joined the ranks of other distinguished individuals who have become honorary doctors in the field of law here: Boris Meissner (1996), Heinrich Mark (1998), Peter Schlechtriem and Thomas Wilhelmsson (2002), Wilfried Schlüter (2003), Tarja Halonen (2004), Christian von Bar (2007), Werner Krawietz (2008), Erik Nerep (2011), and Joachim Rückert (2014). The question of international law’s future is inevitably linked to the expectations we hold for that law. Professor Tomuschat demonstrates how international law became universal and how this has influenced expectations of it. Of course, the higher the expectations are, the easier it is to fall short of them. When the case load of the European Court of Human Rights became too heavy on occasion, some people said that the Court had become a victim of its own success. In this issue, Judge Julia Laffranque reflects on ethical foundations of, and expectations for, European human-rights law and its interpretations. Legal history, in turn, reminds us that the issue of expectations of law is an age-old one. Ideas from natural law have lived in an uneasy relationship with pure legal positivism. Especially in dictatorships, law does not correspond to ethical standards characteristic of democracies. In some cases, law has even become a tool of outright repression. The Radbruch Formula, known from the history of legal debate in Germany, has not lost its topicality. What are the expectations <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law?</b> We usually expect best practices and legal models – to the extent that these can be established – to be followed. We expect legal certainty and a certain rationality and logic behind the law. Yet law can be likened to Estonia’s capital city, Tallinn, which according to an ancient legend will never be ‘ready’: it can never be complete. Expectations for law are particularly high in countries in transition, such as Ukraine. The University of Tartu (formerly Dorpat) had important links to universities in Ukraine already in the 19 th century, and now we keep our fingers crossed that Ukraine will be able to pursue its own strong statehood based on democratic values. What are the expectations for legal scholarship? Since the readers of legal writings are educated in jurisprudence, we all expect to become more enlightened, to find clarification for things that we were not aware of or that we knew less about. If this volume of Juridica International succeeds with that in its readers’ eyes, it has done well enough...|$|E

Standardization is defined as best technical application consensual wisdom inclusive of processes for selection in making appropriate choices for ratification coupled with consistent decisions for maintaining obtained standards. The standards applicable to each sector of the environment. When the European Community sets standards for environmental protection, these do not prevent the “progressive” member states from maintaining or introducing more stringent environmental protection measures. Even if the European Community has adopted protective measures, i. e. set certain environmental standards pursuant to Standardization or standardisation {{is the process of}} developing and agreeing upon technical standards. A standard is a document that establishes uniform engineering or technical specifications, criteria, methods, processes, or practices. Some standards are mandatory while others are voluntary. Voluntary standards are available if one chooses to use them. Some are de facto standards, meaning a norm or requirement which has an informal but dominant status. Some standards are de jure, meaning formal legal requirements. Formal standards organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the American National Standards Institute, are independent of the manufacturers of the goods for which they publish standards. The goals of standardization can be to help with independence of single suppliers (commoditization), compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality. In social sciences, including economics, the idea of standardization is close to the solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. Standardization is defined as best technical application consentual wisdom inclusive of processes for selection in making appropriate choices for ratification coupled with consistent decisions for maintaining obtained standards. The ISO 14000 is a standard for environmental management systems that is applicable to any business, regardless of size, location or income. The aim of the standard is to reduce the environmental footprint of a business and to decrease the pollution and waste a business produces. The most recent version of ISO 14001 was released in 2004 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which has representation from committees all over the world. The ISO 14000 environmental management standards exist to help organizations minimize how their operations negatively affect the environment. Environmental standards is a set of quality conditions that are to be adhared or maintained for a particular environmental component and function. the different environmental activities have different concerns and therefore different standards. The text provides a general overview of why and how the international system elaborates environmental obligations and monitors compliance with them. Second, it discusses the relationship between international obligations and national and local law, with particular reference to federal systems. It indicates another interrelationship, pointing out the influence national law has on the emergence of international law as well as the growing role of international norms in the development and enforcement of national and local environmental policies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} topic of compensating losses caused by infringements of EU competition law. In particular, {{the focus is on}} the relationship and on the “mixture” of EU and national law in that context. The topic is dealt with by studying, on the one hand, EU law and, on the other hand, Finnish law as a national legal order. The main method is the theoretical legal dogmatic method but some parts (for instance, Sections II–III and VII) are also characterized by the interpretive or practical legal dogmatic method. Additionally, law and economics and law and language approaches have had some impact on the work. In the absence of material EU rules on the matter, it is for national legal orders to provide remedies and procedures for safeguarding the rights conferred on individuals by EU law. This is, somewhat misleadingly, also called the procedural autonomy of the Member States. National law fills in the gaps left by EU law so that, for instance, the law applicable to a dispute involving damages claims related to infringements of EU rights is a mixture of EU law and national law. In addition to being a combination of material rules of different legal orders, the mixture is complicated by the fact that even when national rules apply, it may be necessary to adapt them to meet the requirements set by EU law. Regarding reacting to infringements of EU law in areas of law where the EU legal order does not legislate the means of reacting and procedures for doing so exhaustively – which is very often the case – it is not possible to easily discern the applicable material rules and their meaning. Instead of being a clear set of stable rules, the law applicable to compensating losses caused by infringements of EU competition law is a dynamic mass of principles and rules of both the EU and national legal orders. It can be noted in both European and Finnish legal discussion that great inability arises in pointing out the applicable rules of law and their meaning. For this reason, discussion and assumptions on the content of applicable rules are vague. Furthermore, statements made on the meaning of applicable law without paying attention to the conundrum of concurrent norms and principles of EU and national law may be incorrect. This dissertation aims to find a way or a model for structuring and discerning the applicable pieces of law, and finally: the content and meaning of law in a situation where damages are claimed (in Finland) in the context of infringements of EU competition law. To achieve this goal, EU requirements <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> that safeguards EU rights and regulates reactions to infringements of those rights is studied closely. Central issues for this work include so-called procedural autonomy case-law and other EU law on the interaction of EU law with national legal orders, and how all this is to be seen in the context of competition law infringements. In addition to principles and requirements of EU law, relevant material rules on damages must also be and are taken into account as a part of the whole of the relevant EU law. Moreover, because EU principles and requirements are content- or result-oriented, material national rules are studied in order to see how the combination of EU and national law is actually formed. Regarding the requirements that EU law sets <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> it is of importance that the issue whether something exists that should be regarded as an EU right to damages under competition law, which would be subject to the EU requirements applicable to (upholding or maintaining) EU rights as defined in EU law, can be considered obscure. For instance, a plenitude of legal discussion is available that mentions the right to damages in this context and thus departs, either knowingly or not, from a rational starting point that damages actions or compensation should be regarded as something that is subject to the EU requirements that relate to remedies in situations where an EU right is infringed. The question as to under which EU law requirements the issue of competition infringement damages should be dealt with is a central one, since an alleged “right to damages under competition law” should, in national courts, be upheld as it appears in EU law – which might necessitate disapplying a great amount of national law. Moreover, the task of upholding would be quite challenging, since significant parts of such a “right” are not yet visible in EU law. If the EU requirements on remedies and procedural autonomy principles that regulate reacting to infringements of EU rights were to apply to compensating damages related to competition infringements, that is, if damages were to be considered a mere remedy from the point of view of EU requirements, there could also be some variation in deciding relevant competition infringement-related cases in national courts. National law could be applied as long as it were not contradictory in relation to the few material rules discernible in EU (case-) law and as long as national law were in accordance with the EU law requirements – in the context of remedies: principles of equality, effectiveness and of adequate judicial protection. In this dissertation, the issue whether the requirements for upholding EU rights or the requirements relating traditionally to (reactive or reparatory) remedies apply to damages under EU competition law is studied by analyzing the relevant concepts and requirements in EU case-law. Even though the concept of rights and their relationship to remedies are unclear issues in EU law, it is submitted that damages under EU competition law are to be evaluated according to the requirements applicable to remedies. Moreover, in competition infringement situations, the EU right that must be upheld is not that of damages but a right to a competitive and undistorted Internal Market. It is argued that the “rights language” of the Court of Justice of the EU in the context of competition infringement damages does not refer to a particular right to damages but represents standard language (not a particular legal definition) or refers to the above-mentioned right to competitive markets. The model for structuring and discerning the applicable law in competition infringement damages cases is constructed by distinguishing between EU law requirements for rights, (reactive or reparatory) remedies, and procedural rules, and viewing damages for competition infringements as a (reactive or reparatory) remedy. On the basis of the analysis, it is submitted that each sub-issue of a damages claim case, such as a condition for reparation (e. g., causal link), should be evaluated by first surveying the possibly applicable material EU law rules (both in the specific context of competition infringement damages and more broadly), and then analyzing the compatibility of national rules with the material rules. After this one should continue by surveying the discernible significance of the relevant EU law requirements in the context of that particular sub-issue, and then analyzing what the EU law requirements mean in the context of relevant and (taking into account the material EU rules) still eligible national rules, assessing whether the rules may be applied as such and whether, for instance, it is necessary to interpret them in a certain way to fulfill the requirements of EU law on remedies. The model for structuring and discerning the applicable law is applied for short and exemplary analyses of certain conditions for awarding damages, taking the reader through the relevant EU law and Finnish law as the model suggests. Conclusions of the research include the observation that structured and organized analysis of EU law and national law is possible and advisable in the context of competition infringement damages. Studying the combination of EU law and national law according to the model reveals that Finland’s, or any other Member State’s, law may be compatible with EU law also in such contexts where other descriptions of EU law and its requirements would have led to a different result. Requiring fault and law relating to it is an illustrative example of this. Regarding possible erroneous findings of incompatibility, also unnecessary adaption of national law “to suit the requirements of EU law” could constitute a problem in administration of justice, because it would lead to decisions that are not really based on law and which would, moreover, be problematic from the point of view of legal certainty. The applicable material rules and their contents vary over time but the basic principles for discerning the common meaning of EU and national law, as well as the fact that reacting to infringements of an EU right (to an undistorted Internal Market) is regulated by a combination of EU and national legal orders, are more permanent. The European Commission’s new (2013) proposal for a directive relating to competition infringement damages claims shows that many significant aspects of damages claims are going to be governed by national law and EU limits on national law – that is, a complex combination of EU law and national law – also in the future. Analysis based on a similar model as constructed in the dissertation is also likely to be useful, for instance, regarding other contexts where claims for damages are based on EU law in horizontal relationships. Suomenkielinen yleistajuinen tiivistelmä Väitöskirjassa tarkastellaan EU:n kilpailuoikeuden rikkomiseen liittyviin vahingonkorvausasioihin soveltuvaa oikeutta. EU:n kilpailuoikeuden vastaisia järjestelyjä ovat elinkeinonharjoittajien väliset kilpailua rajoittavat sopimukset, kuten kartellit, ja määräävän markkina-aseman väärinkäyttö. Lainvastaisista kilpailunrajoituksista voi aiheutua erilaisille tahoille vahinkoa muun muassa maksettuna ylihintana tai tulon menetyksenä. EU:n kilpailuoikeuden rikkomiseen liittyvät korvausvaatimukset käsitellään kansallisissa tuomioistuimissa, joiden on sovellettava tässä yhteydessä riitoihin EU-oikeuden ja kansallisen oikeuden yhdistelmää. EU:n kilpailuoikeus, EU-oikeuden tavoitteet ja periaatteet yhtäältä ja kansalliset oikeuskeinot, vahingonkorvausoikeus ja prosessioikeus toisaalta muodostavat monitahoisen ja epäkoherentin oikeusnormimassan. Sääntelykokonaisuus on paikoin jopa ristiriitainen ja monilta osin avoin. Kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen yksityiskohtiin soveltuvien normien löytäminen EU:n ja kansallisen normiston akselilta ei ole yksinkertaista. EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden välillä voidaan katsoa olevan epäselvä siirtymäalue, jolla kyse ei ole vain jommankumman normiston soveltumisesta, vaan paremminkin normistojen sekoitussuhteesta. EU-oikeuden vaikutustapojen ja vaatimusten merkityksen tunnistaminen on EU-oikeuden materiaalisten sääntöjen huomioon ottamisen ohella välttämätön edellytys sille, että kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen yhteydessä relevantin oikeuden sisällöstä voidaan perustellusti keskustella. Oikeustieteellisessä keskustelussa on ollut yleistä, ettei EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden keskinäissuhdetta ja siten myöskään yksityiskohtaista korvaukseen soveltuvaa oikeutta pystytä kuvaamaan perustellusti ja selvästi. Myös tuomioistuimilla voi olla vaikeuksia relevantin oikeuden hahmottamisessa. Väitöskirjassa esitetään EU:n ja Suomen oikeuden yhdessä muodostamaan kokonaisuuteen pureutuen, miten EU-oikeuden ja kansallisen oikeuden yhdistelmää olisi jäsennettävä, jotta lopullisia kansallisessa tuomioistuimessa vahingonkorvausasiaan soveltuvia normeja voitaisiin kuvata pätevästi. Tarkastelussa käytetyt metodit ovat erityisesti teoreettinen lainoppi ja lainoppi. Myös esimerkiksi oikeustaloustieteellisellä analyysillä ja oikeuden ja kielen analyysillä on työssä paikoin merkitystä. Tutkimuksessa syvennytään EU-oikeudesta, lähinnä oikeustapauksista, löytyviin materiaalisiin sääntöihin ja analysoidaan EU-oikeuden kansalliselle oikeudelle asettamia hyväksyttävyyden rajoja. Kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen kannalta relevanttia EU-oikeutta ja EU-oikeuden tarkoituksen asianmukaista toteuttamista tutkitaan ottamalla huomioon vahingonkorvauksen yleisempi asema EU-oikeudessa ja kansallisten tuomioistuinten voimakkaat velvollisuudet edistää EU-oikeuden tavoitteisiin pääsyä. Näin voidaan selvittää, miltä osin kansallinen oikeus voi yhä soveltua EU:n kilpailuoikeuteen perustuviin korvausvaatimuksiin ja miten kansallista oikeutta on tässä yhteydessä tulkittava. EU-oikeudellisen analyysin jälkeen väitöskirjassa toteutetaan esimerkinomaisia tarkasteluja EU:n ja Suomen oikeuden muodostamasta kokonaisuudesta kilpailuoikeudellisen vahingonkorvauksen maksamisen edellytysten yhteydessä. Tutkimuksen keskeisiin tuloksiin lukeutuu se, että EU-kilpailuoikeuteen liittyviin korvausvaatimuksiin sovellettavat kansalliset säännöt voivat ilmeisesti vaihdella EU:n jäsenvaltiosta toiseen joiltain osin enemmän kuin aiemmin on oletettu. Asianmukainen EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden raja-alueen tarkastelu edistää myös oikeusaukkojen paikantamista ja yksilöintiä. EU:n ja kansallisen oikeuden järjestelmällinen jäsentäminen on mahdollista ja suositeltavaa jäsenvaltioiden tuomioistuimissa käsiteltäviä EU-oikeuteen perustuvia vaatimuksia analysoitaessa...|$|E

40|$|This chapter aims {{to explore}} {{some of the}} major legal issues {{pertaining}} to transmission of digital assets on death. “Digital assets” within this chapter are defined widely and not exclusively to include a huge range of intangible information goods associated with the online or digital world: including social network profiles e. g. on Facebook, Twitter, Google + or Linked In; emails, tweets, databases etc; in-game virtual assets (e. g., as bought, found or built in worlds such as Second Life, World of Warcraft, Lineage, etc); digitised text, image, music or sound, such as video, film and e-book files; passwords to various accounts associated with provisions of digital goods and services, either as buyer, user or trader (e. g. to eBay, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube etc); domain names; 2 D or 3 D personality-related images or icons such as user icons on LiveJournal or avatars in Second Life; and not excluding the myriad types of digital assets emergent as commodities capable of being assigned worth (e. g. “zero day exploits” or bugs in software which antagonists can exploit[1]). In emerging legal discourse, disputes over digital assets on death can be usefully divided as related to either their pure economic value, or what might be called their dignitary, personal or non-economic value. Domain names, for example are an obvious example of an economic asset which may be crucial to the branding and thus the profitability of a business. In a family business, not only who inherits the domain name itself, but also who gets the email notifying of the upcoming need to re-register, may be controversial issues. Similarly many outlet businesses nowadays operate exclusively from eBay and, again, who inherits that account (i. e. the password and login), the money attached to the account, and any connected ongoing auctions will be a serious matter. Virtual assets in game worlds often represent the fruit of thousands of hours of labour (if game playing can be called labour[2]) and there is already a substantial ethical and legal literature around their value, sale and conditions for transferability[3]. Photos, blogs and text (e. g. spontaneous poems) within social network profiles by celebrities – or those who die and later become famous – are likely soon to be of economic value, just as author’s letters and unpublished novels[4]are today. But such assets may also be of what one might call sentimental value. Millions of photos exist on Flickr, Picasa, etc which are of very little value to anyone but the accountholder’s immediate friends and family – but to them they may be priceless. Similarly, access to the emails of a deceased family member may be of desperate importance to the bereaved, and this issue more than any has sparked public and legislative attention to the issue of digital assets, intermediary platforms and death (see below, sec. B, p. 6). Another crucial modern phenomenon is the trend towards “memorialisation” of social network profiles on Facebook and the like[5]; effectively turning them into shrines to the memory of the deceased, where friends leave last messages and other friends gather to read them. In such cases, although money is not (usually) the issue, emotions can run very high and conflicts develop (do the friends or the parents decide if the profile is memorialised? What if the profile tells people something about the deceased the parents would rather suppress e. g. homosexuality, atheism, suicide?) and the first litigation relating to access to, and possession of, social network profiles is also beginning to percolate through[6]. Finally {{it is worth noting that}} society in general as well as specific heirs, family and friends has an interest in the legacy of the dead; e. g. authors’ letters (or emails, or blogs) have value to historians, scholars and critics as well as a market value to collectors. The range of stakeholders involved in digital assets cases is thus disparate and by no means limited to those in a contractual relationship with service providers[7]. In all types of cases, the legal issues around access, control, ownership and transmission are complex, and worse still, such answers as there are may vary considerably from legal system to legal system. It is important to note the law does not start here from a blank canvas. To some extent, existing laws will already partially regulate the issues. Almost all legal systems have rules relating to the transmission of property on death, under the name of wills and testaments law, succession, probate etc. Succession law is usually divided into what the law says when a will has been made by the deceased (testacy) and what happens when no will exists (intestacy). The law regulating the procedure to wind up the deceased’s estate – the ingathering and distribution of assets to heirs or legatees – is a separate branch of law again, usually called executry or administration. Unhelpfully, succession laws tend to be very localised - e. g. the substantive laws relating to transmission of assets on death vary wildly even between, say, the various United States, England and Wales, and Scotland, which are at least all three common law jurisdictions (though Scotland has considerable civilian influence). Civilian legal systems (eg as found in the nations of Continental Europe, Latin America, Louisiana, Quebec and Japan) differ even further. These differences matter: in one system, the spouse of the deceased may inherit or have the right to occupy the family home no matter what a will says – in others, the will may reign triumphant. In some systems, step-children may inherit nothing on intestacy, while in others they may be equal to full-blood children. Some attempts have been made to harmonise a few aspects of succession law globally – e. g. as discussed below, the laws on recognition of grants of administration obtained abroad in relation to assets in the local jurisdiction – but very little of the basic substantive law has been globally harmonised. As we shall see later, this means difficult jurisdictional problems are likely to arise in the nature of digital assets, for example, if an English person dies in England but with a profile on Facebook, a company whose HQ is in California but whose servers may be distributed globally. We touch briefly on this issue at section E. The key question is how far digital assets fit well into these existing legal paradigms, complex as they are, and whether new law is needed. Two preliminary issues complicate the matter. First, in general, assets only fall into the estate of a deceased if they are “property”. Property law, like succession law, is a well-established and ancient branch of private law. It has also been annotated by more modern legal conceptions including intellectual property (IP) law, data protection (DP) law, privacy law and information law. Property is most often recognisable as to what transmits on death. It has restrictions. In most systems, not all things we may want, or think we own, are property, although where the line is drawn is one of the most difficult issues in private law. Some items cannot be owned as they belong to all of us: the air and the high seas are usually in this category. More relevantly to digital assets, some items are too evanescent to be property. The hope of a future gain – e. g. an option to buy future stock, held by an employee when they die – may or may not convert into an item in their probate inventory, depending on the legal system and the exact details. The same may apply to a future right to sue on behalf of the deceased if he or she was libelled or wronged or dismissed from employment without cause during their lifetime. In many legal systems, such claims are viewed as personal to the deceased and title to sue in such cases dies with the wronged person and will not transmit to their heirs. Some licences – contractual rights to use, as are commonly “sold” in relation to digital music or intellectual property (IP) in general – are explicitly given only for limited periods of time – which may mean they expire on death (or earlier) and so do not form part of the estate of the deceased. This point is very relevant to inheritance of MP 3 s downloaded from e. g. iTunes, or e-books downloaded to a Kindle. Finally, some assets are so novel it is simply hard to tell if they can be categorised as property, even if regularly “sold” or valued, and if so, what kind of property. The “zero day exploits” mentioned above may fall into this character, as might be on-line reputations e. g. the “karma” on Slashdot of a commenter, or a trader’s cumulative rating on eBay. We discuss some of these problems below, using emails and MP 3 s bought from iTunes as illustrative examples. The second key complication is that many important digital assets are controlled, both practically and legally, by intermediaries. This is true in the offline world as well sometimes – e. g. access to a bank account is controlled by the bank when the user dies – but it is much less common than in the online world. Access to Facebook profiles, for example, is entirely controlled by Facebook. A user cannot set up a profile there without entering a contract with Facebook. This contract is usually formed when a user clicks “I accept” or similar, and is therefore deemed to have read and accepted the terms and conditions set by Facebook. (Such agreements – whether known as “end user license agreements” or EULAs (as is common in games and virtual worlds); or terms and conditions (T&C); or Acceptable Use and Privacy Policies are all basically legal contracts.) When the user dies, control of the profile is still effectively with Facebook. They can close or delete or memorialise the profile, according to their own internal rules or norms, while the heirs may not even be able to read it if they are not FB users, or even if they are if they were not “Friends” with the deceased (and how many young people have their mother, say, as a Friend on Facebook?) Legally as far as Facebook is concerned, the relationship between them and the user, even after death, is primarily regulated by contract. The contract may simply not contain any rules on what happens on death – Facebook do give some insight into their internal rules[8] but many service provider contracts are simply blank on the matter, which may mean disputes are left to the discretion of abuse teams, or similar. Even where rules do exist though, there is a patent potential for conflict on death between the rules of contract and the rules of succession/executry. This major problem was first explored in case law in the celebrated Ellsworth and Yahoo! case, discussed in full below at section B. A connected and less often aired problem is that contract rules are a matter of private bargaining not social policy. While inheritance laws may have evolved to try to balance the interests of, say, parents and spouse of the deceased, or spouse and best friend, or even society (e. g. ultimus haeres rules), contract is unlikely to think about the public good or what value society places on family ties. This is particularly true in the context of social network or most online service contracts which are usually (as they say in consumer law) standard form contracts dictated to the user with significant imbalance of power and lack of opportunity to negotiate. In plain English, this mean that users rarely read the contracts they “sign” with online service providers and have no power to alter them even if they did; thus they are likely not to reflect their real wishes on death but merely what is commercially best for the service provider. There is often a lack of transparency as to what the service provider’s rules are, and a lack of consistency as to what the rules are from one service provider to another. This is why it is quite probable that what terms if any social network providers state about transmission of user accounts may well clash with the general law of succession; and that users are likely to have no idea what happens to their profiles etc when they die. Given the complexities described above, this chapter will mainly draw comparatively on the laws of the US and England and Wales, with a few references where relevant to EU law. In general as a matter of private law, succession and property laws in the EU are a matter <b>for</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> Some harmonised EU law, e. g. data protection law, is however relevant. Similarly in the US, succession law is largely a state not federal matter. As already noted, the lack of international (or often even national) harmonisation in this area is a particularly acute problem when talking about “globalised” or delocalised assets such as tweets or Facebook profiles. Another key problem is the simple novelty of the area, meaning there is a lack of legal precedent as well as good practice among solicitors/lawyers. Part of the plan for future Edwards/Harbinja research is to provide a one-stop shop guide for users and lawyers seeking guidance on devolution of particular digital assets on death. [1] Edwards L Law and the Internet (3 rd edn, Hart, 2009), ch 21, pp 687 - 690. [2] Playing games as piecework to create commercially transferable assets (or levels of play) is often called gold-farming, and usually done by developing world players on low wages to sell to time-poor developed world players.
