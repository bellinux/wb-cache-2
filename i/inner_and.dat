40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint source-channel coding problem of sending a memoryless source over a memoryless {{broadcast}} channel. An <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> several outer bounds on the achievable distortion region are derived, which respectively generalize and unify several existing bounds. As a consequence, we also obtain an <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> an outer bound for degraded broadcast channel case. When specialized to Gaussian source broadcast or binary source broadcast, the <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> outer bound not only recover {{the best known}} <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> outer bound in the literature, but also are used to generate some new results. Besides, we also extend the <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> outer bounds to Wyner-Ziv source broadcast problem, i. e., source broadcast with side information available at decoders. Some new bounds are obtained when specialized to Wyner-Ziv Gaussian case and Wyner-Ziv binary case. In addition, when specialized to lossless transmission of a source with independent components, the bounds for source broadcast problem (without side information) are also used to achieve an <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> an outer bound on capacity region of general broadcast channel with common messages, which respectively generalize Marton's <b>inner</b> bound <b>and</b> Nair-El Gamal outer bound to K-user broadcast channel case.

The Hunter {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions of the <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet {{is based on}} phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin {{and a variety of}} glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
