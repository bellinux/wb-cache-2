5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The <b>gullet</b> and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the <b>gullet,</b> with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the <b>gullet</b> folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the <b>gullet</b> head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the esophagus (<b>gullet).</b> The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the esophagus and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the esophagus in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E

5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's <b>gullet</b> was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The large {{quantity}} of artefacts and records which the AWRS had gathered were also returned to Australia in 1919, though work on organising {{them into an}} archive was not completed until 1932. The Australian War Museum was formed in 1919 {{on the basis of}} the Section's collection, and Treloar joined the Museum at some stage during the year. Henry Gullett was appointed the War Museum's first director on 11August 1919 after Bean turned down the position so that he could focus on editing and writing the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918. Treloar was appointed the Museum's deputy director on the same date. Bean, <b>Gullet</b> and Treloar were subsequently the key figures in the establishment of the AWM.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{became the}} acting {{director}} of the Australian War Museum in 1920 after Gullett resigned from the position and became head of the Australian Immigration Bureau. <b>Gullet</b> later wrote the official history of Australia's involvement in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Treloar was 26 years of age at the time he became director of the Museum and was responsible for the difficult task of establishing the institution. Between 1920 and 1922 he personally undertook much of the work associated with developing the Museum's first major exhibition, which opened in Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building on Anzac Day 1922. During this period the staff of the Australian War Museum were also responsible for providing administrative support for a program to distribute captured German equipment as war trophies to the Australian states. Treloar {{was a member of the}} committee overseeing this effort, and the associated administrative load came close to overwhelming him.|$|E

50|$|Gumming {{involves}} grinding the <b>gullets</b> of the {{saw teeth}} {{to a particular}} shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and {{in the presence of}} wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the saw band <b>gullets.</b> Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.|$|R
50|$|The turagathshee demons {{resemble}} tall, gangly humanoids {{with their}} heads replaced with huge, eyeless maws, their jaws positioned on top facing the sky, with their hinges attached to their shoulders so {{that the whole thing}} opens at once. Their <b>gullets</b> are partially extradimensional, so that they can consume things larger than they are.|$|R

25|$|The line ran {{south-south-east}} from Cuilhill <b>Gullet</b> (just east {{of where}} the present-day M73 crosses {{the line of the}} canal) along the line now occupied by Langmuir Road, then curving south-south-west to where Aitkenhead Road roundabout is now.|$|E
25|$|A crop, or croup, is a {{thin-walled}} expanded {{portion of}} the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the <b>gullet</b> or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{steel core}} can vary in design. Some cores have spaces (known as <b>gullets)</b> between {{segments}} to provide cooling and slurry removal, {{while others have}} a single continuous rim for smoother cutting. The type of core {{that can be used}} depends on the type of materials that the diamond blade is designed to cut.|$|R

25|$|Firstly, a hadith may be {{classified}} as gharib since it is narrated from one chain only. Al-Tirmidhi mentions as an example a tradition from Hammad ibn Salamah from Abu 'Usharai on the authority of his father who enquired from the Prophet whether the slaughtering of an animal is confined to the <b>gullet</b> and throat. The Prophet replied that stabbing the thigh will also suffice.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1968 Annadurai {{travelled}} to New York {{for medical}} treatment. He was operated for Cancer in the <b>gullet</b> at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center. He returned to Chennai in November {{and continued to}} address several official functions against medical advice. His health deteriorated further and he died on 3 February 1969. His cancer was attributed to his habit of chewing tobacco. His funeral had {{the highest number of}} attendees until then, as registered with The Guinness Book of Records. An estimated 15 million people attended it. His remains were buried in the northern end of Marina Beach, which is now called Anna Memorial.|$|E
25|$|This stork has a {{markedly}} broad {{diet and}} {{is considered to be}} a generalist compared to the sympatric wood stork and jabiru. It feeds on fish, frogs, eels, earthworms, invertebrates, insect larvae, snakes, freshwater crabs, small mammals such as rats, and bird eggs. More rarely, it may take smaller birds; as one case has shown where a large, intact rail was discovered in the <b>gullet</b> of an individual from Patagonia. Despite the maguari stork's apparently generalist diet, one study from Brazil has suggested that this stork may actively target worm lizards Amphisbaenae as prey items. This may be because of the elongated body shape of such taxa that occupies a relatively small volume in the bird's stomach and hence can more compactly fit inside the stomach to optimise the bird's energy intake.|$|E
60|$|Dor. This {{will not}} give you the {{reputation}} of a wit with me. You travelling monsieurs live upon the stock you have got abroad, {{for the first day}} or two: to repeat with a good memory, and apply with a good grace, is all your wit; and, commonly, your <b>gullets</b> are sewed up, like cormorants. When you have regorged what you have taken in, you are the leanest things in nature.|$|R
50|$|As the saw {{is drawn}} {{out of the}} kerf, the wood that has {{accumulated}} in the <b>gullets</b> is allowed to fall out onto the ground. A way {{to determine whether a}} saw is working well is to examine the noodle shaped strings of wood that are scraped out of the kerf; the presence of fairly long strings indicate that the side cutters are doing their job and that the raker is slicing out the wood cleanly.|$|R
60|$|They took me {{down into}} the dungeons. I was ordered to lie face-downward on the canvas spread flat upon the floor. I refused. One of the guards, Morrison, <b>gulletted</b> me with his thumbs. Mobins, the dungeon trusty, a convict himself, struck me {{repeatedly}} with his fists. In the end I lay down as directed. And, because of the struggle I had vexed them with, they laced me extra tight. Then they rolled me over like a log upon my back.|$|R
25|$|Onwards from Blair Bridge {{the canal}} is open again; the route here arcs northward towards {{and through the}} Drumpellier estate, passing north of Drumpellier Home Farm. The estate had a bridge {{connecting}} the northern area. The canal then heads west again, with a short northerly spur serving coal pits at Drumpellier, continuing under the present-day railway line, and under the Cuilhill Road bridge. A little to the west was Cuilhill <b>Gullet,</b> where {{an island in the}} canal was formed to enable the construction of the terminal of the Drumpeller Railway (the old spelling). The Railway is described below. Still continuing west, but culverted nowadays, the canal was crossed by a swing bridge at Netherhouse Road, and then at Rodgerfield Road, from where the course of the canal is covered by the M8 motorway.|$|E
500|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis, {{like all}} other species in the family Neritidae, has a radula which is of the rhipidoglossan type (a radula with many small {{marginal}} teeth which help [...] "brush" [...] food particles into the <b>gullet).</b> Zettler and colleagues (2004) and Zettler (2008) made SEM micrographs of the radula of this species.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the puzzle's name is unclear, {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that it is taken from the Ancient Greek word for throat or <b>gullet,</b> stomachos (...) [...] Ausonius refers to the puzzle as Ostomachion, a Greek compound word formed from the roots of [...] (osteon, bone) and [...] (machē, fight). The puzzle is also known as the Loculus of Archimedes or Archimedes' Box.|$|E

Do I blame thy social concern for the pleasures of others? Why, man, thou dost therein most philosophically {{multiply}} thine own. A man has but one throat, and can but eat, with his best efforts, some {{five or six times}} a day; but thou dinest with every friend that cuts a capon, and art quaffing wine in other men's <b>gullets,</b> from morning to night--et sic de cæteris." ...|$|R

60|$|Garnache made {{a grimace}} which the other did not observe. He {{stared at the}} little cut-throat, {{and there was some}} dismay in his glance. What ailed the rogue? Was he about to repent him of his sins, and to have done with villainy and treachery; was he minded to slit no more <b>gullets</b> in the future, be {{faithful}} to the hand that paid him, and lead a godlier life? Peste! That was a thing that would nowise suit Monsieur de Garnache's ends just then. If Arsenio had a mind to reform, let him postpone that reformation until Garnache should have done with him. So he opened his lips and let out a deep guffaw of mockery.|$|R
500|$|An expanded, muscular pouch {{near the}} <b>gullet</b> or throat {{found in some}} but not all birds. It {{is a part of}} the {{digestive}} tract, essentially an enlarged part of the esophagus, used for the storage of food prior to digestion.

500|$|Due to {{the time}} crunches of the fifth season, a [...] "convincing period movie" [...] was created in [...] "less time than humanly possible" [...] by members of The X-Files {{production}} staff. Costume designer Jenni <b>Gullet</b> set about renting and creating vintage clothing from the fifties; art director Gary Allen collected older copies of National Geographic to make J.

500|$|The {{esophagus}} (American English) or oesophagus (British English) (...) , {{commonly known}} as the food pipe or <b>gullet,</b> is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a [...] tube, about 25centimetres long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word esophagus is the Greek word οἰσοφάγος oisophagos, meaning [...] "gullet".|$|E
5000|$|Jews in Afghanistan and Iran hit {{each other}} over the head with green onions during the refrain {{beginning}} with the ninth stanza (Even if you had supplied our needs in the desert for 40 years but not provided us with manna). This may be due to a passage in Numbers 11:5-6, where the Israelites see manna and recall Egypt. [...] "We remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions and the garlic. Now our <b>gullets</b> are shriveled. There is nothing at all. Nothing but this manna to look at." [...] It is thought that by beating each other with the onions they taught themselves not to yearn for Egypt or to forget Egyptian slavery.|$|R
60|$|September 9th, Friedrich and Margraf Karl, {{correct to}} their appointment, meet at Grossenhayn, some {{miles north of}} Meissen and its Bridge; by which time Daun is clean gone again, back well above Dresden again, {{strongly}} posted at Stolpen (a place we once heard of, in General Haddick's time, last Year), well in contact with Daun's Pirna friends across the River, and out of dangerous neighborhoods. Friedrich and the Margraf have followed Daun at quick step; but Daun would pause nowhere, till he got to Stolpen, among the bushy <b>gullets</b> and chasms.
