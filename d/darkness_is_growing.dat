5000|$|... "The Bad Seed" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "great" [...] 8.4 out of 10 and {{wrote in her}} verdict, [...] "The <b>Darkness</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> up quickly which means she's {{going to be a}} real threat in no time at all. It's a relief to see the plot move forward at this rate. The mythology around the Darkness keeps building up too, and it was brilliant to see even the lower minions of heaven and hell be concerned about what's ahead. The only negative about this episode is that Castiel was restored to himself without suffering many consequences. He was in pain, yes, but there were opportunities to do more with the curse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giovanni is {{an elderly}} Italian master stonemason, who discovers a thirteen-year-old Erik {{on one of}} his sites one morning, and takes him on as an apprentice. Giovanni {{practically}} adopts Erik and loves him as the son he never had, while training him all the while as a mason. Erik flourishes underneath Giovanni's care, and though a <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> in the boy, the Italian helped to quell it for some time. Their rapport was interrupted by the return of Giovanni's youngest daughter, Luciana. Giovanni was the only father that Erik had ever known, and he almost hero-worshiped the man. For the rest of his life, Erik would refer to no other man as [...] "sir," [...] due to the trust that was eventually lost between them.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Jim Emerson {{wrote that}} Prince of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> an undervalued horror film: [...] "What makes me goose-pimply about Prince of <b>Darkness</b> <b>is</b> its goofy-but-ingenious central conceit and its truly Surrealistic imagery, {{some of which}} could have sprouted out of Bu√±uel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou." ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: At first glance, <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> {{merely the}} absence of light, and is {{therefore}} negative; hence the traditional equation of night with death, evil and the creatures of the underworld. But a closer study will reveal that <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> also a positive force; examples can be cited from various cultures where <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> thought to have given birth to light. The subterranean is the realm of fertility; the worshippers of Dionysius realised this, as did the followers of the world-wide cult of the Great Earth Mother. The realm of <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> also the habitat of the mystic. In this essay, we will attempt to define the nature of nocturnal imagery, and to trace the various ways in which mankind has sought to reconcile himself with the powers of darkness...|$|R
