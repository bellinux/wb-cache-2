40|$|Higher {{education}} {{policies are}} increasingly focused on <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes,</b> which infer an emphasis on, and deep understanding of, curriculum development across degree programs. As disciplinary influences {{are known to}} shape teaching and learning activities, research situated in disciplinary contexts is useful to further an understanding of curriculum development. In the life sciences, several <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> are underpinned by quantitative skills or an ability to apply mathematical and statistical thinking and reasoning. Drawing on data from a national teaching project in Australia that explored quantitative skills in the implemented curricula of 13 life sciences degree programs, this article presents four program level curricular models {{that emerged from the}} analysis. The findings are interpreted through the lens of discipline-specific research and general curriculum design theories to further our understanding of curriculum development for <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes.</b> Implications for future research and to guide curriculum development practices in higher education are discussed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Preparation of {{specialist}} {{critical care}} nurses in Australia is at graduate level, although there remains considerable variation in courses offered {{in relation to}} qualification, content, assessment and outcomes. As higher education providers must now comply with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) a {{study was conducted to}} examine existing critical care courses and <b>graduate</b> practice <b>outcomes.</b> METHODS: Twenty-two critical care courses were reviewed. Data sources included course provider, websites, course curricula and telephone interviews with course coordinators. A framework approach, was used consisting of five key stages: preliminary immersion of raw data, conceptualising a thematic framework, indexing, charting, mapping and interpretation of data. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed considerable variations in course delivery and <b>graduate</b> practice <b>outcomes.</b> Most courses used professional competency standards as a framework for course curricula and clinical assessment, with inconsistency in their translation to <b>graduate</b> practice <b>outcomes.</b> Twenty-one courses included clinical assessment at graduate certificate level with no clinical assessment conducted at master level. The expected practice outcome for fifteen courses was safe practice with graduates not expected to practice at a specialist or team leadership level. Minimum graduate practice standards were not included in three courses as an expected outcome. CONCLUSION: The AQF requires graduate nurse education to be compliant with academic outcome standards. The findings of our study indicate variations between courses and subsequent <b>graduate</b> practice <b>outcomes.</b> It is therefore timely to establish national critical care education graduate practice standards...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} students’ {{perceptions of their}} <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> including content knowledge, communication, writing, teamwork, quantitative skills, and ethical thinking in two Australian universities. One university has a traditional discipline-orientated curriculum and the other, an interdisciplinary curriculum in the entry semester of first year. The Science Students Skills Inventory asked students (n[*]=[*] 613) in first and final years to rate {{their perceptions of the}} importance of developing <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> within the programme; how much they improved their <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> throughout their undergraduate science programme; how much they saw learning outcomes included in the programme; and how confident they were about their learning outcomes. A framework of progressive curriculum development was adopted to interpret results. Students in the discipline-oriented degree programme reported higher perceptions of scientific content knowledge and ethical thinking while students from the interdisciplinary curriculum indicated higher perceptions of oral communication and teamwork. Implications for curriculum development include ensuring progressive development from first to third years, a need for enhanced focus on scientific ethics, and career opportunities from first year onwards...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} addressed two aims: {{to develop}} a systematic way to evaluate institutional engagement with <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> and to explore such engagement in higher education institutions in Aotearoa/New Zealand. An online survey was completed by 14 / 29 institutions with nine follow-up interviews to gather information on institutional engagement with <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Using a Maturity Modelling approach with indicators of planning, systems, delivery, assessment, evaluation and professional development support for <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes,</b> we assessed the level of engagement in each institution. Results revealed patchy engagement across the polytechnic and university sectors. There was strong engagement with the planning, systems and delivery of <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes,</b> particularly in the polytechnic sector, but much lower engagement with their assessment and evaluation, and overall, weak engagement with professional development support for <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Some mechanisms for promoting engagement with <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> were external drivers, a teaching-focused culture, strong leadership from the top and enabling structures. Our findings can inform institutional policies and practices {{in order to support}} not only compliance, but more importantly engagement with the graduate outcome agenda to improve the student learning experience...|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{aim was to}} determine what enables engagement with <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> in tertiary institutions in Aotearoa/New Zealand. We used a mixed methods approach comprising a survey sent to all tertiary institutions, follow-up interviews with 10 academic leaders and eight case studies of good practice of programmes engaged with <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> across four institutions. Using a general inductive approach, analysis of the academic leader interviews generated five categories of enablers: external drivers, structural/procedural, development, student achievement and contextual enablers. Combining these enablers led to an integrating framework for institutional engagement {{in the development of}} <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Drawing on wider datasets from the survey, interviews and cases studies, relevant strategies were identified that staff and students perceived influenced the development of <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes.</b> The framework and the associated strategies adopt a ‘whole-of-institution’ approach, which is inclusive of programmes, staff and students and their individual histories, traditions, cultures and purposes thus allowing for each institution’s unique characteristics...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with improving the process of curriculum renewal in engineering degrees {{by the use of}} Generic Graduate Sets of Learning Outcomes (GGSLOs) and curriculum mapping tools. GGSLO’s are an embodiment of professional competencies that engineering students should attain during their degree. These GGSLO’s can therefore be used by academics to improve professional aspects of their units-of-study. One of the central issues with GGSLO’s is that they list an extensive number of competencies, some of which may overlap in meaning and be similarly interpreted by the academics. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a data driven numerical approach is therefore used, to try and reduce the number of learning outcomes in a GGSLO. The approach is based on the mapping of unit-of-study learning outcomes from a degree stream to the generic <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> in the GGSLO, and an analysis of the combined data from multiple units-of-study, to determine similarities between the generic <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> in the GGSLO. The second part of the thesis investigates more broadly the issues affecting the limited use and implementation of generic <b>graduate</b> leaning <b>outcomes</b> into engineering curricula. A number of limiting factors are identified from literature, but the thesis extends the body of knowledge by investigating the limiting factors using naturalistic case studies with individual academics. The second question is premised on the idea that GGSLO’s are useful in curriculum renewal and that curriculum mapping tools should be an effective means to achieve implementation of generic <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> into the curriculum. The case studies therefore investigate the perception of academics in using GGSLO’s and curriculum mapping tools for curriculum renewal, and through these case studies, I seek to understand why generic <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> are currently not being effectively used or implemented in the curriculum renewal process.

40|$|Favourable <b>graduate</b> {{employment}} <b>outcomes</b> {{are critical}} for future enrolments in higher education. Enrolments fund higher education providers and ensure a continuous supply of graduates to enhance organisational effectiveness, national productivity and global competitiveness. Recent evidence suggests the global financial crisis has softened graduate labour markets. Stakeholder concerns for graduate career prospects and the adequacy of return on investment from studying at university prompt exploration of those factors which influence <b>graduate</b> employment <b>outcomes.</b> This study tests, using logistic regression, a model of job attainment in recent Bachelor graduates of Australian higher education providers using national data gathered in 2011 (n = 28, 246) and 2012 (n = 28, 009). Findings indicate employer selection criteria broadly align with our understanding of what constitutes graduate employability, including technical expertise, generic skill mastery and a successfully formed graduate identity. Labour market opportunities, however, are not based on merit alone with employers favouring those graduating from prestigious universities, part-time students and whose study incorporated elements of on-campus learning. There were also noted variations by discipline, age and residency status. The study enhances our understanding of which factors influence <b>graduate</b> employment <b>outcomes</b> and discusses implications for relevant stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The {{move into}} a competitive, {{international}} market place is changing the function and character {{of higher education in}} Australia. The mandating and mapping of generic <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> in Australian universities demonstrate the high stakes nature of higher education and the powerful influence of industry alliances. Increased competition for funding, globalisation, new technologies, and quality assurance processes have resulted in expanded operational models that include recruiting and catering for students {{from a wide range of}} social, cultural and academic backgrounds. The result is an increased concern for ways in which universities can effectively support such diverse student cohorts to ensure both equity and quality <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes.</b> This paper describes and evaluates the effectiveness of a generative curriculum model which was designed to address the needs and expectations of a diverse group of international students studying in Masters programs in an Australian university. The findings identify a number of challenges and benefits of the generative curriculum model, including concerns about the additional demands placed on teachers and students, and also positive reports about improved <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> and improvements to students’ sense of autonomy and agency...|$|E
40|$|Today’s science {{graduates}} require {{substantially different}} skills compared to yesterday’s graduates given {{the changing nature}} of modern science. As higher education institutions struggle to reform curricula and pedagogy, undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are increasingly being incorporated to enhance undergraduate science curricula. This study is situated within a traditional Bachelor of Science degree that offers students some voluntary opportunities to participate in UREs. This study explores two graduating science cohorts (n= 272), comparing those who did and did not participate in UREs. A survey investigated student perceptions (importance, confidence and improvements) of five <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> in the context of science: writing skills, communication skills, quantitative skills (QS), teamwork skills and content knowledge. Cross-tabs and a linear discriminant analysis were used to investigate perception change between the two groups. The notable differences in perception scores in this study were consistently higher in QS, perhaps indicative of UREs emphasising the need for such skills in science or from students gaining increased confidence as a result of utilising QS within an authentic context. Our results reveal little difference in other student outcome areas, which raises questions around the role of UREs as a broad strategy for enhancing the achievement of <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> in science. This study is limited to a single institution and is focused on specific <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes,</b> so only limited conclusions can be drawn. However, further research to determine the <b>graduate</b> <b>outcomes</b> gained from UREs would benefit the sector, particularly science disciplines, in the changing focus of government policy on student learning outcomes...|$|E

40|$|In the biosciences, {{quantitative}} {{skills are}} an essential <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcome.</b> Efforts to evidence student attainment {{at the whole}} of degree programme level are rare and making sense of such data is complex. We draw on assessment theories from Sadler (evaluative expertise) and Boud (sustainable assessment) to interpret final-year bioscience students’ responses to an assessment task comprised of quantitative reasoning questions across 10 mathematical and statistical topics. The question guiding the study was: do final year science students graduate knowing the quantitative skills that they have, and knowing the quantitative skills {{that they do not}} have? Confidence indicators for the 10 topics gathered students’ perceptions of their quantitative skills. Students were assigned to one of four categories: high performance-high confidence; low performance-low confidence; high performance-low confidence; or low performance-high confidence–with those in the first two categories demonstrating evaluative expertise. Results showed the majority of students effectively evaluated their quantitative skills as low performance-low confidence. We argue that the application of evaluative expertise to make sense of this <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcome</b> can further the debate on how assuring <b>graduate</b> learning <b>outcomes</b> can enhance student learning...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend within higher education and, more specifically, in higher degrees by research, to treat a professional skills set as a desirable <b>graduate</b> <b>outcome.</b> The increasing value that is being placed on a professional skills set in large part reflects growing interest {{around the world in}} the role of research degrees in labour markets and economic prosperity. Some have seen this shift as an opportunity to re-situate higher degrees by research as a form of professional education in the practices of research and scholarship. This raises a number of important issues for research education, which this article aims to identify. While a number of scholars has previously noted several of these issues, this article draws together key issues for interrogating the notion of research degrees as a form of professional education. In doing so, it points to ambiguities in expectations about what is produced through higher degrees by research programs...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the radical paucity of empirical {{data about the}} career destinations of journalism, media and communications graduates from degree programs. We report findings from a study of ten years of graduates from Queensland University of Technology’s courses in journalism, media, and communication studies, using a ‘Creative Trident’ lens to analyse micro individual survey data. The study findings engage with creative labour precarity discussions, and also assertions of creative graduate oversupply suggested by national <b>graduate</b> <b>outcome</b> statistics. We describe the graduates’ employment outcomes, characterise their early career movements {{into and out of}} embedded and specialist employment, and compare the capability requirements and degree of course relevance reported by graduates employed in the different Trident segments. Given that in general the graduates in this study enjoyed very positive employment outcomes, but that there were systematic differences in reported course relevance by segment of employment and role, we also consider how university programs can best engage with the task of educating students for a surprisingly diverse range of media and communication-related occupational outcomes within and outside the creative industries...|$|R

40|$|With an {{increasing}} focus on academic standards, quality and <b>graduate</b> employability <b>outcomes,</b> Australian Higher Education institutions {{have a greater}} need to develop and utilise feedback mechanisms to assess and improve <b>graduate</b> employability <b>outcomes.</b> This paper reports {{on the development of}} the Graduate Employability Indicators (GEI), a suite of surveys for graduates, employers and members of the course teaching team on the importance of 14 employment capabilities for graduate workplace success and their demonstration by new graduates up to five years out. These surveys have been developed through an ALTC grant, Building course team capacity for graduate employability, a collaborative project between Curtin University, RMIT University, University of Southern Queensland and Victoria University. The paper outlines the similarities and differences between the GEI and other indicators, such as the Australian Graduate Pathways Survey (GPS), the Australasian Survey of Student Engagement (AUSSE) and the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), demonstrating its potential use in national and international benchmarking activities. Summary visual data on the perspectives of graduates from one of the pilot surveys is also provided to demonstrate the type of information that can be gleaned from the surveys...|$|R

40|$|Education for Sustainability (EfS) is {{variously}} recognised by universities as part {{of becoming}} a sustaining organisation; central to institutions' moral obligations in terms of graduate capabilities; and essential to curriculum innovation, reinvention and renewal. However, its implementation into curricula on a global basis is variable, with some countries being more advanced than others. At the discipline level, sustainability may be embedded as core content, or given only tokenistic support through elective offerings. This paper examines EfS as both a business and moral driver of curriculum change in universities and the associated barriers that may be encountered during implementation. The results from desktop research and semi-structured interviews with employees responsible for sustainability programs from four universities in the metropolitan region of Sydney, Australia, are presented.
