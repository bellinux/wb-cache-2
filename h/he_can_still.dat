5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E

Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting her dark side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E

Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> change for the better and become a kinder person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli says he has a family back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, not even to meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E
