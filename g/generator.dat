5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a <b>generator</b> set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC <b>generator</b> was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC <b>generator</b> provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the <b>generator</b> relative to the turbine's swept area. A small <b>generator</b> would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large <b>generator</b> would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E

This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable <b>generator</b> {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m <b>generator.</b> The <b>generator</b> contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201.

40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{methods of}} {{constructing}} <b>generators</b> {{of the complex}} cobordism ring provide examples of <b>generators</b> that are connected or algebraic, but not both simultane-ously. The focus {{of this paper is}} to construct complex cobordism polynomial <b>generators</b> in many dimensions using smooth projective toric varieties. This offers a new technique for constructing <b>generators,</b> and the resulting <b>generators</b> are both connected and algebraic. Such <b>generators</b> are constructed in every complex dimension that is odd or one less than a prime power. A large amount of evidence suggests that smooth projective toric varieties can serve as polynomial <b>generators</b> in the remaining dimensions as well. 1...|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, two {{additional}} generators {{were added to}} the power station, bringing the total to six. Between 1995 and 2003, the dam's six hydroelectric generators were upgraded, bringing the installed capacity of the power plant from 92 MW to 120 MW and increasing its generation 20%. Each autumn, a <b>generator</b> was taken out of service, upgraded and returned to service by spring of the next year. The sixth and final <b>generator</b> upgrade was completed in May 2003.

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-{{generators}}, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada <b>generator</b> went online and the first Arizona <b>generator</b> by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final <b>generator</b> was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16large generators, eight {{on each side of the}} river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each <b>generator</b> was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave <b>generator).</b> The wave <b>generator</b> {{illustrates}} wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave <b>generator</b> could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching.
