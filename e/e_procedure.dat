Numerical examples are presented, showing the accuracy of the proposed scheme. It is shown that, even if the frame presents step-wise changes of the geometrical properties throughout its height, very few elements (1 or 2) can be successfully employed for the modelling of coupled shear walls, and the number of degrees of freedom becomes substantially independent of the building height. This circumstance drastically reduces the complexity of the analysis and the computational effort to obtain the numerical solution, so that the proposed method can be very useful for design...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{programming}} languages such as Haskell or ML {{allow the}} programmer to implement {{and to use}} higher-order procedures. A higher-order procedure gets a function as argument and applies this function to some values. For instance, procedure map applies a function to all elements of a list and returns {{the list of the}} result values. Verifying that a higher-order program satisfies a certain property is particularly challenging, because it involves reasoning about indirect function calls; for instance, a call map(f, l) directly calls procedure map and indirectly calls function f if list l is non-empty. Using a higher-order procedure g, a procedure f can be defined by higher-order recursion; i. <b>e.,</b> <b>procedure</b> f (directly) calls g and passes itself as an argument to g, which leads to indirect recursive calls. These indirect recursive calls make reasoning about higherorder programs difficult.

These variations are considered primarily in the 24 -hour time horizon. These problems are aggravated further if the DHS is supplied by a CHP plant, because fluctuations in heat demand adversely affect to a significant degree the stable production of electricity at high overall efficiency.

Objective: To compare the outcomes of two different regimens for cervical priming with misoprostol before dilatation and evacuation (D & E) in 13 weeks - 16 weeks gestation pregnancy terminations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical records of two cohorts of 334 women each who were treated with either 3 sublingual doses of 2 misoprostol 200 µg tablets 30 minutes apart on admission or the same dosage preceded by 1 oral tablet of misoprostol 200 µg at home 3 hours before admission. Results: The addition of the home tablet of misoprostol increased the rate of one day completion of D & E from 97. 3 % to 100 % (P = 0. 004), and the overall mean theatre time for D&E was reduced by 12. 3 % in parous women (P = 0. 001) and 6. 4 % in nulliparous women (P = 0. 003) with the reduction being consistent across all gestations.

40|$|There {{have been}} many {{documents}} published that set strategic goals for the future, including transportation-related goals. However, few documents focus heavily on a specific approach to improve transportation safety. Therefore, a supporting policy document focused on transportation safety is required {{to ensure that the}} transportation system runs safely and efficiently; a Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) serves as that document. A SHSP is a high-level traffic safety policy that represents a scientific, data-driven, four to five year comprehensive safety document that is designed to identify a jurisdiction’s emphasis areas (i. e., key areas of safety concern) and target safety goals [i. e., collision reduction goal(s) ], and may also include network screening (i. e., identification of high collision locations) and safety strategies/programs for each chosen emphasis area. There are, however, limited documents that discuss the procedure {{for the development of a}} SHSP specifically for a municipality. Therefore, the goal of this research was to improve traffic safety by reducing the number and severity of collisions in municipalities across Canada. The objective for this research was to develop a data-driven and more scientific municipal-level SHSP development process (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>procedure</b> and key components) that may be used to improve traffic safety for municipalities across Canada. Existing procedures, key components and approaches to develop the key components in existing SHSPs published mainly in North America were reviewed. The literature review (FHWA, 2006; CCMTA, 2011 b) suggested that the typical procedure for the development of a SHSP is identifying a “champion” (i. e., an individual or unit with high-level leadership), developing a vision, identifying key stakeholders, developing the key components (i. e., selecting the key emphasis areas, establishing target safety goals, selecting the strategies/programs for the chosen key emphasis areas), and updating and evaluating the SHSP. The existing procedures and key components were adjusted to create the modified process. The modified process consisted of two additional steps to the procedure: 1) Incorporating Upper-Level Policies and 2) Conducting Network Screening. The modified process also outlined the most appropriate approaches to use to develop the key components of a municipal-level SHSP. The modified process (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>procedure</b> and key components) was applied to develop a municipal-level SHSP for the City of Saskatoon through a case study to compare the results to the existing process. Saskatoon’s SHSP included seven emphasis areas for a definite period of time (i. e., for the next five years). Target safety goals, network screening and strategies/programs were also developed, but only for the selected emphasis areas. Recent ten-year (2001 - 2010) collision data from the SGI was used to select emphasis areas, develop target safety goals and conduct network screening. Based on the case study results, upper-level policies should be incorporated in the development of the key components of a municipal-level SHSP. This is because a municipal-level SHSP is the lowest-level SHSP and should incorporate the emphasis areas, target safety goals and strategies/programs that are included in upper-level SHSPs (i. e., provincial- and federal-level). In addition, the SHSP can act as an operational-level safety action plan that supports a jurisdiction’s Strategic Plan. The addition of network screening also provides useful locations in a municipal-level SHSP. The case study results showed that the modified process provided detailed information required by a municipality to make informed safety investment decisions compared to the basic information the existing process provided. Therefore, the modified process is a data-driven and more scientific process that can be used to develop SHSPs that will improve traffic safety for municipalities across Canada...|$|E

In this study, the problems arising from the use of different languages ​​in the bureaucracy are discussed, the issue is limited to bureaucratic language, and minorities and strangers are not allowed to use their languages in education, culture or publication. When the impacts were examined, the measures taken by the victim were evaluated.
