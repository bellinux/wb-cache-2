500|$|Writer Simon Moore {{finished}} his spec script for The Quick and the Dead in late 1992, writing it as a {{homage to the}} Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the Dollars Trilogy starring Clint Eastwood. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. [...] "When you introduce women {{into that kind of}} world, something very interesting happens and you <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> dynamic straight away," [...] Moore commented. The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible. Moore considered directing his own script as an independent film and shooting The Quick and the Dead on a $3–4 million budget in either Spain or Italy.|$|E
500|$|With the {{assistance}} of scriptwriter Tony Williamson, Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, had drafted a 194-page treatment long before the initial meeting with Kanter. The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry {{that we try to}} develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> and entertaining premise. He also discussed the significance of the title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E
500|$|After Fox {{picked up}} the show, it {{acquired}} the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain ("zebra" [...] is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while [...] "circling the drain" [...] refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was {{of a team of}} doctors working together trying to [...] "diagnose the undiagnosable". Shore felt it was important to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore {{and the rest of the}} creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named [...] "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the [...] "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show". Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.|$|E

500|$|Upon her introduction, Chloe was {{received}} positively by audiences. Soap Opera Weekly praised the character, stating, [...] "What {{started as a}} 10-episode arc as a bitchy stylist transformed into a meaty contract character and an even meatier storyline for Elizabeth Hendrickson." [...] The magazine also considered Chloe the [...] "complex Genoa City bad girl", and observed that [...] "viewers aren't exactly loving Chloe" [...] for driving a wedge between the popular pairing of Cane and Lily. Speaking of the character's pregnancy, Allison Waldman of TV Squad was unconvinced of Chloe's schemes regarding the child's paternity, writing, [...] "I'm having doubts about Chloe's bun in the oven. She claims that Cane's the father, based on one drunken night in a car that he has blacked out of his memory. Chloe's hardly a reliable source, especially since it's just been revealed that she's Kate, Esther's daughter. Yes, Esther, Kay's maid for the last 20 years or so. Cane's had DNA tests done, but they only prove {{he could be the}} baby's father. Watch, this baby is going to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> back story." [...] Carolyn Hinsey of the New York Daily News said Chloe's backstory reveal was a [...] "shock" [...] to fans and in light of her pregnancy wrote, [...] "Anyone who thinks Chloe's lies are over hasn't been paying attention. Is the baby even Cane's?" [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it credited the character as a [...] "quirky fashion diva", and penned the reunion between Chloe and Esther [...] "long overdue".|$|E

Over the first sixteen games in which Kingman and Valentine batted fourth and fifth in the line-up, Kingman clubbed seven home runs with sixteen RBIs. Valentine, meanwhile, batted just [...]176 over that stretch with one home run and seven RBIs. Almost as if National League {{pitchers}} realized {{they had nothing to}} fear from Valentine's bat, Kingman began seeing tougher pitching again, and hit just three more home runs over the rest of the season.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the Adana Inscription, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus. [...] As James Francis put it, [...] "the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius {{appears to have been a}} wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire." [...] What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice, and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. [...] A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae, and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. [...] As for his philosophical convictions, we <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting,</b> probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (On sacrifices), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving nous (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.|$|E

2500|$|Though lyric poetry prevailed at Frederick's (and later Manfredi's) court, {{it is at}} {{this time}} that we <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{exception}} in Rosa fresca aulentissima (transl: [...] "Fresh very perfumed rose"), widely known as Contrasto and attributed to Cielo d'Alcamo (also known as Ciullu di Vincenzullu), about which modern critics have much exercised themselves. This Contrasto is written in a Sicilian language close to that spoken in the city of Messina, with several influences from continental Italian variants. The subject is a humorous fight between two young lovers, a kind of poetry quite common in the Middle Ages (as contrasti or pastorelle). It is about a young suitor who sneaks into the garden of a young lady from a rich Sicilian family and secretly declares his love to her. He then tries to seduce the girl with his one-liners; she berates him for his [...] "ill" [...] intentions and keeps him at bay to protect her honor, but her prudeness proves eventually to be just a love game: she gives in completely to his bold advances. However, the language uses much of the courtly language of lyric poetry and the result is a parody of the Sicilian School's clichés. The Contrasto belongs to the time of the emperor Frederick II (it can be dated between 1230 and 1250, but probably closer to the latter), and is also important as a proof that there once existed a popular, independent of literary, poetry prior to Frederick's times. Now most critics agree that the Contrasto of Cielo d'Alcamo is probably a scholarly re-elaboration of some lost popular song. It is perhaps the closest to a kind of poetry that has perished or which was smothered by the Sicilian literature of Frederick's. Its distinguishing feature was its hilarity and down-to-earthedness as opposed to the abstract verse of the Sicilian School. But {{it has been argued that}} its style betrays a profound knowledge of Frederick's movement and some critics have hinted the man who penned it must have been acquainted with or even been part of, the court itself. Given the highly satiric and erotic vein Ciullo d'Alcamo may well be a fictitious name. [...] His Contrasto shows vigor and freshness in the expression of feelings: [...] Such [...] "low" [...] treatment of the love-theme shows that its subject-matter is certainly popular. This poem sounds real and spontaneous, marked as it is by the sensuality characteristic of the people of southern Italy.|$|E
