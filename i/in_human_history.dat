5|$|Marx {{has been}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} influential figures <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history</b> and his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and subsequent economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.|$|E

5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b> Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b> Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history</b> — more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were committed than had ever been deployed before in a single offensive. The invasion opened up the Eastern Front of World War II, the largest theater of war during that conflict, and it witnessed clashes of unprecedented violence and destruction for four years {{that resulted in the}} deaths of more than 26 million Soviet people. More people died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II. Damage to both the economy and landscape was enormous for the Soviet Union as approximately 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages were razed.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program has}} been called the {{greatest}} technological achievement <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b> Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.|$|E

5|$|Under Hitler's {{leadership}} and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime {{was responsible for}} the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians {{died as a result of}} military action in the European theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Xerxes {{retreated to}} Asia {{with much of}} his army, leaving Mardonius to {{complete}} the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, {{the remainder of the}} Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. The Persians made no further attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea thus mark {{a turning point in the}} course of the Greco-Persian wars as a whole; from then onward, the Greek poleis would take the offensive. A number of historians believe that a Persian victory would have hamstrung the development of Ancient Greece, and by extension western civilization, and this has led them to argue that Salamis is one of the most significant battles <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lasting over 680 years, the Roman–Persian War was {{the longest}} {{conflict}} <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b> Despite this, the frontier remained largely stable. A game of tug of war ensued: towns, fortifications, and provinces were continually sacked, captured, destroyed, and traded. Neither side had the logistical strength or manpower to maintain such lengthy campaigns far from their borders, and thus neither could advance too far without risking stretching its frontiers too thin. Both sides did make conquests beyond the border, but in time the balance was almost always restored. The line of stalemate shifted in the 2nd century AD: it had run along the northern Euphrates; the new line ran east, or later northeast, across Mesopotamia to the northern Tigris. There were several substantial shifts further north, in Armenia and the Caucasus. Although initially different in military tactics, the armies of both sides gradually adopted {{from each other and}} by {{the second half of the}} 6th century they were similar and evenly matched.|$|E

40|$|Parasite {{adversity}} was {{an important}} source of Darwinian selection <b>in</b> <b>human</b> evolutionary <b>history</b> because parasites selected for a diversity of <b>human</b> behavioral parasite-defenses <b>in</b> addition to the numerous defenses provided by the classical human immune system. We argue for a broader view of behavioral immunity than has been emphasized recently. We propose a new hypothesis for the evolution of the unique cognitive and social adaptations of humans. We argue that, <b>in</b> <b>human</b> evolutionary <b>history,</b> as weaponry and other technologies reduced the importance of the physical environment, typical ecological challenges, and predators as agents of selection shaping mental and social traits, parasites became more important selection agents on these traits. Also, we suggest that the reduction of natural selection in the context of predation <b>in</b> <b>human</b> evolutionary <b>history</b> resulted <b>in</b> selection favoring high pathogenicity <b>in</b> <b>human</b> parasites because predation is focused on debilitated prey and hence selects against pathogenicity in the parasites involved. The new hypothesis argues that, <b>in</b> <b>human</b> evolutionary <b>history,</b> temporal variation in local parasite adversity gave rise to frequent change and complexity in the values that are adaptive for individuals to use in their social navigation in relation to the degree of local disease stress, and that selection in this context accounts for the evolution of aspects of <b>human</b> uniqueness <b>in</b> cognitive ability and sociality. The new hypothesis is akin to the social brain hypothesis but is contrary to the version of that hypothesis deemphasizing parasites. Tests of the new hypothesis are addressed...|$|R
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history</b> (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Haiti {{started with}} the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492. The {{practice}} was devastating to the native population. Following the indigenous Taino's near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomeu de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church began engaging in earnest in the kidnapped and forced labour of enslaved Africans. During the French colonial period beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as Saint-Domingue) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world. The Haitian Revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history,</b> precipitated the end of slavery not only in Saint-Domingue, but in all French colonies. However, several Haitian leaders following the revolution employed forced labor, believing a plantation-style economy was the only way for Haiti to succeed, and building fortifications to safeguard against attack by the French. During the U.S. occupation between 1915 and 1934, the U.S. military forced Haitians to work building roads for defense against Haitian resistance fighters.|$|E
5|$|World War II, or the Second World War, was {{a global}} {{military}} conflict, the joining {{of what had}} initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. This global conflict split {{the majority of the}} world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of total war, erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities {{for the purposes of the}} war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>history.</b> The Allies were victorious, and, as a result, the United States and Soviet Union emerged as the world's two leading superpowers.|$|E
