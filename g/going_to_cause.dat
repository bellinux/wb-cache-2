25|$|At Martinsville, Kenseth {{came into}} a turn going very fast, causing {{his car to}} wheel-hop. He hit Kevin Harvick hard, who's still in the Chase, causing Harvick to spin. Harvick hit the wall hard and fell 42 laps back. After hitting Harvick, a {{sideways}} Kenseth was bumped by Tony Stewart and straightened Kenseth out of his spin with no more damage. Laps later, after Harvick {{had returned to the}} track, he saw Kenseth coming behind him. Harvick, purposely checked-up trying to smash up Kenseth's radiator. Kenseth saw what Harvick was doing and checked-up enough to avoid serious damage. Kenseth still finished in 6th place and is in 4th place of the Chase. Harvick finished in 33rd putting Kenseth 28 points down and swore that if this race is the cause of him not making it further into the Chase, that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> Kenseth not to make it either.|$|E

His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> us quite a little trouble in the future.

Because of this, evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in Rarotonga. Forecasters also {{predicted that}} Percy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a strong storm surge. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12–24hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern Cook Islands to order evacuations.|$|E

500|$|According to Robert Simpson, {{there are}} no reasons for a Category6 on the Saffir–Simpson Scale because it is {{designed}} to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures. Simpson stated that [...] "...when you get up into winds in excess of [...] you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered." [...] Despite his statements, the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade in Florida have building codes which require critical infrastructure buildings to be able to withstand Category5 winds, which contradicts Mr. Simpson's assessment of building strength.|$|E

With such a song and video, she was throwing in America's face the image of a country ravaged by the abortion debate, which is far from being resolved." [...] Lynda Hart, {{one of the authors of}} Acting Out: Feminist Performances, felt that the video [...] "alternated between two competing representations of Madonna... Charging coercion, both sides make the video as an invitation to a certain way of life, in the process denying it the stylistic invocation of a rhetoric of self-authorization."

500|$|Early on {{the second}} day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the {{opposition}} wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire Charlie Elliott and his batting partner John Edrich. As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, [...] "Well played—my God you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> some problems." [...] D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped {{a few more times}} after passing three figures. He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from John Gleeson, one of the opposing Australians. Oborne assesses the innings {{as one of the best}} ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him. Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for Derek Underwood to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters.

Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have been interesting as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special treat each afternoon."

And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a lot of trouble.

2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond force constant, ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are going to affect the vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large hysteresis loop.|$|E
