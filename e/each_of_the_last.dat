5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three Tests by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown put on the first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E

5|$|Poulton had {{her most}} {{productive}} {{season in the}} WNCL in 2008–09 ahead of the 2009 World Cup, scoring 376 runs at 41.77. She posted two half-centuries {{in the first four}} matches, resulting in eight-wicket wins over Queensland and Western Australia respectively. She then made fifties in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three round-robin matches. This included 60 and 53 against Victoria in the last two games, which New South Wales won win by nine and three wickets respectively. New South Wales thus earned the right to host the final against the same team, and Poulton made 43 as they chased down 118 and won the title by six wickets. Poulton totalled 0/48 from 11 overs during the WNCL. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches, scoring 23 and 35. New South Wales won the first before losing by one wicket to Victoria in the second.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools.

The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E

5|$|This was the 90th {{meeting of}} the rival schools that have fought for the Paul Bunyan Trophy {{annually}} since 1953. Michigan State's 5–1 start was its best since the 1966 team. On the strength of zero fourth quarter points and only 9 second half points, Michigan entered the game tied for first nationally in average points allowed (8.3) and in second in both yards of total offense allowed (207.7) and defensive pass efficiency. Michigan State entered {{the game with a}} 34 points per game average, which was the schools best since the 1978 team. Although Michigan held a 58–26–5 series edge, the home team had won <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> five meetings and Michigan State had won 7 consecutive home games. Sophomore linebacker Dhani Jones had led Michigan in tackles {{in each of the three}} previous games and was second on the defense in tackles for the season.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Loxton {{served with}} the 2nd Armoured Division. He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh, Victoria and was {{discharged}} on 7 November 1945 with the rank of sergeant, having {{spent most of his}} time at the division headquarters. The war ended Loxton and Miller’s partnership at St Kilda. Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England, while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne, enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave. In 1943, Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season, all of which were lost, kicking seven goals, and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games. He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal-less against Melbourne. The following year, Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda’s goal-kicking aggregates with 52. After making a slow start to the season, aggregating only four goals in the first four matches, including two goal-less outings, he began to score more heavily. The St Kilda forward registered a six-goal haul against Geelong in round eight, helping to secure an away win, and scored 23 goals in the last six matches, including five in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three matches. However, St Kilda won only one of these three matches. Loxton's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams, and he came second in the club Best and Fairest. He played a solitary match in 1945, which St Kilda lost, and went goal-less.|$|E

5|$|His bowling confounded the English {{team in the}} Third Test at Headingley in Leeds, {{where he}} took 7/58 in the first innings and 4/27 in the second. It was his best innings and match bowling figures in Tests and helped win the Test and {{eventually}} retain The Ashes. Australia had struggled to post 188 in their first innings on a pitch conducive to spin bowling, with Macartney scoring only four. Australia responded with a dual spin attack, with Noble bowling off spin in tandem with Macartney's left arm orthodox. Noble (0/22 from 13 overs) tied down the batsman, allowing Macartney to attack at batsman at the other end. He bowled with a high trajectory, tempting the batsmen to attack him and then varied his bowling speed to surprise them. He had Jack Sharp stumped after luring him from the crease and bowled Jack Hobbs with a faster ball. Other victims included English captain MacLaren, JT Tyldesley, George Hirst and Sydney Barnes. England were bowled out for 182 and Australia replied with 207; Macartney scored 18. Australia {{went on to win}} by 126 runs after Macartney took four more wickets in the second innings, removing MacLaren, Tyldesley, Rhodes and Barnes to help dismiss the hosts for 87. Macartney then made a half-century and took a wicket in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two Tests, both of which were drawn to hand Australia a 2–1 series win.|$|E
