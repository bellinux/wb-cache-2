5|$|At 03:50 on 31 July, the Battle of Pilckem Ridge began. The {{division}} {{was ordered to}} capture the German front line, the second line positions based on Pilckem Ridge, a low ridge that also contained the heavily shelled village of Pilckem, followed by Iron Cross Ridge which lay to the east, before storming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> and across a small stream known as the Steenbeck. The division would be opposed primarily by the German 3rd Guards Infantry Division, along with elements of the 3rd Reserve Division and 111th Division, dug-in among trench lines and 280 concrete pillboxes and bunkers. To secure these various objectives, the division planned to attack in waves, with fresh troops constantly moving forward to tackle the next objective.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compartments and Double Bedrooms {{are private}} rooms for two passengers, with {{upper and lower}} berths, washbasins, and private toilets, placed {{on one side of}} the car, with the {{corridor}} running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> (thus allowing the accommodation to be slightly over two thirds the width of the car). Frequently, these accommodations have movable partitions allowing adjacent accommodations to be combined into a suite.|$|E
60|$|Rochester stooped <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> and Saton {{opened his}} eyes slowly.|$|R
60|$|Syme {{had jumped}} <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> {{but he still}} stood {{listening}} impatiently.|$|R
60|$|Hodder sat <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> fireplace. He, too, {{seemed to}} be striving for a common footing.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his inspection of the Cinderhill section on 1 January, Major Pringle also included the Carlton extension. Services on the latter commenced on 5 January, cars running alternately to the Market Place or to Colwick Road, via Station Street. Following the Council meeting in January, an immediate start was made with the line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of Carlton Hill into Carlton. The Derby Road and Arnold extensions followed.|$|E
25|$|The ridge northward to Great Carrs {{is named}} Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope {{climbing}} out of the Greenburn valley between neighbouring crags. The ridge is a grassy plateau with a pronounced downward tilt to the west. The eastern edge is precipitous, curving around the head of Greenburn. On the journey to Great Carrs the path passes a memorial. This {{is the site of}} a wartime aircrash and bears the sad remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force Handley Page Halifax bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial cairn lies {{on the top of the}} ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. In his guidebook The Southern Fells Alfred Wainwright suggests that the plane approached from the west, failed to clear the ridge and tumbled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> In fact, the wrecked aircraft came to rest on the western slope; the majority of the wreckage was subsequently pushed over the edge of broad slack by the RAF salvage crew, in order to make it less prominent and reduce the likelihood of overflying pilots spotting the wreckage and repeatedly reporting the crash. An engine and propeller from the aircraft are preserved at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston. The tilted plateau of the north ridge is triangular in plan, narrowing to a point at Fairfield in the west. This is the col between Swirl How and the ridge's western outlier, Grey Friar. To the north of this ridge are long slopes leading down to the Duddon at Wrynose Bottom.|$|E
500|$|According to Geisel, he {{was walking}} down Madison Avenue in New York City after {{learning}} of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old Dartmouth College classmate. McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's president James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, [...] "If I had been walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today." [...] In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed {{the name of the}} book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.|$|E
50|$|As looks, ride quality, and {{handling}} became {{more important to}} consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running straight over both axles, arched frames sit lower—roughly level with their axles—and curve up over the axles and then back <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing, but don't curve <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> and are more common on front ends.|$|R
60|$|Inside of an {{hour the}} young hunters had passed to the extreme end {{of the lake and}} were coning <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... 1988 – First [...] "cross-over" [...] climb by Chinese, Japanese and Nepalese teams which {{ascended the}} peak {{simultaneously}} {{from both the}} North and South sides of the mountain and descended <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> [...] The cross-over climb {{was also the first}} to be recorded on live broadcast television.|$|E
2500|$|They forage in sun flecks and {{the gaps}} created by fallen trees, {{where there is}} enough light to see spider webs. [...] Several species have been {{observed}} searching for webs by flying up {{one side of a}} tree and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> [...] When they locate one they hover in front of it. [...] To catch a spider they first fly backward, then quickly fly forward to grab it in their forelegs. [...] Then they back away again and perch to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body. [...] Though this careful forward-and-back approach minimizes contact with the web, they often preen after eating to remove any strands that do adhere to them.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{conflicting}} signals from Meade, Sedgwick and Warren followed {{the more conservative}} course. They waited to start until Ewell's Corps had cleared out of Fairfield and remained {{at a safe distance}} behind it as it moved west. Lee assumed that Sedgwick would attack his rear and was ready for it. He told Ewell, [...] "If these people keep coming on, turn back and thresh them." [...] Ewell replied, [...] "By the blessing of Providence I will do it" [...] and ordered Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division to form a battle line. The VI Corps followed Lee only to the top of Monterey Pass, however, and did not pursue <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Ramps are {{inclined}} planes {{with a gentle}} enough slope that the ball may travel along it. The player attempts to direct the ball with enough force {{to make it to}} the top of the ramp and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> If the player succeeds, a [...] "ramp shot" [...] has been made. Ramps frequently end in such a way that the ball goes to a flipper so one can make several ramp shots in a row. Often, the number of ramp shots scored in a game is tallied, and reaching certain numbers may lead to various game features. At other times, the ramps will go to smaller [...] "mini-playfields" [...] (small playfields, usually raised above the main game surface, with special goals or scoring).|$|E
2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be {{converted}} to other forms. [...] For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top. [...] The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the hill. [...] Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively the cyclist could connect a dynamo to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent. [...] The bicycle would be traveling slower {{at the bottom of the}} hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy. [...] Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as heat.|$|E
2500|$|The western flank {{is named}} Willie Wife Moor for reasons lost to antiquity. It is bounded by Birkside Gill {{to the north}} and Raise Beck to the south, Reggle Knott being the only area of rough ground. At the base of the slope Raise Beck flows north to Thirlmere, having been {{diverted}} {{as a part of the}} 1884 reservoir project. It previously turned south <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of Dunmail Raise pass to feed Grasmere. [...] Before this diversion, Dollywaggon Pike was distinctive in that its drainage reached the sea at more widely spread points than any other Lakeland Fell, with Raise Beck going through Grasmere and Windermere to reach Morecambe Bay, Birkside Gill going through Thirlmere and Derwent Water to reach the Irish Sea at Workington and Grisedale Beck draining into Ullswater and then to the sea at the Solway Firth. This is still the case today when there is enough water in Raise Beck for it to flow both north and south, but normally Seat Sandal now has this distinction.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no {{marks of}} any one jumping <b>down</b> upon <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us {{go back to the}} bedroom and talk the matter over." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} seemed glad of any excuse for {{breaking}} the silence. 'Why, Miss Swancourt, what a risky thing to do!' he exclaimed, immediately following her example by jumping <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "I {{will make}} you a payment, so as {{to put you in}} funds, and that must be put <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> How much would you like?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dave {{squeezed}} {{himself into}} the driver's seat, {{and a moment later}} they were off again over the plateau of the hill, and then <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Deering nodded. [...] "Stannard {{sent them}} back and pushed ahead with Gillane {{to look for a}} line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> When we get across we'll see what he was up against." ...|$|E
6000|$|Goree was {{standing}} near the window. [...] "Step here," [...] he said, raising his finger, [...] "and I'll show you your recently purchased enemy. There he goes, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the street." ...|$|E

50|$|Friday, June 16, 1977, saw {{the opening}} of the Ridgeway Four theatre in East Memphis. The opening slate of films was A Bridge Too Far, The Little Girl Who Lives <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Lane, <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> of Midnight, and Final Chapter - Walking Tall. The Ridgeway Four also became the {{location}} of Malcos corporate headquarters and continues to serve in that capacity.|$|R
60|$|Between {{the houses}} on the very top, they passed at a slow trot; and soon began {{slanting}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> Mr. Treffry brought them to a halt where a mule track joined the road.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was warm}} and bright. Conger's shoes crunched the melting crust of snow. On he went, through the trees heavy with white. He climbed a hill and strode <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> sliding as he went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll get {{you there}} in time--don't worry," [...] was the ready reply, {{and then the}} driver cracked his whip and sent his horses <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the hill at a good rate of speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I wouldn't talk much, Miss Birdseye," [...] said Doctor Prance, who had now knelt <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of her. [...] "We {{know how}} much you have done. Don't you suppose every one knows your life?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the moment}} of {{speaking}} her hat had blown off into the road, their present speed on the upland being by no means slow. D'Urberville pulled up, {{and said he would}} get it for her, but Tess was <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
