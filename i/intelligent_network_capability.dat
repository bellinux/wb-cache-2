This leads to the synthesis of a new multi-level relationship between {{services and}} features, allowing a more consistent construction of services from their components. KEYWORDS: Capability Set, Feature, Intelligent Network, Service, Telecommunications 1 INTRODUCTION The Intelligent Network (IN) is being standardised by ITU-T in the Q. 12 xy series of recommendations. The major goal of the IN is flexible service provision. IN Services are relatively low-level since they derive fairly directly from network capabilities. ITU-T emphasise the construction of services, not a user view (which is properly the concern of service providers). A telecommunications service generally means some network function that can be separately subscribed to and charged for. This interpretation of service is thus more operational than technical. A servic [...] ...|$|E

When there are too more incoming services to SCP and MSCs in the WIN simultaneously than they can handle will cause the SCP or MSCs overload and degrades the performance of the WIN. To resolve this problem, we introduce a queue model, design an overload control model and put forward a two-level overload control algorithm for the WIN. The results of our analysis and experiments show that our overload control algorithm is effective...|$|R

40|$|In {{future generations}} of {{wireless}} networks, {{it is expected that}} different users with various multi-homed personal wireless devices will have the option of accessing their desired services via a range of different available radio access networks. Given the variability of the radio environment properties and user mobility, the availability and characteristics of an access network will change in time and are highly dependent on location. As a result, dynamic reselection of the access network will be a necessary part of the mobility management mechanism (which maintains the session connectivity as the user moves and/or the available access characteristics change). In their selection of a radio access network customers will consider cost and perceptual quality preferences for the current application and will rely on <b>intelligent</b> <b>network</b> selection decision strategies to aid or automate their choice. These dynamic selection strategies will need to take into account different dynamic, and sometimes conflicting, metrics including: price, local <b>network</b> <b>capabilities</b> and performance, application requirements, user preferences and context, and the mobile terminal capabilities.

40|$|The <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> {{architecture}} {{is an extension}} of the existing telephone network architecture to provide centralised definition and control of services. This architecture allows enormous flexibility in introduction of new services, and allows customers to define and control their own services with a large degree of independence from network providers. This thesis is concerned with systematic modelling and analysis <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks</b> and <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> services. There is a significant body of prior art on queueing network modelling of the signalling networks and switching equipment which comprise <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks.</b> The first part of the dissertation defines a scheme for systematically translating <b>intelligent</b> <b>network</b> service definitions into parameters for such queueing network models. A representation syntax for services is defined for this purpose, and the steps required to translate a service to analysable form are defined with the aid of this syntax. The second part of the dissertation extends existing queueing network analysis techniques to obtain certain performance measures which are important in the analysis of <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks,</b> and which are lacking in previous work. In particular, the calculation of completion time distributions for entire call set-ups, as opposed delays at individual devices, is calculated. Telecommunications switches may use simple priority-based approaches to preserve throughput under congestion conditions. Such measures have previously been observed to cause oscillatory behaviour in voice switches, through a mechanism known as 2 ̆ 2 traffic synchronisation 2 ̆ 2. Similar behaviour is observed in a seemingly straight-forward model of a signalling <b>network</b> supporting <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> transactions. This is investigated fully in the third part of this thesis. Traffic synchronisation in <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks</b> leads to connection establishment delays significantly greater than those predicted by standard queueing analysis techniques. A n analysis technique quantifying these delays is developed and validated by comparison with simulations. The trade-off between prevention of traffic synchronisation at normal loads and preserving throughput at overloads is also considered. A congestion avoidance technique which prevents traffic synchronisation at little performance cost is described and analysed...|$|R
