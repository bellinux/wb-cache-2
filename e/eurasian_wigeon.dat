500|$|Holkham National Nature Reserve is England's largest {{national}} {{nature reserve}} (NNR). It {{is on the}} Norfolk coast between Burnham Overy Staithe and Blakeney, and is managed by Natural England {{with the cooperation of}} the Holkham Estate. Its [...] comprise a wide range of habitats, including grazing marsh, woodland, salt marsh, sand dunes and foreshore. The reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the larger area is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a World Biosphere Reserve. Holkham NNR is important for its wintering wildfowl, especially pink-footed geese, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon</b> and brant geese, but it also has breeding waders, and attracts many migrating birds in autumn. A number of scarce invertebrates and plants {{can be found in the}} dunes, and the reserve is one of the only two sites in the UK to have an antlion colony.|$|E
500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon,</b> brent geese and common teal, while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|E
50|$|The many water {{birds and}} other coastal avians, that have their {{hatching}} grounds on Sylt {{or use the}} island for resting on their migrations constitute an ornithological feature. There are two notable hatching areas on Sylt, the Königshafen bay with the small island Uthörn {{in the north and}} the Rantum basin in the southeast. Birds that hatch on Sylt include black-headed gull, Arctic tern, pied avocet, common redshank, common gull, oystercatcher, northern lapwing, common shelduck and tufted duck. During the migration, Sylt is a resting spot for thousands of brent geese and shelducks, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeons</b> and common eiders, as well as bar-tailed godwits, red knots, dunlins and Eurasian golden plovers. Ringed plover, common snipe, ruff and other species are less common visitors to the island.|$|R
40|$|Wild {{birds have}} {{been implicated in}} the {{expansion}} of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) outbreaks across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa (in addition to traditional transmission by infected poultry, contaminated equipment, and people). Such a role would require wild birds to excrete virus {{in the absence of}} debilitating disease. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, we found that tufted ducks, Eurasian pochards, and mallards excreted signifi-cantly more virus than common teals, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeons,</b> and gadwalls; yet only tufted ducks and, to a lesser degree, pochards became ill or died. These fi ndings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) and that others, particularly tufted ducks, are more likely to act as sentinels...|$|R
40|$|Pleasant weather {{greeted the}} 70 people who {{attended}} part {{or all of}} the 1985 Fall Field Day, at the 4 -H Camp at Halsey National Forest, 5 and 6 October. There was a slide show Friday night and the official tally Sunday noon, but other than the scheduled meals, {{the rest of the time}} was free for individual birding. The committee on a records committee completed its work and presented its report to the directors. The report was accepted and Tanya Bray, Ruth Green, and Wayne Mollhoff were appointed to 3 -year terms on the committee, Alice Kenitz and Barbara Padelford for 2 year terms, and R. G. Cortelyou and Gary Lingle to 1 -year terms. The Red-necked Grebe reported by Bill Garthright and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Wigeons</b> reported by Alice Kenitz were selected as the best birds reported for the period. It was decided that a discount of $. 50 be given for memberships and subscriptions for subsequent years paid for with the current year’s payment. The number of species seen on the Forest or immediately adjacent was 72 (it was 81 last year), but 17 (marked *) were recorded off the Forest, but in its general vicinity by parties coming in from the east, or by a couple of parties that went up toward Purdham, one of which went up to the lakes in Brown County. The low count on the Forest may have been due to a snowfall the previous weekend. The snow had disappeared before the Field Day...|$|R
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon</b> (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including black-headed gull, European herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common tern and common redshank. Skylark, meadow pipit and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short sward on which wintering wildfowl (especially <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon</b> and the pink-footed goose) depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site. A group of volunteers led by the local Wildfowlers Association carries out much of the valuable maintenance work on the reserve.|$|E
2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar-headed goose, ruddy shelduck, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon,</b> common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, common pochard, brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.|$|E

Smaller wildfowl present in winter include <b>wigeon,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is a major}} {{transition}} area for migratory birds crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and as such is a good birdwatching area. Twenty bird species regularly winter here, while 200 species are reported as migratory birds. There are 25 species of waterfowl, such as geese and flamingoes, which are common sights. Some of the common species of birds reported are Bermuda white-eyed vireo, cattle egret, great egret, snowy egret, American black duck, ring-necked duck, American <b>wigeon,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> teal and blue-winged teal. There are also waders, coots, moorhens, and great blue, green and tricolored herons. During the spring season longtails, or white-tailed tropicbirds, are a common sight. Shorebirds include various shanks, dowitchers and sandpipers. Eastern mosquitofish occur in large numbers, helping with mosquito control and providing food for the herons. White-tailed tropicbirds are reported to nest on the coastal cliffs.|$|R

40|$|Since 2003, highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus subtype H 5 N 1 outbreaks {{have been reported}} in Southeast Asia causing high mortality in poultry and have also been found to cross the species barrier infecting human and other mammalian species. Thailand is one of the countries severely affected by the HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks. After the first fatal HPAI H 5 N 1 infections were reported in tigers and leopards that had been fed carcasses of infected chickens in a zoo in Thailand, the viruses involved were characterized and studies about the pathogenesis of the disease in these large felids were performed. Since July 2005, HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses have also been detected in Europe and Africa. Migratory birds were suspected to have carried and spread these viruses from Asia. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, tufted ducks, Eurasian pochards, and mallards excreted significantly more virus than common teals, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeons,</b> and gadwalls; yet only tufted ducks and, to a lesser degree, pochards became ill or died. These findings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of HPAI H 5 N 1 and that others, particularly tufted ducks, are more likely to act as sentinels. Surveillance studies performed during HPAI H 5 N 1 epidemics in Thailand from 2004 to 2007 provided important epidemiological data. A retrospective analysis was performed to study spatial distribution, temporal analysis and the relationship associated between H 5 N 1 virus outbreaks in poultry flocks and wild birds using a non-homogeneous birth and death statistical model. Transmission efficiency among poultry flocks was 1. 7 times higher, in regions with infected wild birds in the given or preceding month. Presence of wild birds may contribute consistently to the spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus among poultry flocks. During the widespread outbreaks in Thailand, H 5 N 1 viruses also caused clinical signs and mortality in many of wild birds species. To study the phylogenetic relationship between the HPAI H 5 N 1 virus isolates from poultry and wild birds, a molecular characterization study of the HA and NA genes was carried out to reveal any differences between strains found in different host species. To control pandemic influenza A virus outbreaks, vaccination is a recommended and often effective strategy. A database and repository of the recombinant viruses {{that can be used for}} vaccine production, diagnostic and research purposes would be extremely valuable for this purpose. To this end, recombinant influenza A viruses, containing one of the 16 HA subtypes and one of the nine NA subtypes of the Eurasian lineages were produced in a A/PR/ 8 / 34 backbone using reverse genetic techniques. The outbreak of HPAI H 5 N 1 causes disease and fatality among avian and mammalian species. As the establishing the diagnosis still constitutes a major challenge, there is a need for adequate information on the possibilities to diagnose the disease in diseased and dead animals. A comprehensive overview was made of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus induced clinical signs and pathology from both natural and experimental studies in different animals and was to provide a practical guide for collecting the appropriate samples to establish the diagnosis HPAI H 5 N 1 in these animals...|$|R
50|$|A {{fieldwork}} {{study at}} Hyo-ko Waterfowl Park, a nature preserve in Niigata, Japan, found what they presumed {{was a male}} hybrid of a falcated duck and a <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon.</b> They have found these “wild” hybrids in several instances {{over the past few}} years. These birds shared morphological traits with both species. Still, most of the traits favored the falcated duck. It was reported that these hybrid birds have joined courting parties of Eurasian widgeon and even attempted to compete with widgeon males. Grunt-whistling, and burping calls being the method of inciting courtship, even resemble that of the falcated duck and not of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wigeon.</b> The hybrid bird most be closely watched, was quite sexually active, however, it is not yet known if they can reproduce with either of the female species. Hybridization between two different species often leaves the offspring sterile, but this genus shows a surprising amount of hybrid fertility.
