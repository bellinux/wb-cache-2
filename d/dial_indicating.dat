50|$|Early clock dials did not {{indicate}} minutes and seconds. A clock with a <b>dial</b> <b>indicating</b> minutes was illustrated in a 1475 manuscript by Paulus Almanus, and some 15th-century clocks in Germany indicated minutes and seconds.An early record of a seconds hand on a clock dates back to about 1560 on a clock now in the Fremersdorf collection.|$|E
50|$|The LA Series Aircraft DF {{receiver}} was {{an independent}} crystal-controlled receiver designed for permanent installation into an aircraft. The LA system integrates with the aircraft's radio stack, and utilizes {{a set of}} external antennas. The unit has two dials on the face; one <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> signal strength and the other <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> signal direction (comparable to the receive and DF modes on the LH-16, respectively). Production of these units is now discontinued.|$|R
25|$|The Callippic dial is {{the left}} {{secondary}} upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The Callippic cycle is four Metonic cycles, {{and so this}} <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.|$|R

50|$|Since the sun's {{altitude}} is {{the same}} at times equally spaced about noon (e.g., 9am and 3pm), the user had to {{know whether it was}} morning or afternoon. At, say, 3:00 pm, that isn't a problem. But when the <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> a time 15 minutes from noon, the user likely won't have a way of distinguishing 11:45 from 12:15.|$|R
5000|$|This late seventeenth-century clock also {{functions}} as a barometer; the [...] "two doors on {{the rear of the}} clock open to reveal a glass tube containing mercury and a float to which thread is attached."

50|$|The <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> {{the tides}} at Lier, Belgium. The biggest ship and the flag without the {{streamer}} indicate high water. When the streamer {{is above the}} flag it is flood. It is ebb when the streamer is below the flag. At Lier, the water is rising for 3 hours and 53 minutes and falling in the other hours. This dial completes almost two revolutions a day.|$|R

50|$|The sun {{indicator}} or hand {{gives an}} approximate indication {{of both the}} sun's azimuth and altitude. For azimuth (bearing from North), {{the top of the}} <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> South, and the two VI points of the dial East and West. For altitude, the top is the zenith and the two VI and VI points define the horizon. (This is for the astronomical clocks designed for use in the northern hemisphere.) This interpretation is most accurate at the equinoxes, of course.|$|R

5000|$|The vehicle's unique {{instrument}} panel has no tachometer. Instead {{it has a}} power reserve <b>dial</b> that <b>indicates</b> {{how much of the}} engine's power is not being used and available to the driver.|$|R
25|$|The glyphs show {{whether the}} {{designated}} eclipse is solar or lunar, {{and give the}} day of the month and hour; obviously, solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour. In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros <b>dial</b> <b>indicate</b> {{the start of a new}} full moon cycle. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.|$|R

50|$|The LH-16 has {{the ability}} to switch between two modes: DF and Receive. In DF mode, the {{direction}} of the needle on the <b>dial</b> <b>indicates</b> the direction the operator needs to turn in order to face the direction of the signal. For example, if the operator needs to turn to the right to face the signal, the needle will point to the right, and if the operator is facing the signal, the needle will be centered. Care needs to be taken in this mode to ensure that one is not facing the opposite direction of the signal, as in this case the needle will also be centered. In Receive mode, the needle indicates signal strength 90 degrees {{to the left of the}} device. Either or both modes may be used in operating this device, depending upon operator's preference and the needs of the search. Often, the operator will use DF to find two options for signal, and receive to find out which of the two directions the operator needs to follow.|$|R

50|$|The bevel {{protractor}} {{is used to}} establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The {{bevel protractor}} consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the <b>dial</b> <b>indicated</b> by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as <b>indicated</b> on the <b>dial</b> from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{water vapour}} intercomparison effort, {{involving}} airborne and ground-based water vapour lidar systems and mesoscale models, {{was carried out}} in the framework of the international HyMeX (Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment) dedicated to the hydrological cycle and related high-impact events. Within HyMeX, a major field campaign was dedicated to heavy precipitation and flash flood events from 5 September to 6 November 2012. The 2 month field campaign took place over the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea and its surrounding coastal regions in France, Italy, and Spain. The main objective of this work is to provide accurate error estimates for the lidar systems i. e. the ground-based Raman lidar BASIL and the CNRS DIAL Leandre 2 on board the ATR 42, as well as use BASIL data to validate mesoscale model results from the MESO NH and Arome WMED. The effort will benefit from the few dedicated ATR 42 flights in the frame of the EUFAR Project "WaLiTemp". In the present work our attention was focused on two specific case studies: 13 September and 2 October in the altitude region 0. 5 - 5. 5 km. Comparisons between the ground-based Raman lidar BASIL and the airborne CNRS <b>DIAL</b> <b>indicate</b> a mean relative bias between the two sensors of 6. 5 %, while comparisons between BASIL and CNRS DIAL vs. the radiosondes indicate a bias of 2. 6 and - 3. 5 %, respectively. The bias of BASIL vs. the ATR insitu sensor indicate a bias of - 20. 4 %. Specific attention will also be dedicated to the WALI/BASIL intercomparison effort which took place in Candillargues on 30 October 2012. Specific results from this intercomparison effort and from the intercomparison between BASIL and Meso-NH/AROME-WMed will be illustrated and discussed at the Conference...|$|R
