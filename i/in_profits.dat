They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as they forgot to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited about the idea. However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline <b>in</b> <b>profits.</b> Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to part with THQ.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} release the film earned $33.6 million in North American theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office), {{generating}} approximately $74.7 million in box office sales. Outside of North America, it earned $32.5 million in rentals (about $72.2 million at the box office) for a worldwide total of $66.1 million in rental earnings, roughly equivalent to $146.9 million in box office receipts. It was the fastest-grossing film {{as well as the}} highest-grossing film of 1959, in the process becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all-time (at that time) behind Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur saved MGM from financial disaster, making a profit of $20,409,000 on its initial release, and another $10.1 million <b>in</b> <b>profits</b> when re-released in 1969. By 1989, Ben-Hur had earned $90 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.|$|E

There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based The Big Issue, which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD <b>in</b> <b>profits,</b> but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{competitors}} soon {{entered the}} market as well, shipping ice by sea to both Calcutta and Bombay, further increasing demand there and driving {{out most of the}} indigenous ice dealers. A grand ice house was built from stone in Calcutta by the local British community to store the ice imports. Small shipments of chilled fruit and dairy products began to be sent out with the ice, achieving high prices. Attempts were made by Italian traders to introduce ice from the Alps into Calcutta, but Tudor repeated his monopolistic techniques from the Caribbean, driving them and many others out of the market. Calcutta remained a particularly profitable market for ice for many years; Tudor alone made more than $220,000 ($4,700,000) <b>in</b> <b>profits</b> between 1833 and 1850.|$|E

5|$|Bob Ayling's {{leadership}} {{led to a}} {{cost savings}} of £750m {{and the establishment of}} a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop <b>in</b> <b>profits</b> in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became {{the chief executive officer of}} British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.|$|E
5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million <b>in</b> <b>profits</b> from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline <b>in</b> <b>profits.</b> At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more <b>in</b> <b>profits,</b> as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
