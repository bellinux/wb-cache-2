40|$|Background: The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) {{based on}} a {{comprehensive}} geriatric assessment has been developed to predict mortality in hospitalized elderly patients. The Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) Study is an observational prospective cohort study of 1, 364 outpatients evaluated at the Cognitive Impairment Center in Treviso, Italy from 2000 to January 2010. Objective: To use the MPI in the TREDEM outpatient setting to assess the correlation of MPI with mortality and hospitalizations for acute cases that occurred after the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Methods: MPI was consecutively applied to the last 340 of 1, 364 outpatients who were evaluated at the Center from 2008 to January 2010, after the first publication of MPI index in 2008. Participants' mortality was verified by linking the cohort with Registries of Municipalities, National Register of Revenue Authorities, and Nominal Register of Causes of Death. Data about hospitalizations for acute cases that occurred within 12 months after the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> were obtained from all Italian hospitals. A Cox regression method was used to investigate the effect of MPI upon mortality and hospitalizations, also considering confounder factors such as age and gender. Results: 114 men and 226 women, aged 52. 1 - 99 years (mean age 80. 4 years), were studied and had an MPI mean of 0. 41.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} nursing assessment documentation {{practices in}} aged care organizations and {{to evaluate the}} quality of electronic versus paper-based documentation <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective nursing documentation audit study. Study samples were 2299 paper-based and 6997 electronic resident assessment forms contained in 159 paper-based and 249 electronic resident nursing records, respectively, from three aged care organizations. The practice <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment</b> documentation in participating aged care homes was described. Three attributes of quality <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment</b> documentation were evaluated: format and structure, process, and content by seven measures: quantity, completeness, timeliness comprehensiveness, frequencies of documentation specific to care domains and data items, and whether assessment forms were signed and dated. Results: Varying practice in documentation <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment</b> was found among different aged care organizations and homes. Electronic resident records contained higher numbers and more comprehensive resident assessment forms than paper-based records. The frequency of documentation was higher in electronic than in paper-based records in relation to most care domains. There {{was no difference between}} the two types of documentation systems on other aspects <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment</b> documentation (overall completeness and timeliness, variation of frequencies among different care domains, and item completion in personal hygiene assessment forms). Conclusions: Electronic nursing documentation systems could improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in the aspects of quantity, comprehensiveness and signing and <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> forms. Further studies are needed to understand the factors leading to the variations of practice and the limitations <b>of</b> nursing <b>assessment</b> documentation and to evaluate documentation quality from a clinical perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) {{has become}} the most popular form of peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) in Australia; however few studies on nutritional status in PD patients have separated APD from CAPD. Therefore the purpose was to assess the nutritional status, oral intake and self rated Quality of Life (QoL) in PD patients and compare between CAPD and APD. 10 adult CAPD and 37 APD patients on home-based peritoneal dialysis for ≥ 3 months had anthropometry measured, nutritional intake calculated from three day food diaries, and Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) completed. QoL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF- 36) questionnaire. Overall 48. 9 % (n= 23) were classified as well nourished, 44. 7 % (n= 21) were mild or moderately undernourished, and 6. 4 % (n= 3) were severely undernourished. The proportion of PD patients with energy and protein intake below evidence based guideline targets was 90. 2 % (n= 37) and 70. 7 % (n= 29), respectively. 25. 5 % (n= 12) of patients lost weight and 59. 6 % (n= 28) gained weight from initiation of therapy until <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Average quality of life score was 50. 4 ± 18. 7. QoL was correlated with PG-SGA (R 2 = 0. 298, p< 0. 01) with adjustment for age, gender, and length of time on PD.

Readiness of the facilities is essential to provide all the basic and comprehensive signal {{functions for}} EmONC to ensure emergency services from the designated facilities. The study assessed population coverage and availability of EmONC services {{in public and private}} facilities in Bangladesh. An assessment was conducted in all the public and private facilities providing obstetric care in to in-patients 24 districts. Data were collected on the performance of signal functions for EmONC from the study facilities {{in the last three months}} prior to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Trained data-collectors interviewed the facility managers and key service providers, along with review of records, using contextualized tools. Population coverage of signal functions was assessed by estimating the number of facilities providing the signal functions for EmONC compared to the United Nations requirements. Availability was assessed in terms of the proportion of facilities providing the services by type of facilities and by district. Caesarean section (CS) delivery and blood transfusion (BT) services (the two major components of comprehensive EmONC) were respectively available in 6. 4 (0. 9 public and 5. 5 private) and 5. 6 (1. 3 public and 4. 3 private) facilities per 500, 000 population. The signal functions for basic EmONC, except two (parental anticonvulsants and assisted vaginal delivery), were available in a minimum of 5 facilities (public and private sectors combined) per 500, 000 population. A major inter-district variation in the availability of signal functions was observed in each public- and private-sector facility. Among the various types of facilities, only the public medical college hospitals had all the signal functions. The situation was poor in other public facilities at the district and sub-district levels as well as in private facilities. In the public sector, CS delivery and BT services were available in the minimum required number of facilities. However, to ensure basic EmONC services, participation of the private sector is necessary. Public-private partnership should be promoted for nationwide coverage of signal functions for EmONC in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommends}} exclusive breastfeeding {{during the}} first six months of life for optimal growth. However, the rapid growth of early infancy is limited by undernutrition, and this has been assumed rare. Nonetheless, there has been reported evidence of this problem, particularly in infants with underlying disease. Identifying infants at the risk of undernutrition using growth charts is simple, quick, invaluable, but suggested ineffective. The possible cause is poor health staff understanding, application and interpretation of growth patterns in early infancy, particularly in developing countries. In Nigeria, little is known about patterns of growth, how growth velocity relate to nutritional status, standardised methods for assessing nutrition risk, and prevalence of undernutrition in infants younger than 6 months, particularly hospitalised infants. Therefore, this project based at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu, set out to answer the following research questions: 1) What is the prevalence of undernutrition in infants younger than 6 months, particularly hospitalised infants? 2) What are the implicated feeding patterns and medical conditions of these infants? 3) Can feeding information and growth patterns be used to predict undernutrition in these infants? 4) Is health staff use of growth patterns in identifying undernutrition in early infancy effective? Methods: Data were collected for the project’s three cross-sectional, observational studies. 1) Feeding information from birth to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> was collected from mothers/carers of healthy infants attending the Infant Welfare Clinic (IWC) of the UNTH, Enugu. Their retrospective weight measurements at birth, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months were documented from their mother-held Road-to-Health (RTH) growth charts. 2) Feeding and growth information was collected from infants at admission (from birth to 26 weeks of age) to the Hospital Wards of the UNTH. These data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire based on the Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA); including anthropometric measures of weight, length, head circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, and skinfolds (triceps and subscapular). 3) Paediatric Health Staff were surveyed in two teaching hospitals and four government-controlled primary health facilities using a structured self-completion questionnaire to: - determine how growth charts are used to detect childhood undernutrition - determine the accuracy in plotting and rating/applying/interpreting weight gain patterns shown on the RTH and WHO growth charts for appropriate action - test the understanding of growth trajectories displayed on charts. Results: Infant Welfare Clinic Study: The retrospective weights of 411 healthy infants (0 – 26 weeks old) attending the IWC of the UNTH, Enugu was compiled and used to generate a reference to compare that of their hospitalised peers in the same hospital. There was a steady weight gain increase in the first half and slower gain in the latter half of first six months of life.

Both parts used data from the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Center?s database. Data were retrieved for all service users 65 years or older who had home care between 2003 and 2013; these data {{are based on the}} Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care. The variables used in the analyses included: TBI, depression, demographics, neurological conditions and history of falling. For the descriptive component, comparisons of characteristics were made between service users who did and did not sustain a TBI using odds ratios (OR). The ten-year trend of annual cumulative incidence and standardized incidence rates were assessed using regression. For the etiologic component, incident TBI cases were matched to four controls by age, sex and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Crude OR?s were determined for the association between depression and TBI. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders and identify effect modifiers. Multivariable estimates were stratified by history of falling. A total of 554, 313 service users were included, of which 5215 (0. 9 %) had a TBI and 39, 048 (7. 0 %) had depression. Characteristics associated with TBI were: male sex (OR: 1. 54, 95 % CI: 1. 45, 1. 62), aboriginal origin (OR: 1. 98; 95 % CI: 1. 57, 2. 50), increasing age (OR: 1. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 09, 1. 35 for 70 - 74; up to OR: 2. 31, 95 % CI: 2. 05, 2. 59 for > 90; referent group 65 - 69), being widowed (OR: 1. 59, 95 % CI: 1. 41, 1. 80), having a history of one or more falls (OR: 2. 31, 95 % CI: 2. 19, 2. 44), the use of antidepressants (OR: 1. 49, 95 % CI: 1. 40, 1. 59) and the presence of depression (OR: 1. 57, 95 % CI: 1. 43, 1. 71), dementia (OR: 1. 65, 95 % CI: 1. 54, 1. 76), hemiplegia (OR: 4. 34, 95 % CI: 3. 88, 4. 85), multiple sclerosis (OR: 3. 19, 95 % CI: 2. 49, 4. 08) and parkinsonism (OR: 1. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 07, 1. 38). Incidence was significantly higher than previously reported figures in the general population. There was a decrease in the annual cumulative incidence over the ten-year period. Female standardized rates decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) in a linear fashion while male and overall decreased in a non-linear fashion. The crude OR for the association between depression and TBI was 1. 54 (95 % CI: 1. 43, 1. 64). Stratified analyses indicated that the association was significantly different for those with a history of falling (OR: 1. 45, 95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 73) and those without a history of falling (OR: 1. 19, 95 % CI: 0. 99, 1. 42). Multivariable analysis suggested that there were three significant effect modifiers for the exposure: history of falling, level of education and Alzheimer?s. As the level of education increased, the association between depression and TBI became smaller (OR: 1. 88, 95 % CI: 1. 30, 2. 70 for 8 th grade or less compared to OR: 1. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 78, 1. 65 for graduate degree). Service users with a TBI had greater odds of having a history of falling (OR: 1. 45, 95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 73) and being diagnosed with Alzheimer?s Disease (OR: 1. 18, 95 % CI: 1. 05, 1. 32).

40|$|Tax {{administration}} sections {{have always}} formed {{part of the}} tax legislation in South Africa. South Africans have been warned for years of the introduction of separate legislation to govern the tax administration sections of all the applicable tax Acts. This became a reality {{with the introduction of}} the Tax Administration Act (TAAct) on 1 October 2012. This study will focus on the changes from the Income Tax Act to the Tax Administration Act in relation to assessments, objections, penalties and interest. All the different types <b>of</b> <b>assessments</b> have now been defined under the Tax Administration Act. We also see the introduction of a new type <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> in the form <b>of</b> a jeopardy <b>assessment.</b> This type <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> can be raised by a senior SARS official where the Commissioner is satisfied that the collection of taxes may be in jeopardy. The biggest change regarding objections is the change to the timeframe in which a taxpayer is allowed to lodge an objection. Under the Tax Administration Act, an objection has to be lodged within 30 business days after the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assessment</b> and not within 30 business days after the due date as under the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, SARS will now be obliged to provide taxpayers with detailed reasons for assessments. The administrative non-compliance penalties that formed part of the Income Tax Act have now been combined under one chapter in the Tax Administration Act. The biggest change with regard to penalties {{can be seen in the}} movement from the additional tax penalty (old 200 % penalties) to the new understatement penalty. Taxpayers will need to ensure that they are aware of the possible implications they may face under the Tax Administration Act. It has now become even more important for taxpayers to seek the advice of qualified tax practitioners when faced with complex tax matters. This will assist the taxpayer in preventing unwanted penalties being raised and would ensure compliance in respect of their tax affairs.

It deals with the types of infridgement of personal rights which can occur in the health care service, and subsequently, it describes the systems under which the immaterial damage is reimbursed. Concurrently, I focus on the way of determination of the monetary compensation of the immaterial damage, the amount of monetary compensation actually awarded under Czech law and I evaluate adequacy of such compensation. This thesis is divided into four chapters. Chapter One provides theoretical grounds {{for the rest of the}} text, a specification of essential terms and definitions which shall be used in the text later. Chapter Two deals with one of the systems of compensation for immaterial [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} system called OBUS is described. This system is helpful {{in many ways}} in obstetric sonography: measurement of fetal parameters, calculation of gestational age and weight from measurements {{as well as from}} clinical <b>dates,</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> fetal growth, generation. of examination reports, patient file management, and retrieval of reports. The timeconsuming nature of these tasks, the reliance on quantitation, and the stylized, yet detailed nature of the reports make them particularly suited for automation. The system has been accepted by ultrasonographers performing approximately 40 obstetric examinations a day. Because of its ease of use, manpower savings, and low cost, OBUS has proved to be highly costeffective...|$|R

This book gives the reader an up to <b>date</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the current status of knowledge about tax havens through an unprecedented synthesis of mater-ial, and poses questions that will at once challenge and fascinate economic geographers. By framing tax havens and contemporary financial globalization with new insights from a range of sources and investigation methods, the authors have produced a book at home on the shelves of undergraduates, graduates and researchers alike. Central to the author’s argument are the dynamic and multiple capa...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, Congress has enacted two {{important}} laws relating to assessment work. One is Public Law 85 - 876 (Sept. 2, 1958), allowing assessment credit for expenditures covering performance of {{certain types of}} technological survey work. The other is Public Law 85 - 736 (Aug. 23, 1958), changing the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assessment</b> year. In themselves, both laws are readily understandable. Unfortunately,-however I their enactment at a time wheh prospectors were still bewildered by Public Law 167 (July 23, 1955), and its maze of procedural requirements, resulted in confused interpretations {{on the part of}} many. For this reason an attempt has been made here to clarify the problem by summarizing and discuss-ing assessment regulations. History: Federal laws governing the rights of a discoverer with respect to mineral resources on the public domain were first enacted on a comprehensive scale by Congress on May 10, 1872. These laws included requirements for the performance <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> work as a condition for the holding of unpatented mining claims. Few changes {{have been made in the}} original statutes dealing with assessment. For this reason present-day assessment regulations represent the original law as it has been extended, modified, and clarified by years of judicial rul ings. The original law has been tested to the extent that conflicting interpretations have been explored quite thoroughly and resolved to the point wherein the finer details are now defined by a mul ti tude of court decisions. Original Law: The portion of the original 1872 statutes deal ing with assessment requirements (Sectio...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, {{rates of}} HIV {{infection}} are highest among {{black men who}} have sex with men (BMSM). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective form of HIV prevention, but the uptake of this strategy has been slow since FDA approval in 2012, and it is unknown whether information about PrEP is reaching BMSM. Four hundred and thirty-six BMSM in Atlanta, GA were surveyed from January 2012 (6 months prior to PrEP approval) to March 2014 (20 months after approval). Analyses revealed no association between <b>date</b> <b>of</b> survey <b>assessment</b> and awareness <b>of</b> PrEP (20. 5 % were aware of PrEP before approval and 23. 4 % were aware after approval; OR= 0. 99 [0. 98 ? 1. 02], p= 0. 952). In a multivariate model, BMSM unaware of PrEP reported lower rates of HIV testing knowledge, fewer experiences with HIV testing, and higher rates of transactional sex than BMSM who were aware of PrEP. Our findings suggest that there is limited understanding of PrEP and that there is considerable groundwork that needs to be achieved in order to reap the full benefits of PrEP. The current findings call attention to the need to both prioritize and better understand how to strengthen the bridge between medical advances and community uptake...|$|R
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 6 months post <b>date</b> <b>of</b> publicationAn <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> {{antitumor}} immunity versus autoimmunity as {{provoked by}} the specific depletion of FOXP 3 (+) Tregs {{is now possible}} {{with the development of}} Foxp 3 -diphtheria toxin receptor-like transgenic mouse models. We have used the poorly immunogenic B 16 F 10 melanoma model to characterize a very heterogeneous antitumor effect of the immune response induced by Treg depletion. Depletion and neutralization studies demonstrated the importance of host T cells and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in mediating the antitumor response developing in Treg-depleted mice. Such a response correlated with increased proliferation of granzyme B-and IFN. -producing T cells in the tumor. Furthermore, enhanced antitumor immunity modulated the expression of MHC Class I molecules by B 16 F 10 melanoma cells in Treg-depleted mice. Since Foxp 3 (+) Treg depletion induced a significantly heterogeneous antitumor response, {{for the first time we}} were able to assess antitumor immunity and autoimmunity across different groups of responding mice. Strikingly, the duration of the tumor-immune system interaction provoked in individual Treg-depleted mice positively correlated with their propensity to develop vitiligo. A rapid complete tumor rejection was not associated with the development of autoimmunity, however, a proportion of mice that suppressed, but did not effectively clear, B 16 F 10 melanoma did develop vitiligo. The significant implication is that approaches that combine with Treg depletion to rapidly reject tumors may also diminish autoimmune toxicities. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|On {{red grouse}} estates in the UK the {{nematode}} parasite Trichostrongylus tenuis is often controlled by application of grit medicated with the anthelmintic fenbendazole (FBZ). To <b>date,</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the efficacy has been inhibited by {{the inability to}} quantify uptake of FBZ by the birds. We have developed a simple and sensitive HPLC-MS-MS method for detecting and quantifying FBZ and its metabolites from a 300 mg sample of red grouse liver. This method {{could be used to}} improve the efficacy of medicated grit treatment by allowing the identification of conditions and application methods that optimize the uptake of FBZ. With the necessary modifications, our method will also be applicable to other wildlife species where self-medication is used for parasite control...|$|R
