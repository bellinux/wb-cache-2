For example, census counts are rather straightforward in a statistical sense since it is a straight count of bodies, purchases, opinions, actions. But it is expensive to interview everybody. And there are many non-census topics requiring further study which the agency is asked to do. One way to reduce costs <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> smaller samples which hopefully represent the population being studied. This is a highly cost-effective way to get accurate information. Choosing a good sample sometimes requires complex statistical work {{to make sure the}} sample is, indeed, truly representative of the population under study. If conditions do not permit representative sampling but known benchmark statistics are known (possibly from earlier census data), it's still possible to generate accurate information by weighting the data to distort it back, so to speak, to compensate for the distortion caused by the unrepresentative sample. For example, suppose an area of Wellington has a known percentage of women—say 53% -- which is believed to be accurate from a previous census count; a study is done a few years later; a sample is chosen; questionnaires are processed; but of the returning questionnaires, 57% are women. It's possible statistically to give men slightly greater weight to account for the discrepancy, and the result is more accurate data. The agency discusses different methodologies on its website. A statement explains why weighting is sometimes necessary: [...] "Statistics New Zealand is improving the methodology used for the 2001 Household Economic Survey through the use of integrated weighting. This is a relatively recently developed method of adjusting the statistical output of a survey to match population benchmarks. In particular, it takes account of undercoverage in the survey of specified population groups. Integrated weighting improves the robustness and accuracy of survey estimates. It also reduces the effect of bias in estimates resulting from undercoverage, as well as reducing the level of sampling error for benchmark variables." ...|$|E

Sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and space.

The easiest way this may be calculated <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> a location and calculating the mean sea level at that point {{and use it as}} a datum.

The greater the bacterial concentration the greater the fermentation yield would be (fermentation yield is ratio of bacterial concentration to mass of substrate) The bacterial concentration can be measured by monitoring the turbidity, wet or dry weight, or residual nutrient concentration. After the inoculant is ready then it gets transferred in a fermentor where oxygen and temperature most be highly monitored {{for the survival of}} the microbes and it can vary depending on the microbe that is being used. After enough time has passed for the microbes to be properly incubated the product is ready to be extracted purified and packaged.|$|E

To increase the bandwidth of compact shorted microstrip antenna, thicker air substrate is used. While designing shorted circular microstrip antenna, frequency formulations used in for conventional circular microstrip antenna on thinner substrate, gives closer approximation. However design formulations to realize shorted compact circular microstrip antenna on thicker substrate over wide range of frequencies are not available. In this paper, an artificial neural network model to predict the shorted circular patch radius in shorted 900 Sectoral microstrip antenna for varying frequencies and substrate thickness is proposed.

40|$|Clustering is an {{important}} data mining task. Data mining often concerns large and high-dimensional data but unfortunately most of the clustering algorithms in the literature are sensitive to largeness or high-dimensionality or both. Di erent features a ect clusters di erently, some are important for clusters while others may hinder the clustering task. An e cient wayof handling it <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> a subset of important features. It helps in nding clusters e ciently, understanding the data better and reducing data size for e cient storage, collection and processing. The task of nding original important features for unsupervised data is largely untouched. Traditional feature selection algorithms work only for supervised data where class information is available. For unsupervised data, without class information, often principal components (PCs) are used, but PCs still require all features {{and they may be}} di cult to understand. Our approach: rst features are ranked according to their importance on clustering and then a subset of important features are selected. For large data we use a scalable method using sampling. Empirical evaluation shows the e ectiveness and scalability of our approach for benchmark and synthetic data sets...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} {{behavioral}} specialization in {{a swarm of}} autonomous robots. In the studied swarm, robots have to carry out tasks of different types that appear stochastically {{in time and space}} in a given environment. We consider a setting in which a robot working repeatedly on tasks of the same type improves its performance on them due to learning. Robots can exploit learning by adapting their task selection behavior, that <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> with higher probability tasks of the type on which they have improved their performance. This adaptation of behavior is called behavioral specialization. We employ a simple task allocation strategy that allows a swarm of robots to behaviorally specialize. We study the influence of different environmental parameters on the performance of the swarm and show that the swarm can exploit learning successfully. However, there is a trade-off between the benefits and the costs of specialization. We study this trade-off in multiple experiments using different swarm sizes. Our experimental results indicate that spatiality has a major influence on {{the costs and benefits of}} specialization. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|International audienceDisease {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors driving both natural and {{artificial}} selection. It is a particularly important and increasing threat to the managed honeybee colonies, which are vital in crop pollination. Artificial selection for disease-resistant honeybee genotypes has previously only been carried out at the colony-level, that is, by using queens or males reared from colonies that show resistance. However, honeybee queens mate with many males and so each colony consists of multiple patrilines that will vary in heritable traits, such as disease resistance. Here, we investigate whether response to artificial selection for a key resistance mechanism, hygienic behaviour, can be improved using multi-level selection, that <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> not only among colonies as normal but also among patrilines within colonies. Highly hygienic colonies were identified (between-colony selection), and the specific patrilines within them responsible for most hygienic behaviour were determined using observation hives. Queens reared from these hygienic patrilines (within-colony selection) were identified using DNA microsatellite analysis of a wing-tip tissue sample and then mated to drones from a third highly hygienic colony. The resulting colonies headed by queens from hygienic patrilines showed approximately double the level of hygienic behaviour of colonies headed by sister queens from non-hygienic patrilines. The results show that multi-level selection can significantly improve the success of honeybee breeding programs...|$|E

This study is conducted by applying experimental phonetic approach that <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> imperative sentences Tutup pintu! ‘Close the door! ’ {{as a target}} sentence. The data are collected by asking a subject to commend and to repeat the same com-mand to a child or someone who is {{of the same age}} of his child to close the door. All collected data are measured in terms of its frequency, intensity, and duration. Those three features are then analyzed statistically to find out the significance differences of acoustic feature difference on every level of utterance emphaticity. The results of this study shows that frequency, intensity, and duration are significant markers which dif-ferentiate emphaticity level. In terms of frequency, the higher the emphaticity level of the utterance is, the higher the frequency of the base pitch, final pitch, and pitch range of that utterance will be. From the sound intensity point of view, the emphaticity of utterance is marked by base intensity and intensity range. The utterance with high emphaticity level is marked by high base intensity and wider range intensity. From duration point of view, the utterance emphaticity is marked by the duration of all vow-els. The height of emphaticity level is marked by the length of time needed by the vowels to be uttered. The emphaticity markers show meaningful correlation...|$|E
40|$|Background: NK {{cells are}} {{key players in}} anti tumor immune response, which can be {{employed}} in cell-based therapeutic modalities. One of the suggested ways to amplify their anti tumor effect, especially {{in the field of}} stem cell transplantation, <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> donor/recipient mismatches in specific HLA, to reduce the inhibitory effect of killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs). Here we suggest an alternative approach for augmentation of anti tumor effect of allogeneic NK cells, which is founded on profile matching of donor NK lysis receptors (NKLR) phenotype with tumor lysis-ligands. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that an NKLR-mediated killing directly correlates with the NKLR expression intensity on NK cells. Considerable donor variability in the expression of CD 16, NKp 46, NKG 2 D and NKp 30 on circulating NK cells, combined with the stability of phenotype in several independently performed tests over two months, indicates that NKLR-guided selection of donors is feasible. As a proof of concept, we show that melanoma cells are dominantly recognized by three NKLRs: NKG 2 D, NKp 30 and NKp 44. Notably, the expression of NKp 30 on circulating NK cells among metastatic melanoma patients was significantly decreased, which diminishes their ability to kill melanoma cells. Ex vivo expansion of NK cells results not only in increased amount of cells but also in a consistently superior and predictable expression of NKG 2 D, NKp 30 and NKp 44. Moreover, expanded NK cultures with high expression of NKG 2 D or NKp 30 were mostly derived from the corresponding NKG 2 Dhigh or NK 30 high donors. These NK cultures subsequently displayed an improved cytotoxic activit...|$|E
