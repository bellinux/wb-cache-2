25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>outflow).</b> The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} swash-ground water {{interactions}} have given prominance to infiltration of swash and backwash into unsaturated sand {{as the principal}} mechanism explaining sedimentation patterns in the inter-tidal zone. Here we consider the role of fluidisation in explaining such sedimentation patterns. It appears that fluidisation due to general <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>outflow</b> from a beach is insufficient to induce fluidisation of surface sand. We propose a different mechanism for explaining fluidisation whereby very small amounts of swash infiltration into the seepage face cause rapid increases in pore water pressure below the beach surface. During the backwash, pressure unloading on the surface causes rapid <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> <b>outflow</b> from the surface sediment. The rate of this outflow is shown, using a simple model, to be sufficient to induce fluidisation. We also consider a model of general beach ground water behaviour and conclude {{that it can be}} satisfactorily used to provide boundary conditions for smaller scale models of fluidisation under swash. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> flow was {{investigated}} at Clear Lake, a 1468 -ha glacial lake in north-central Iowa, {{as part of}} a comprehensive water quality study. A multiscale approach, consisting of seepage meters (and a potentiomanometer), Darcy’s law, and an analytic element (AE) model, was used to estimate <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inflow to and outflow from the lake. Estimates from the three methods disagreed. Seepage meters recorded a median-specific discharge of 0. 25 lm/s, which produced a lake inflow rate between 90, 750 and 138, 200 m 3 /d, but no detectable outflow. A wave-induced Bernoulli effect probably compromised both inflow and outflow measurements. Darcy’s law was applied to 11 zones around the lake, producing inflow and outflow values of 10, 500 and 5000 m 3 /d, respectively. The AE model, GFLOW, coupled with the parameter estimation model, UCODE, simulated <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in a 700 -km 2 region using 31 hydraulic head and base flow measurements as calibration targets. The model produced <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inflow and <b>outflow</b> rates of 14, 300 and 9200 m 3 /d, respectively. Although not a substitute for field data, the model’s ability to simulate <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow to the lake and the region, estimate uncertainty for model parameters, and calculate a lake stage and associated lake water balance makes it a powerful tool for water quality management and an attractive alternative to the traditional methods of ground water/lake investigation...|$|R
