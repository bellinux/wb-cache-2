The base of the system consists of sliding blocks resting on sliding <b>foundation</b> <b>raft.</b> The rigid-friction force-deformation behaviour of the sliding blocks is modelled as elasto-plastic with very high initial stiffness. The {{response of}} the system is analyzed under different parametric variations to investigate the effectiveness of the sliding support. The parameter includes: eccentricity of superstructure, uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio, mass ratio and coefficient of friction of sliding support. The effectiveness is studied by obtaining the response with and without consideration of interaction between the two lateral frictional resistances of the sliding support on the criterion of sliding. It was shown that the effect of bi-direction interaction is significant and should be included for the effective design of a torsionally coupled system with sliding support. Copyright (C) 1996...|$|E

A two kilometers causeway construction was built which is situated on the soft clay layer. In order to investigate the behavior of causeway embankment, a full-scale test was conducted of high embankment built on a soft clay deposit. The embankment with 3, 5 m high was supported by two types of reinforcement such as raft and raftaggregate column foundation.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the reuse and the optimum design of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> using numerical analysis. The solution proposed for reusing foundations is {{the design of}} a piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> capable of supporting successive buildings. A <b>raft</b> <b>foundation,</b> with a limited number of piles located strategically beneath the raft and utilising a high proportion of the ultimate load capacity, is considered the most efficient design when the <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> alone provides sufficient load capacity, {{but at the same time}} settlements are excessive. This is the case in high plasticity stiff clays such as London Clay. When building on old piles, these piles had to sustain a certain load from the previous structure over a period of time, during which the soil is subjected to the time-related processes of consolidation and creep. A time dependent constitutive model, capable of reproducing several aspects of the time dependent behaviour of soils including creep and isotach viscosity, is employed in the finite element analyses. The model parameters are calibrated with the results of laboratory tests on London Clay, whose time dependent behaviour in its natural state is characterised by isotach viscosity, rate dependent peak strength and rate independent critical state line. Preliminary analyses of single piles indicate that the consolidation processes in the ground result in little gain in capacity in the long term, whereas creep results in increased capacity. A back-analysis of documented piled load tests in London Clay is performed, where the effects of pile installation are quantified. Numerical model calibration is performed with the documented observations of a well instrumented piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> at Stonebridge Park, London. 3 D parametric analyses of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> are then performed, in order to assess the appropriate location and dimensions of piles and raft thickness. The performance of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> with time is assessed parametrically at different levels of preloading.

The numerical analysis {{was carried out in}} two case studies with three typical load intensities of the serviceability load. The first case study investigates the raft-pile-soil interaction in sandy soil. The second case study examines the raft-pile-soil interaction in soft clay. Finally, the behaviours of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> in two different case studies are assessed and conclusions are made. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe Neolithic site of Monte Revincu {{is located}} in the north of Corsica, between Bastia (30 km west) and the “Agriates desert” (east). The {{researches}} yielded fifty installations structured with domestic or funerary vocation, spread on 10 000 m². Most of them relate to the last third of the fifth millennium BC. Thirty are bounded by vertical flagstones. They contain levels of stone <b>foundation</b> <b>rafts,</b> blocking structure or holes for posts, subdivisions and are interpreted as domestic units. Ten structures, among which 3 dolmens with corridor and at least 4 chests, refer to a funerary use. The collected data enable us to interpret this neolithic village, its links with the emergence of megalithic funerary monuments and to estimate the territory exploited in synchrony. This work finally provides a new image of the Corsican megalithism which seems {{to be one of the}} first area of emergence for the Western Mediterranean megalithism, in accordance with Catalonia and the Atlantic coast...|$|R
