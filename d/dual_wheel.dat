5000|$|Development of {{the naval}} trainer, called the Su-27KUB (Russian for [...] "Korabyelny Uchebno-Boyevoy" [...] - [...] "Shipborne Trainer-Combat"), began in 1989. The aim was to produce an {{airframe}} with dual roles for the Navy and Air Force suitable {{for a range of}} other missions such as reconnaissance, aerial refuelling, maritime strike and jamming. This concept then evolved into the Su-27IB (Su-34 [...] "Fullback") for the Soviet Air Force. The naval trainer had a revised forward fuselage to accommodate a side-by-side cockpit seating arrangement with crew access via a ladder in the nose-wheel under carriage and enlarged canards, stabilisers, fins and rudders. The wings had extra ordnance hard-points and the fold position was also moved further outboard. The inlets were fixed and did not feature FOD suppression hardware. The central fuselage was strengthened to accommodate 45 t maximum gross weight and internal volume was increased by 30%. This first prototype, the T-10V-1, flew in April 1990 conducting aerial refuelling trials and simulated carrier landing approaches on the Tbilisi.

40|$|The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{was used}} in many fields of {{engineering}} with the advanced of computers programs, and in lasts years have begun to evaluate pavements structures. In the transition at different structures of pavement, {{the behavior of the}} materials has resulted in the differential settlement response when they are loaded.

50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|R
50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> while {{single or}} <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used for}} the cargo trailer.

The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an axle set off the roadway.

40|$|Most design {{methods for}} road {{pavements}} require the design traffic, {{based on the}} transformation of the traffic spectrum, to be calculated into a number of equivalent passages of a standard axle using the equivalent axle load factors. Generally, these factors only consider the type of axle (single, tandem or tridem), but they do not consider the type of wheel on the axles, i. e., single or <b>dual</b> <b>wheel.</b> The type of wheel has an important influence on the calculation of the design traffic. The existing design methods assume that the equivalent axle load factors are valid for all pavement structures and do not consider the thickness and stiffness of the pavement layers. This paper presents the results of the development of a model for the calculation of the equivalent axle load factors considering the type of axle, the type of wheel and the constitution of the pavement. The model was developed based on the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} asphalt layer that is responsible for bottom-up cracking in asphalt pavement, which is the most widely considered distress mode for flexible road pavements.

40|$|Compaction is a {{big problem}} in {{agriculture}} today since it has negative effects on both yield and environment. The change in the environment caused by compaction will mean decreased quality of atmosphere, surface- and ground water and soil resources. It is therefore very important to know how different agricultural practices and technical solutions of machinery affect the soil and its functions in order to be ab 1 e to decrease the negative effects from farming. Three field experiments were carried out during the autumn 200 l. Vertical soil displacement and vertical soil stress was measured at 15, 30 and 50 cm depth in three different tractor comparisons; wheel- and tracked tractor, single and <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> and pulling and non pulling tractor. For the pull and the track experiments macroporosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were also measured. Calculations of the vertical soil stress were also made. For the single- <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> experiment a John Deere 4640 with single wheel and a wheel load of 2500 kg and a Steiger with dual wheels and a wheel load of 2200 kg were used. Both tractors had 60 kPa tyre inflation pressure. The John Deere was also used, together with a cultivator, for the pull experiment. These two experiments were carried out at Staby Säteri, Uppland. The experiment with a tracked vehicle was carried out at Krenkerup Gods, Lolland, Danmark with a rubber tracked tractor weighing 18, 5 tons and a wheel tractor weighing 9, 7 tons. The tracked tractor was balanced before comparing it to the wheeled tractor to get the weight distribution as even as possible. Vertical soil stress and vertical soil displacement right under the wheels of the single and dual wheels did not differ significantly. The soil stress was lowest between the <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> at 15 cm depth but ii was evenly distributed under the wheels at 50 cm depth. No {{significant differences were found between}} a non pulling and a pulling tractor regarding vertical soil stress and soil displacement. There was however a tendency that the saturated hydraulic conductivity was lowest after the pass of a pulling tractor. It is possible that a higher pull would have affected the soil more. The soil stress was higher at 15 and 30 cm depth for the wheeled compared to the tracked tractor. There were no significant differences in soil displacement, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density but there was a tendency that the bulk density was higher for the tracked than for the wheeled tractor. The most important conclusions were: (1) The two tyres in a <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> arrangement acted as two separate wheels which makes it more relevant to talk about wheelload than axle 1 oad regarding the risk for subsoil compaction. This is a very important result because the recommendation today is to avoid an axle load over 6 tons. (2) Even for a well balanced tracked tractor the maximum soil stress will be considerably higher than the theoretically calculated. In spite of these problems and a higher total weight, a tracked tractor can have a smaller impact on the soil than a wheeled tractor. (3) The model calculations correlated well with the measured values in the subsoil but not in the topsoil!. A better approximation for the ground pressure than the tyre inflation pressure is however' needed since the ground pressure of ten was as much as twice as high as the tyre inflation pressure...|$|E

This paper quantitatively demonstrates how the failure mode of jointed concrete pavements can be transverse, corner, or longitudinal cracking, originating at either the top or bottom of the slab.

40|$|Mechanistic {{analysis}} of jointed concrete pavements {{has traditionally been}} performed by analyzing the pavements under either traffic loading or combined environmental and traffic loading.

40|$|The large {{majority}} of New Zealand's road network is constructed from thin surfaced unbound flexible pavements where a granular layer provides the main structural strength of the pavement. The current New Zealand empirical design theory states that permanent deformation should largely {{be attributed to the}} subgrade and that shape loss in the granular layers is simply a consequence of a previously deformed subgrade. However, recent research and field trials have indicated that basecourse shear strains may be a large contributor to rutting in unbound granular layers. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the shear strains induced under heavy vehicle loads can be accurately measured using in-situ induction coils and whether the shear strains are related to permanent pavement deformation. In this investigation a rosette configuration of free floating induction coils was designed to measure principal basecourse shear strains. The principal strains were then used to construct Mohr's circle of strain in order to calculate the maximum shear strain occurring in the granular layer. The rosettes were installed in two full scale test pavements at the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF). The pavements were loaded with an 8 tonne <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> axle load for 1 million and 600, 000 load applications respectively and strain and rut depth testing occurred periodically throughout the test life. The research showed that the rosette coil arrangement was a feasible and accurate device for measuring in-situ shear strains in granular pavement layers. Finite element modelling confirmed the accuracy of the system. The results from the two CAPTIF pavements showed that there was a strong linear relationship between the magnitude of the basecourse shear strain and the rut depth {{at the end of the}} post construction compaction period. The investigation also showed that shear strain magnitudes in the region of 5000 µƐ result in rapid shear failure in the granular layer. In addition, after the post construction compaction period had finished, the rate of change of shear strain was proportional to the rate of change of rut development. The results indicated that there was approximately a 4 : 1 ratio between the rate of change in rut depth and the rate of change in shear strain after the initial post construction period. Investigations into the effect of load magnitude on the magnitude of the basecourse shear strain showed that a linear relationship existed between the two parameters. Further to this, load location testing revealed that for a <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, 50 mm of lateral wheel variation either side of a point of interest was the maximum allowable movement that would result in similar strain measurements. The research highlighted the dominance of the longitudinal tensile strain and shear strain over the vertical compressive strain within granular layers. As a result, these pavement responses should be considered in further granular pavement research in addition to the commonly used vertical compressive strains...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the feasibility of}} damage detection in asphalt pavements by embedded fiber optics as a new non-destructive inspection technique. The distributed fiber optic sensing technology based on the Rayleigh scattering {{was used in this}} study. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows to measure strains over a long length of fiber optic with a high spatial resolution, less than 1 cm. By comparing strain profiles measured at different times, an attempt was made to link strain changes with the appearance of damage (cracking) in the pavement. This non-destructive method was evaluated on accelerated pavement testing facility, in a bituminous pavement. In our experimentation, the optical fibers were placed {{near the bottom of the}} asphalt layer. The application of 728, 000 heavy vehicle loads (65 kN <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> loads) was simulated in the experiment. Optical fiber measurements were made at regular intervals and surface cracking of the pavement was surveyed. After some traffic, a significant increase of strains was detected by the optical fibers at different points in the pavement structure, before any damage was visible. Later, cracking developed in the zones where the strain profiles were modified, thus indicating a clear relationship between the increased strains and crack initiation. These first tests demonstrate that distributed fiber optic sensors based on Rayleigh scattering can be used to detect crack initiation and propagation in pavements, by monitoring strain profiles in the bituminous layer...|$|E

40|$|A {{recurring}} question is: "What effects will art {{increase in}} the sizes of tires and axleloads have on pavements? " Concern has mounted {{in regard to the}} so-called "drop-axle " not having <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> or proportioned loading. Presently, {{there seems to be a}} trend toward wide tires in lieu of <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> The wide tires first appeared on the front (steering) axle. This trend seemingly represents an attempt to respect the statutory limit of 600 pounds of load per inch of tire width but to violate the axleload or wheel-load limits (KRS 189. 222). Whereas a dual-wheeled, single, rear axle having 10 -inch wide tires would be limited to a gross load of 20, 000 pounds, 600 pounds per inch of tire width would be 24, 000 pounds. A tandem set of axles (8 tires) is limited to a gross of 34, 000 pounds; 600 pounds would be 48, 000 pounds. An advantage is demonstrated clearly when it is shown that a 34, 000 -pound, tandem axle is not any more damaging than a 18, 000 -pound, single axle having <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> A great disadvantage arises when a single axle without duals (such as the steering axle or "drop-axle") is loaded heavily without increasing the width of the tires.
