5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand {{depicted}} the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer narrative that greatly embellished {{the history of}} the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in {{the history of the}} Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.|$|E
5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|In 1988–89, the Flames {{continued}} to improve. They captured their second consecutive presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points {{better than the}} second-place Kings in the Smythe Division. Fletcher {{continued to}} tinker with the roster, acquiring Doug Gilmour {{as part of a}} six player deal at the trade deadline. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks. They relied on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon, including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime. The save remains a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in Flames history.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bosworth Field (or Battle of Bosworth) was {{the last}} {{significant}} battle of the Wars of the Roses, the civil war between the Houses of Lancaster and York that raged across England {{in the latter half}} of the 15th century. Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, by his victory became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty. His opponent, Richard III, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, making it a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> of English and Welsh history.|$|E
5|$|The hit is {{regarded}} as the <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> of Martinez's 18-year Major League Baseball career. Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus' call of the play—which is equally memorable to Seattle fans as the play itself—is also regarded as the highlight of his career. The play is also credited with keeping a Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle, as it helped garner support for a new taxpayer-funded stadium for the Mariners. That stadium, known today as Safeco Field, opened in 1999, with the Double depicted in a mural as part of the stadium's art collection.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is {{credited}} {{as being a}} <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in Hindi cinema's box office history, {{and the beginning of}} a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in {{only a small number of}} theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years.|$|E
5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{has been}} widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from {{contemporary}} chroniclers to assemble {{an account of the}} uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt {{has been widely}} used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} first game of their Adams Division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques in {{overtime}}, the Canadiens won ten overtime games en route to the title, setting an NHL record for most consecutive overtime victories in a playoff year. As with the 1986 championship, the team was led by Roy, who won his second Conn Smythe Trophy. The <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals occurred in the second game, with less than two minutes to play and Montreal trailing the series 1–0 and the game 2–1. Attempting to gain an advantage for his team, head coach Jacques Demers called for a measurement of Los Angeles Kings forward Marty McSorley's stick. Referee Kerry Fraser determined that the blade had an illegal curve, and assessed a penalty against McSorley. Montreal scored on the power play to tie the game, and then won in overtime 3–2, to tie the series. Montreal also won Games 3 and 4 in overtime before eliminating the Kings in Game 5, 4–1. The celebration was marred by one of the worst riots in Montreal history, as fans rioted through downtown Montreal causing over $2.5million in property damage and 168 injuries.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a <b>defining</b> <b>moment</b> in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the <b>defining</b> <b>moment,</b> and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
