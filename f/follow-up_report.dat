5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> on Televisa, {{a handful of}} women {{claimed to have been}} sexually abused by Flores {{approximately}} twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition as a religious organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E
5|$|Zheng and Shuying {{returned}} to Putian where Huang Na {{was buried in}} a tomb halfway up a mountain near their house. While alive, Huang Na had asked that her surname be changed to her stepfather's, so her altar tablet bore the name Zheng Na. The couple decided to focus on raising their remaining child, with Zheng planning to pursue business opportunities in Guangzhou or Shenzhen. In January 2007, Jack Neo considered making a movie about the murder, but both families objected. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> in 2009 found that Shuying {{had given birth to}} another two children and was running a shoe distribution business in Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|Because {{a breast}} implant is a Class III medical device of limited product-life, the {{principal}} rupture-rate factors are its age and design; Nonetheless, a breast implant device can retain its mechanical integrity for decades in a woman's body. When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, {{and thus can}} be readily explanted (surgically removed). The <b>follow-up</b> <b>report,</b> Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.|$|E
25|$|In March 1962, Eric Maschwitz, the Assistant and Adviser to the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, asked Donald Wilson, the Head of the Script Department, to {{have his}} department's Survey Group prepare {{a study on the}} {{feasibility}} of the BBC producing a new science fiction television series. The report was prepared by staff members Alice Frick and Donald Bull, and delivered the following month, much to the commendation of Wilson, Maschwitz and the BBC's Assistant Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> into specific ideas for the format of such a programme was commissioned, and delivered in July. Prepared by Frick with another Script Department staff member, John Braybon, this report recommended a series dealing with time travel as being an idea particularly worthy of development.|$|E
25|$|The Goldman Sachs global {{economics}} team {{released a}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> to its initial BRIC study in 2004. The report states that in BRIC nations, {{the number of}} people with an annual income over a threshold of $3,000 will double in number within three years and reach 800 million people within a decade. This predicts a massive rise {{in the size of the}} middle class in these nations. In 2025, it is calculated that {{the number of people}} in BRIC nations earning over $15,000 may reach over 200 million people. This indicates that a huge pickup in demand will not be restricted to basic goods but impact higher-priced goods as well. According to the report, first China and then a decade later India will begin to dominate the world economy.|$|E

25|$|In its history, Preuss {{has been}} the subject of two controversies. The first arose in March 2005 when a study, {{released}} by UCSD through CREATE, concluded that students who applied to the charter school but lost out in the subsequent lottery did as well in standardized testing as students who won in the lottery and were accepted. This led to speculation that Preuss was a boutique charter school that attracted highly motivated students while leaving less-motivated students to the mainstream public schools. It also led to the criticism that the school's practices were no more progressive than any other public school. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> by CREATE found, however, that the number of college preparatory (A–G) courses and advanced placement (AP) classes taken by Preuss students was higher than the number taken by their peers who lost in the lottery.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{report for}} DEFRA, {{conducted}} following the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, found that, discounting 'exotic {{events such as}} meteorite impacts', 'in most plausible circumstances {{it is likely that}} such an event would be contained by current defences, designed to resist storm surges, for all major developed areas', however the joint occurrence of events, such as a tsunami coinciding with a storm surge, was discounted. The report did, however call for additional more detailed modelling to be carried out, recommended that the Met Office should provide a tsunami warning service, and that detection devices should be upgraded. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> indicated that, of the three likely scenarios modelled, a Lisbon-type event would pose the greatest danger, potentially resulting in a tsunami wave exceeding the 1:100 year extreme sea level at the Cornish peninsula by up to 1.4m, but being within the range elsewhere. This conclusion is markedly different from the greater heights calculated by Bryant and Haslett as having been encountered in the Bristol Channel during the 1607 Bristol Channel floods.|$|E

500|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government <b>follow-up</b> <b>report</b> concluded that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|E
