40|$|Abstract — This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} autonomous map building and exploration of an unknown environment with mobile robots. The proposed method assumes that mobile robots use occupancy grid maps as the main representation model for the built maps and a hill climbing local search algorithm for exploring the environment without any kind of human intervention. It is demonstrated that hill climbing based exploration may recover from local minima and cover completely any environment, if a topological representation of the environment is created incrementally along the mapping and exploration mission. The approach is devised for either a single mobile robot or multiple cooperative mobile robots.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an adaptive method that allows mobile robots to learn cognitive maps of indoor environments incrementally and on-line. Our approach models the environment {{by means of}} a variable-resolution partitioning that discretizes the world in perceptually homogeneous regions. The resulting model incorporates both a compact geometrical representation of the environment and a topological map of the spatial relationships between its obstacle-free areas. The efficiency of the learning process is based on the use of local memory-based techniques for partitioning and of active learning techniques for selecting the most appropriate region to be explored next. In addition, a feed-forward neural network is used to interpret sensor readings. We present experimental results obtained with two different mobile robots, namely a Nomad 200 and a Khepera. The current implementation of the method relies on the assumption that ob-stacles are parallel or perpendicular to each other. This results in variable-resolution partitionings consisting of simple rectangular partitions and reduces the complexity of treating the underlying geometrical properties.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Most major rock units and unaltered and altered {{areas in the}} study area can be discriminated on the basis of visible and near-infrared spectral reflectivity differences recorded from satellite altitude. These subtle spectral differences are detectable by digital ratioing of the MSS bands and subsequent stretching to increase the contrast to enhance spectral differences. Hydrothermally altered areas appear as anomalous color patches within the volcanic-rock areas. A map has been prepared which can be regarded as an excellent reconnaissance <b>exploration</b> <b>map,</b> for use in targeting areas for more detailed geological, geochemical, and geophysical studies. Mafic and felsic rock types are easily discriminated on the color stretched-ratio composite. The ratioing process minimizes albedo effects, leaving only the recorded characteristic spectral response. The spectra of unaltered rocks appear different from those of altered rocks, which are typically dominated by limonite and clay minerals. It seems clear that differences in spectral shape can provide a basis for discrimination of geologic material, although the relations between visible and near-infrared spectral reflectivity and mineralogical composition are not yet entirely understood...|$|E

40|$|Building {{autonomous}} robotic {{agents that}} {{interact with the}} real-world is a complex and difficult task and several distinct paradigms are used to develop such machines. In the past decade {{there has been an}} exploration of approaches inspired by evolutionary and/or neurodynamical principles. [1, 2, 3, 4]. In earlier work, we have examined architectures which support agent-based design of such robotic systems [5]. But, whilst there have been successes in developing systems that exhibit low levels of performance e. g. wall following, safe <b>exploration,</b> <b>map</b> building, it is proving more difficult to develop systems that succeed in high level tasks which depend upon machines being capable of exhibiting (many) different behaviours. One of the motivations for building autonomous robots in which the control system is designed using neurological principles is that such systems are fault tolerant, their performance degrading gradually. However, we have found that one problem with such systems is the initiation of a behaviour in an ’unintended ’ fashion. In the psychological literature, these events are called ’capture errors’; they may arise through incomplete training of neurally-based control system(s) or through ’damage ’ to the control system so that a learnt association is altered [6] (c. f. a stroke in humans) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Gene Ontology {{has become}} an {{extremely}} useful tool {{for the analysis of}} genomic data and structuring of biological knowledge. Several excellent software tools for navigating the gene ontology have been developed. However, no existing system provides an interactively expandable graph-based view of the gene ontology hierarchy. Furthermore, most existing tools are web-based or require an Internet connection, will not load local annotations files, and provide either analysis or visualization functionality, but not both. Results To address the above limitations, we have developed GOLEM (Gene Ontology Local <b>Exploration</b> <b>Map),</b> a visualization and analysis tool for focused exploration of the gene ontology graph. GOLEM allows the user to dynamically expand and focus the local graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy in the neighborhood of any chosen term. It also supports rapid analysis of an input list of genes to find enriched gene ontology terms. The GOLEM application permits the user either to utilize local gene ontology and annotations files {{in the absence of an}} Internet connection, or to access the most recent ontology and annotation information from the gene ontology webpage. GOLEM supports global and organism-specific searches by gene ontology term name, gene ontology id and gene name. Conclusion GOLEM is a useful software tool for biologists interested in visualizing the local directed acyclic graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy and searching for gene ontology terms enriched in genes of interest. It is freely available both as an application and as an applet at [URL]. </p...|$|E
40|$|NASA’s {{long term}} plans involve {{a return to}} manned moon missions, and {{eventually}} sending humans to mars. The focus of this project {{is the use of}} autonomous mobile robotics to enhance these endeavors. This research details the creation of a system of terrain classification, energy of traversal estimation and low cost path planning for teams of inexpensive and potentially expendable robots. The first stage of this project was the creation of a model which estimates the energy requirements of the traversal of varying terrain types for a six wheel rocker-bogie rover. The wheel/soil interaction model uses Shibly’s modified Bekker equations and incorporates a new simplified rocker-bogie model for estimating wheel loads. In all but a single trial the relative energy requirements for each soil type were correctly predicted by the model. A path planner for complete coverage intended to minimize energy consumption was designed and tested. It accepts as input terrain maps detailing the energy consumption required to move to each adjacent location. Exploration is performed via a cost function which determines the robot’s next move. This system was successfully tested for multiple robots by means of a shared <b>exploration</b> <b>map.</b> At peak efficiency, the energy consumed by our path planner was only 56 % that used by the best case back and forth coverage pattern. After performing a sensitivity analysis of Shibly’s equations to determine which soil parameters most affected energy consumption, a neural network terrain classifier was designed and tested. The terrain classifier defines all traversable terrain as one of three soil types and then assigns an assumed set of soil parameters. The classifier performed well over all, but had some difficulty distinguishing large rocks from sand. This work presents a system which successfully classifies terrain imagery into one of three soil types, assesses the energy requirements of terrain traversal for these soil types and plans efficient paths of complete coverage for the imaged area. While there are further efforts that can be made in all areas, the work achieves its stated goals...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the problems of <b>exploration,</b> <b>map</b> building and collision free navigation for intelligent autonomous mobile robots. The project began with an extensive review of currently available literature in the field of mobile robot research, which included intelligent control techniques and their application. It became clear that there was scope for further development with regard to map building and exploration in new and unstructured environments. Animals have an innate propensity to exhibit such abilities, and so the analogous use of artificial neural networks instead of actual neural systems was examined for use as a method of robot mapping. A simulated behaviour based mobile robot was used in conjunction with a growing cell structure neural network to map out new environments. When using the direct application of this algorithm, topological irregularities were observed to be the direct result of correlations within the input data stream. A modification to this basic system was shown to correct the problem, but further developments would be required to produce a generic solution. The mapping algorithms gained through this approach, although more similar to biological systems, are computationally inefficient in comparison to the methods which were subsequently developed. A novel mapping method was proposed based on the robot creating new location vectors, or nodes, when it exceeded a distance threshold from its mapped area. Network parameters were developed to monitor the state of growth of the network and aid the robot search process. In simulation, the combination of the novel mapping and search process were shown to be able to construct maps which could be subsequently used for collision free navigation. To develop greater insights into the control problem and to validate the simulation work the control structures were ported to a prototype mobile robot. The mobile robot was of circular construction, with a synchro-drive wheel configuration, and was equipped with eight ultrasonic distance sensors and an odometric positioning system. It was self-sufficient, incorporating all its power and computational resources. The experiments observed the effects of odometric drift and demonstrated methods of re-correction which were shown to be effective. Both the novel mapping method, and a new algorithm based on an exhaustive mesh search, were shown to be able to explore different environments and subsequently achieve collision free navigation. This was shown in all cases by monitoring the estimates in the positional error which remained within fixed bounds...|$|E
