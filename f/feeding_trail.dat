Data on Body Weight Gains (BWG), Feed Consumption (FC) and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) was recorded on weekly interval and analyzed by using multivariance test. BWG and FCR of quails were significantly (P < 0. 01) better at 6 % IPA than that of 6 % SKC in diet during the experimental period. FC was significantly lower in SKC incorporated diet than IPA. Birds fed on diets supplemented with protease (4000 U/ kg) showed significantly improved BWG, less FC, better FCR, followed by phytase (400 U/kg), and liver tonic (0. 1 %) irrespective of extraction methods.

40|$|Abstract The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different algae in diet on growth, survival, and interleukin- 10 productions of sea cucumber. At first, a 9 -week <b>feeding</b> <b>trail</b> was conducted to evaluate the growth performance and survival of the sea cucumber fed {{one of the six}} experimental diets containing ST (Sargassum thunbergii), UL (Ulva lactuca), UP (Undaria pinnatifida), LJ (Laminaria japonica), SS (Schizochytrium sp.), and NO (Nannochloropsis oculata) in a recirculating aquaculture system. The result showed that survival was not significantly different among the dietary treatments, and the specific growth rate (SGR) of sea cucumber fed the UL diet (1. 58 % d− 1) was significantly higher than that of sea cucumber fed the other diets (P <  0. 05), except for the LJ and NO diets. Secondly, interleukin (IL) - 10 gene expression was determined where mice splenocytes were stimulated with 10  μg ml− 1 of sea cucumber extracts for 2  h. The result showed that IL- 10 gene expression levels were significantly increased in UL, LJ, and NO diets fed sea cucumber extracts compared to other experimental diets. The results suggest that dietary inclusion with Ulva lactuca, Laminaria japonica, and Nannochloropsis oculata algae may improve the growth of juvenile sea cucumber and could upregulate IL- 10 gene expression in mice splenocytes.

One hundred and fifty 4 - week old female quails divided into 4 groups having 3 replicates of 12 birds each were used in this study. Four isonitrogenous (20 % CP) diets incorporating graded levels (0, 10, 20 and 30 %) of yam peel meal were compounded. The diets, however, varied in energy levels having 2, 626 (Diet A), 2, 553 (Diet B), 2, 480 Diet C and 2, 406 kcalME/kg (Diet D) respectively. Each diet was replicated three times. Average daily feed intake (34. 77, 31. 13, 31. 50 and 33. 23 g/bird) and hen-day production (30. 06, 22. 17, 18. 81 and 16. 19 %) were significantly (p 0. 05) affected. As the level of yam peel meal increased in the diet, hen-day egg production was dropping. Feed cost/kg diet (N) decreased from diet A (41. 24), B (38. 02), C (34. 52) to 31. 02 (diet D) which had a cost saving of 25 % over the control diet. By this study, it is indicated that at dietary crude protein level of 20 % and Metabolizable Energy of between 2, 480 and 2, 626 kcal/kg, 20 % level of yam peel meal inclusion in Japanese quail diet is acceptable for satisfactory egg production...|$|E
40|$|Beavers (Castor canadensis) {{can be a}} {{significant}} prey item for wolves (Canis lupus) in boreal ecosystems due to their abundance and vulnerability on land. How wolves hunt beavers in these systems is largely unknown, however, because observing predation is challenging. We inferred how wolves hunt beavers by identifying kill sites using clusters of locations from GPS-collared wolves in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. We identified 22 sites where wolves from 4 different packs killed beavers. We classified these kill sites into 8 categories based on the beaver-habitat type near which each kill occurred. Seasonal variation existed in types of kill sites as 7 of 12 (58 %) kills in the spring occurred at sites below dams and on shorelines, and 8 of 10 (80 %) kills in the fall occurred near <b>feeding</b> <b>trails</b> and canals. From these kill sites we deduced that the typical hunting strategy has 3 components: 1) waiting near areas of high beaver use (e. g., <b>feeding</b> <b>trails)</b> until a beaver comes near shore or ashore, 2) using vegetation, the dam, or other habitat features for concealment, and 3) immediately attacking the beaver, or ambushing the beaver by cutting off access to water.

A digestion trail, using six steers was conducted and treatments were: (1) maize silage; (2) forage sorghum silage. Feed intake and water intake were measured. A feeding trails using 27 forage sorghum silage. Twelve steers were allocated to treatment one while the rest were allocated to treatment two. Feed intake and weight gains were measured. Feed, weigh back, faeces and urine samples were chemically analysed using methods by AOAC (1975) and Van Soest (1963). Feed intake and digestibility coefficients data were subjected to analysis of variance. Student ‘t’ {{test was used to}} compare the means of feed chemical composition and animal performance. Dry matter content (30. 65 %; 34. 75 %), Crude protein (7. 16 %; 6. 99 %), Ether extract (4. 47 %; 3. 86 %), ASH (9. 78; 9. 23 %) and gross energy in Kcal/g (DM) (4. 07; 4. 16) were not different (P<. 05) in maize and forage sorghum silages respectively. The fibrous components were lower (P<. 01) in maize silage than in forage sorghum silage, i. e. Crude fiber (29. 25 %; 38. 05 %), Cell wall content (54. 49 %; 68. 99 %), Acid detergent fiber (37. 52 %; 48. 65 %) and Acid detergent lignin (3. 88; 5. 95 %) respectively. Silage juice for pH determination was squeezed out using cheese cloth. The pH in Maize and forage sorghum silages were 4. 04 and 4. 21 respectively. Maize silage was higher (p<. 05) in digestibilities of dry matter and energy than forage sorghum silage. Digestibilities of crude fiber, cell wall content and acid detergent fiber were higher (P< 0. 01) in maize silage than in forage sorghum silage. The lower digestibility of forage sorghum silage may have been due to its higher lignin content. Crude protein digestibility for maize (34. 17 % and forage sorghum silage (28. 17 %) were not different (P< 0. 05). Whole grain kernels were isolated from the silages as fed and also from faeces samples. Maize silage grain kernels were more digestible than forage sorghum silage whole grain kernels. In the digestion trial, forage sorghum dry matter intake (69. 76 g/w 0. 75) was higher (P< 0. 05) than for maize silage (60. 20 g/w 0. 75). The difference in dry matter intake may have been due to difference in dry matter content of the silages. In the <b>feeding</b> <b>trail</b> the dry matter intake for maize silage (79. 37 g/w 0. 75) and for forage sorghum silage (82. 17 g/w 0. 75) were not different (p<. 05).

The may have been due to group feeding effect in the <b>feeding</b> <b>trail.</b> Confinement in the digestion trail may also have caused stress, which may have lowered the feed intake. Steers on forage sorghum silage had higher (P< 0. 05) weight gains than those on maize silage. The steers used in the trial were brought from range areas and they were in poor condition.

Moreover, dietary FC treatment led to a higher (p< 0. 05) lactobacillus concentration and lower E. coli concentration than the NC treatment, whereas the antibiotic supplementation only decreased the E. coli concentration. Pigs fed FC or PC diet had reduced (p< 0. 05) fecal NH 3 and H 2 S content compared with those fed NC diet. In conclusion, our results indicated that the inclusion of FC 01 treatment could improve the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal microbial shedding (lower E. coli and higher lactobacillus), and decrease the fecal noxious gas emission in growing pigs when compared with the group fed the basal diet. In conclusion, dietary FC could be considered as a good source of supplementation in growing pigs because of its growth promoting effect...|$|E
40|$|General EcologyThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of sequestered plant toxins in aphids on the feeding rate of Chrysopidae carnea, a {{predator}} of aphids. We observed whether the difference in host plant of the aphids affected the consumption of prey by C. carnea. We conducted <b>feeding</b> <b>trails</b> with C. carnea and aphids from Asclepias syriaca and Populus balsamifera. We found that there was not a statistical difference between the consumption rates of the two species of aphids by the predator. There was also no significant difference in the carbon and nitrogen composition of the aphids. The C. carnea larvae were generalist predators that were not deterred by the chemical toxins. In this trophic system the herbivores adapted to survive the plant’s chemical defenses. Predators also suggested survival adaptations to the chemical defenses, which could lead to greater host plant viability by decreasing the population of aphids...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about two aspects of feeding by porillas which have not been {{previously}} been reported. These concern the western lowland sub-species, of which so little is yet known, even though it forms over 90 % of the world's populations of gorillas. This neglect is perhaps due {{not only to the}} threatened status of mountain gorillas in East Africa, but also to the problems of limited visibility in a tropical forest habitat where groung vegetation can be very dense. The data collected as part of the first long-term project in West Africa, which began in October 1983 in the Lope reserve in central Gabon. The study-area encompassesboth forest and savanna (figure 1), thus providing an unusual combination of habitats(as 85 % of Gabon is forested), where unhabituated porillas live in sympatry with chimpanzees. The data were obtained by analysing faeces, <b>feeding</b> <b>trails,</b> and by direct observation...|$|R
50|$|The Cross River gorilla, {{like many}} other gorilla species, prefer a dense forest habitat that is {{uninhabited}} by humans. Due to the Cross River gorilla’s body size they require large and diverse areas of the forest to meet their habitat requirements. Similar to most endangered primates, their natural habitat exists where humans are often occupying and using for natural resources. Forests that are inhabited by the Cross River gorilla vary in altitude from approximately 100 to 2037 m above sea level. Between 1996 and 1999, Field work was conducted on Afi Mountain in Cross River State, Nigeria {{for a period of}} 32 months. A great deal of data were collected, and things such as habitat types and topography mapped using line transects, climate, spatial and temporal availability of tree and herb foods and also the Cross River gorilla's wide range behavior, diet, and its grouping patterns. These data were all assessed from indirect evidence, such as <b>feeding</b> <b>trails,</b> nests, and feces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} was conducted with natural ingredients and orange skin in the diet of laying pullets to determine the suitability as pigmenting agents of egg yolk for laying chicken The influence of test ingredients on production characteristics of laying pullets, internal and external quality characteristics of eggs were investigated simultaneously. The experiment covered the proximate analysis of marigold, orange skin meal to determine the nutrient concentrations, xanthophylls contents and 7 - 12 weeks <b>feeding</b> <b>trail</b> toth th investigate the yolk pigment availability of marigold and orange skin as well as laying performance of birds. Orange skin and marigold were used for comparing the pigmenting ability to normal feed containing xanthophylls. Yolk color was improved significantly as compared to control for addition of marigold and orange skin during 4, 8 and 12 weeks of supplementation. Inclusion of marigold and orange skin in theth th th diet of laying pullets did not cause deterioration in natural and external quality of eggs {{and there were no}} significant variations with respect to body weight, hen day egg production egg weight and feed conversion. There was no mortality of birds during study period. The results indicates the conclusion that between two natural ingredients marigold contain more xanthophylls (156. 32 mg/kg DM) than orange skin (83. 02 mg/kg DM) and use of 4 % marigold meal in the diet of laying pullets is enough to produce eggs with yolk color score 11. 00 close to 30 mg synthetic pigment/kg diet at the 12 week of supplementation, whereas the birds thatth received 4 % orange skin in the diet were able to produce eggs with yolk color score 5. 0. Moreover, use of marigold and orange skin in diet of pullet has no detrimental effect on internal and external quality of egg as well as egg production characteristics. So, marigold can be used more efficiently for egg yolk pigmentation. Key words: Marigold and orange skin egg yolk, pigmenting agents, xanthophyll intak...|$|E

40|$|A <b>feeding</b> <b>trail</b> {{was carried}} out in the Organic Dairy Farm of “Haus Riswick“, Kleve, Germany between 1 st August 2002 and 31 st October 2003 in order to a) {{investigate}} the frequently asked question after the “optimal” concentrate-level in Organic Farming and b) relate the concentrate amount to potential health problems of herds associated to the change into Organic Farming. The herd was split into 2 groups of 18 cows. A high quality forage ration was fed to both groups which allowed maintenance plus 19 kg of ECM production on average, which was composed of grass and maize silage in winter, and additional pasture in summer time. The Control-Group (C) received concentrates according to their milk yield, but was not given more than 8 kg/d. The Experimental-Group (E) was fed 3 kg extra concentrates mixed with the forage ration, but did not receive more than 11 kg/d of concentrates in total. Therefore differences between the groups occurred in the first weeks of lactation and in the end of lactation. In 305 -day-lactation the C-Group consumed 1600 kg concentrates and the E-Group consumed 2200 kg per cow per year. The results showed a large difference between the seasons. During summer, when cows had access to pasture (half-day), the milk yield was not different between the groups, although the E-Group consumed on average 1, 5 kg DM concentrates more than the C-Group. In winter the E-Group produced about 4 kg ECM more than the C-Group. During winter the E-Group consumed 2 kg DM/d concentrates more, which was utilized for milk production. Protein-content in milk showed no differences, fat-content was slightly higher for the C-Group throughout the trial. The results also showed that especially in the first 100 days of lactation the differences between the groups were the largest. The BCS was sufficient during the first 200 days of lactation, even though it was below the optimal score. After 200 days the BCS dropped under the sufficient level, but when cows calved again the BCS was on a sufficient status again. That means that in the last weeks of lactation and in the dry-off period the cows again gained condition...|$|E
50|$|Most dugongs do not feed from lush areas, {{but where}} the {{seagrass}} is more sparse. Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect {{the value of a}} seagrass bed. The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass is important, and the grass species most often eaten are low in fibre, high in nitrogen, and easily digestible. In the Great Barrier Reef, dugongs feed on low-fibre high-nitrogen seagrass such as Halophila and Halodule, so as to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating. Seagrasses of a lower seral are preferred, where the area has not fully vegetated. Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption, due to the dugong's highly specialised diet. There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels. Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass. <b>Feeding</b> <b>trails</b> have been observed as deep as 33 m, and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as 37 m. Dugongs are relatively slow moving, swimming at around 10 km/h. When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins.|$|R

Average snow depths and hardness indexes were at or below values identified by previous authors as critical upper limits to caribou activity...|$|R
40|$|In southeastern Kansas, the Middle Pennsylvanian (Desmoinesian) Bandera Shale {{consists}} of sandstone, shale, limestone, and coal deposited between two carbonate formations, the underlying Pawnee Limestone and the overlying Altamont Limestone. Isopach maps and cross sections {{indicate that the}} Bandera Shale thickens southeastward towards the Oklahoma and Missouri borders. Analysis of gamma-ray-log signatures, augmented by neutron-log signatures, indicates that the Bandera Shale is rich in mudstone, with sandstones limited to intervals ranging from 10 ft to 30 ft (3 – 9. 1 m) in thickness. Comparisons with previously studied cored and logged siliciclastic portions of overlying Missourian lithologies suggest that the Bandera Shale {{consists of}} various proportions of sandstone, siltstone, clay-rich shale, and calcite-cemented sandstone. Exposures of the Bandera Shale in Bourbon County, Kansas, consist of interbedded shale and calcite-cemented, fine-grained sandstone. Sandstone beds, ranging from 3 cm to 20 cm (1. 2 – 7. 9 in) in thickness, are, in places, rhythmically laminated with organic-rich and organic-poor lamina forming 2 -mm (0. 8 -in) -thick couplets. Many sandstone bedding surfaces in the lower and middle portion of the Bandera Shale are bioturbated with horizontal <b>feeding</b> <b>trails</b> and some vertical burrows that sugges...|$|R
