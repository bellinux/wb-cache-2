5|$|During the 1970s, the {{population}} of the base declined due to the possible closure of the base and the <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> in personnel from the Vietnam War.

5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 16-yard line, and Casey completed a quick 14-yard pass to Purdham for a first down. But Tech was unable to gain another first down, and after four plays were stopped short, Tech turned the ball over to Miami after Casey threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Miami {{received the}} ball with 1:24 remaining and ran a series of inconsequential plays to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> the clock and bring the game to an end. Miami earned the win, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local depletion. Over the course of decades, individual wells <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers field in California since 1960.|$|E

5|$|Vashon was {{superseded}} on 26 March 1801, and {{the following}} day Captain Edward Brace arrived to take command. Neptune became the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Gambier during this period. Brace's period of command was brief, he was superseded by Captain Francis Austen on 12 September. With the <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> in hostilities prior to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, Neptune was one of the many ships of the Mediterranean fleet to be ordered home, arriving at Portsmouth on 24 February. Austen paid her off on 29 April, but recommissioned her the next day. Neptune then underwent a brief refit, during which £5,728 was expended, £2,895 of which was spent on her hull, masts and yards. Austen was superseded on 30 September 1802 {{and the following}} day Captain William O'Bryen Drury took command. With Neptune fully refitted and stored, she sailed from the dockyard and joined the Channel Fleet at Spithead on 29 October.|$|E

25|$|President {{a member}} of both the {{executive}} and legislature. Third, the President is vested with both executive authority and legislative power. As {{a member of}} the legislature, in general the President must assent to all laws passed by the legislature. However, the President has limited discretionary executive powers to withhold assent to certain bills, including attempts by the Government to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> financial reserves accumulated by past governments, to change the investment ability of the Central Provident Fund Board, and to alter the President's own discretionary powers.|$|E
25|$|When {{the entire}} platysma is in action it {{produces}} a slight wrinkling of {{the surface of the}} skin of the neck in an oblique direction. Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw; it also serves to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> the lower lip and angle of the mouth in the expression of melancholy, i.e. surprise or horror. However, the platysma plays only a minor role in depressing the lip which is primarily performed by the depressor anguli oris and the depressor labii inferioris by Dr. Hardy Franklin.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|Her last notable commanders {{as the war}} {{drew to a close}} were John Duckworth and Arthur Phillip, {{the latter}} taking her to the East Indies before {{returning}} after the conclusion of the war. Europe was then reduced to ordinary in the <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> of the navy following the end of hostilities, and was not reactivated on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. She only returned to service in 1796, recommissioning as a prison ship based at Plymouth, in which role she served out the remainder of the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars, finally being broken up in 1814.|$|E
25|$|The {{four years}} after his release from the Tower were mainly passed in retirement, but on the {{accession}} of Queen Anne, he plunged into political life again with avidity. His first act was to <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> on himself in February 1702 the censure of the House of Commons for the part which he took {{in the attempt to}} secure the return of his nominee for the borough of Malmesbury. Through the fear of the ministry that his restless spirit would drive him into opposition to its measures if he stayed at home, he was appointed early in 1705 to command an expedition to Spain, during the War of the Spanish Succession.|$|E

The development objective of the Catastrophe Development Policy Loan Deferred <b>Draw</b> <b>Down</b> Option Project for Guatemala is to enhance the Government's capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for natural disasters. This objective will be achieved by supporting policy and institutional reform in the following aspects of disaster risk management: i) improving risk identification and monitoring; ii) increasing disaster risk reduction investments; iii) strengthening institutions and planning capacity for risk management; and iv) developing risk financing strategies.|$|E
25|$|The PRT {{is about}} one-eighth {{the size of}} the overall 2,830 Canadian {{military}} forces in Afghanistan. The 2008 Manley Report recommended that the KPRT be given more funding and attention and be placed under civilian leadership instead. The KPRT was transferred to civilian command in April 2010, during the update in the US civilian surge to Kandahar, with the Representative of Canada in Kandahar Ben Rowswell as KPRT Director and former US Ambassador Bill Harris as Deputy Director. With impending Canadian <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> in 2011 and increasing number of US soldiers and civilians in Kandahar, the KPRT transitioned from Canadian to American command in late 2010, completed with the transfer of authority in early 2011 of KPRT directorship from Tim Martin to American diplomat Ben Moeling.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the U.S. Navy carrier battle group {{can be traced to}} the 1920s and was initially based on previous experience grouping battleships and other major surface combatants. In World War II, administratively, aircraft carriers were assigned to carrier divisions (CARDIVs). Operationally they were assigned to Task Forces, of which Task Force 11, Task Force 16 and Task Force 17 perhaps gained the most fame for their roles in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. The single-carrier battle group was born with the military <b>draw</b> <b>down</b> that followed World War II. Carrier Division 1 was redesignated Carrier Group 1 on 30 June 1973, and seemingly all Carrier Divisions were redesignated Carrier Groups on that date.|$|E
