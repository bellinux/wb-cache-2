40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is no {{information}} on the duration of absence of depressed Dutch workers. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms in the working population. METHODS: In this observational study of 15 % of the Dutch working population, all absence episodes (n = 9, 910) starting between April 2002 and November 2005 diagnosed as depression were selected. For these episodes, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were computed. RESULTS: The mean (and median) duration of sickness absence due to depressive symptoms was 200 (179) <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 213 (201) <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women. In both sexes, older employees had longer absence durations. Depressive symptoms had an estimated rate of chronicity (1 year of absence) of 24 %. Employees in educational and public services (232 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 242 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women), commercial services (213 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 219 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) and health care (212 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 214 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) had the longest mean duration of absence with depressive symptoms. Men in the industrial sector (189 days) had the shortest absence periods. Employees in large sized companies (188 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 208 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women) had shorter absence episodes as compared to companies with less than 75 employees (214 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> men and 226 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> women). CONCLUSIONS: Workers with depressive symptoms were absent for a long time. Explanations for the long duration are discussed. It is recommended to develop and apply tools for recognizing employees at risk for chronic depression...|$|R
