50|$|Liquid {{whistles}} are a kind {{of static}} mixer that pass fluid at high pressure through an orifice and subsequently over a blade. This subjects the fluid to high turbulent stresses and may result in mixing, emulsification, <b>deagglomeration</b> and disinfection.|$|E

50|$|High shear {{dispersers}} create intense shear {{near the}} impeller but relatively little {{flow in the}} bulk of the vessel. Such devices typically resemble circular saw blades and are rotated at high speed. Because of their shape, they have a relatively low drag coefficient and therefore require comparatively little torque to spin at high speed. High shear dispersers are used for forming emulsions (or suspensions) of immiscible liquids and solid <b>deagglomeration.</b>|$|E

50|$|The agglomeration/deagglomeration (mechanical stability) {{potentials}} {{of airborne}} engineered nanoparticle clusters also have significant influences on their size distribution profiles at the end-point of their environmental transport routes. Different aerosolization and <b>deagglomeration</b> {{systems have been}} established to test stability of nanoparticle agglomerates. For example, laboratory setups based on critical orifices {{have been used to}} apply a wide range of external shear forces onto airborne nanoparticles. After applying shear forces, the particle mean size decreased while the particle generation rate increased. In another pioneering study, four powder aerosolization systems (dustiness testing systems) were compared for the first time for their characteristics linked to aerosol generation.|$|E
50|$|It would {{therefore}} appear desirable to process a material {{in such a}} way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions. It should be noted here that a number of dispersants such as ammonium citrate (aqueous) and imidazoline or oleyl alcohol (nonaqueous) are promising solutions as possible additives for enhanced dispersion and <b>deagglomeration.</b> Monodisperse nanoparticles and colloids provide this potential.|$|E
5000|$|Very fine powders, such as {{titanium}} dioxide pigments, and materials {{that have been}} spray dried may agglomerate or form lumps during transportation and storage. Starchy materials or those that form gels when exposed to solvent can form lumps that are wetted on the outside but dry on the inside. These types of materials are not easily mixed into liquid with the types of mixers preferred for solid suspension because the agglomerate particles must be subjected to intense shear to be broken up. In some ways, <b>deagglomeration</b> of solids {{is similar to the}} blending of immiscible liquids, {{except for the fact that}} coalescence is usually not a problem. An everyday example of this type of mixing is the production of milkshakes from liquid milk and solid ice cream.

50|$|In {{industrial}} process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical {{system with the}} intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (<b>deagglomeration).</b> Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern {{industrial process}}ing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.|$|E
50|$|At a {{laboratory}} scale, mixing {{is achieved by}} magnetic stirrers or by simple hand-shaking. Sometimes mixing in laboratory vessels is more thorough and occurs faster than is possible industrially. Magnetic stir bars are radial-flow mixers that induce solid body rotation in the fluid being mixed. This is acceptable on a small scale, since the vessels are small and mixing therefore occurs rapidly (short blend time). A variety of stir bar configurations exist, {{but because of the}} small size and (typically) low viscosity of the fluid, it is possible to use one configuration for nearly all mixing tasks. The cylindrical stir bar can be used for suspension of solids, as seen in iodometry, <b>deagglomeration</b> (useful for preparation of microbiology growth medium from powders), and liquid-liquid blending. Another peculiarity of laboratory mixing is that the mixer rests {{on the bottom of the}} vessel instead of being suspended near the center. Furthermore, the vessels used for laboratory mixing are typically more widely varied than those used for industrial mixing; for instance, Erlenmeyer flasks, or Florence flasks may be used in addition to the more cylindrical beaker.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonication offers great {{potential}} in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the <b>deagglomeration</b> and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials {{as well as for}} the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to high-speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this sonochemical (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel.|$|E

Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters. After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench) scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to nanomaterial aerosols poses potential health risks to workers at nanotechnology workplaces. Understanding the mechanical stability of airborne nanoparticle agglomerates under varied mechanical forces and environmental conditions {{is important for}} estimating their emission potential and the released particle size distributions which in consequence alters their transport and human uptake probability. In this study, two aerosolization and <b>deagglomeration</b> systems were used to investigate the potential for <b>deagglomeration</b> of nanopowder aerosols with different surface hydrophilicity under a range of shear forces and relative humidity conditions. Critical orifices were employed to subject airborne agglomerates to the shear forces induced by a pressure drop.

Rising humidity decreased the <b>deagglomeration</b> tendency as expressed by larger modal particle sizes and lower number concentrations compared to dry conditions. Hydrophilic aerosols exhibited higher sensitivities to changes in humidity than hydrophobic particles. However, the test systems themselves also differed in generated particle number concentrations and size distributions, which in turn altered the responses of created aerosols to humidity changes. The {{results of the present study}} clearly demonstrate that a) humidity control is essential for dustiness and <b>deagglomeration</b> testing, b) that (industrial) <b>deagglomeration,</b> e. g. for preparation of aerosol suspensions, can be manipulated by subjecting airborne particles to external energies, and c) that the humidity of workplace air may be relevant when assessing occupational {{exposure to}} nanomaterial aerosols...|$|E

In this paper, {{for the sake of the}} industrial thixoforming and numerical simulation, microstructure and stress variation of semisolid magnesium alloys during isothermal compression is researched. Here, samples are heated to the desired temperature in the empty space with various holding times and compressed horizontally. Stress–strain curves during compression can be given directly by the experimental computer, and each of curves show a peak stress in a small strain and then decrease rapidly, which originally because of the thixotropy of semisolid materials. Moreover, thixotropy of semisolid magnesium alloys is clearer with the evolution of microstructures including agglomeration and <b>deagglomeration</b> of solid particles and the moving way of liquid at different places and strain under different conditions. Microstructures during isothermal compression show that the <b>deagglomeration</b> of solid particles increase with increasing the strain rate, therefore, the thixotropy of semisolid magnesium alloys increases. However, when solid volume fractions are lower, the agglomeration of solid particles doesn’t change obviously with increase or decrease factors, meaning that the thixotropy is smaller.
