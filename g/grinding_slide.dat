When it is {{primarily}} the board which is contacting the edge, it's called a slide; when it's the truck, it is a <b>grind.</b> <b>Grinding</b> and <b>sliding</b> skateboards started with sliding the board on parking blocks and curbs, then extended to using the coping on swimming pools, then stairway handrails, and has now been expanded to include almost every possible type of edge.|$|R
50|$|Sound in the Interface domain expresses what is {{happening}} in the game. In many video games this is sound related to activity in the HUD, such as sounds synced to health and status bars, pop-up menus and the score display. Although sound in this domain often follows ICT interface sound design conventions (abstract iconic and non-iconic signs), there are many games that intentionally try to blur the boundaries of Interface and Effect by mimicking the diegetic concept. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Interface sound instances consist of the skidding, <b>grinding</b> and <b>sliding</b> sounds of skateboards.|$|R

He struggled hard. Ian crushed him in his arms, raised him, crammed him into a chair, seized a pliant rope and bound him therewith, winding him and the chair round and round in his haste--for {{there was no time}} to tie knots--until he resembled a gigantic spool of ravelled thread.

40|$|A new {{apparatus}} for microscopic {{observation and}} tracing of cutting edges of a wheel has been developed. The {{use of this}} apparatus allows us to visually witness the behavior of abrasive grains during the grinding operation. A phase-contrast microscope, {{as well as an}} electron microscope has been used with the new apparatus in this investigation. A method of calculating effective grain spacing to show distribution of cutting edges, as well as the cutting edge ratio to known worn conditions of grains has been completed. These aforementioned values for various grinding wheels have been studied in grinding operations and the changing aspects of them have been noted. Through these experi-ments, we have had helpful suggestions about grinding mechanisms; there is no self-dressing action of grains in the usual <b>grinding</b> work; <b>sliding</b> of the cutting edges takes place in the grinding, and wear of the grinding is increased by this action...|$|R
40|$|Bruxism is {{a health}} problem {{consisting}} in grinding or tightly clenching {{the upper and}} lower teeth. Both the <b>grinding</b> and <b>sliding</b> lead to wear of the teeth and produce a noise during the night that is sufficiently loud to disturb the sleep of anyone sharing the bedroom. The tension produced causes problems in the muscles, tissues and other structures surrounding the jaw, ear pain, headaches, lesions to the teeth and disorders in the jaw joints. For an early, rapid, effective and economical diagnosis of bruxism, we propose the use of instrumented splints to detect and record the intensity and duration of inter dental pressure episodes. This paper sets out the design, manufacture and testing of an instrumented splint for diagnosing the signs of bruxism. The system stands out for its use of piezoelectric polymeric sensors which, because of their reduced thickness, do not cause any alteration to the patient’s bite. It lets a quantitative assessment of intraoral pressure be made and bruxism behavior be diagnosed at an early stage, so as to being able to programme corrective actions before irreversible dental wear appears. The first “in vitro” simulations and “in vivo “trials performed served to demonstrate the feasibility of the system in accordance with the initial objectives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{comparisons}} of performance characteristics between the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure developed in this laboratory to <b>grind</b> precisely the <b>sliding</b> {{face of a}} surface hardened workpiece with thermal spray and the conventional one are investigated by measuring the surface roughness and hardness for a SCM 440. To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by <b>grinding</b> precisely the <b>sliding</b> face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror face grinding machine using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror face grinding machine for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height. It is also found that the surface hardness of both the conventional and the super-mirror face grinding machines are increased as the particle size of diamond wheel is reduced...|$|R

Aggressive skating {{is referred to}} by participants as rollerblading, blading, skating or rolling and refers to not only the variety of maneuvers that include a variety of <b>grinds,</b> airs, cess <b>slides,</b> toe/heel rolls and other advanced skating stunts but also the equipment used. Aggressive skates are rollerblades that include aspects of the skate that facilitates grinds, this includes a plastic frame with a space in the middle for grinding, and, sole plates that allow the practitioner to grind {{on the side of}} the boot. Types of aggressive skating include Park and Street. The range of wheel size for aggressive inline skates range from 40mm to 72mm, the median ranging in the general vicinity of 53mm - 58mm.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{analytical}} {{models of}} heat transfer in grinding {{have been based}} on the sliding heat source analysed by Jaeger and Carslaw in 1942. It is now shown that for deep grinding processes, and particularly for high eYciency deep <b>grinding</b> (HEDG), the <b>sliding</b> model overestimates the temperatures experienced by the ® nished workpiece surface. These situations are re-analysed using sliding sources and inclined sources to estimate contact surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures in grinding. Convection in the abrasive contact region to the process ¯ uid, to the grinding wheel and to the chip material removed is taken into account. It is shown that each of these eVects can predominate under diVerent process conditions. Case studies illustrate the importance of thermal processes in achieving eYcient material removal. The results for HEDG are particularly interesting and suggest that under the right conditions speci ® c energy may be self-limiting. This is oVered as a possible explanation for the eYciency of the process...|$|R
25|$|The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province (sometimes {{known as}} the Stikine Volcanic Belt) is the most active {{volcanic}} region in Canada. It formed due to extensional cracking, faulting, and rifting of the North American Plate, as the Pacific Plate <b>grinds</b> and <b>slides</b> past the Queen Charlotte Fault, unlike subduction that produces the volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The region has Canada's largest volcanoes, {{much larger than the}} minor stratovolcanoes found in the Canadian portion of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. Several eruptions are known to have occurred within the last 400 years. Mount Edziza is a huge volcanic complex that erupted several times in the past several thousand years and has formed several cinder cones and lava flows. The complex comprises the Mount Edziza Plateau, a large volcanic plateau (65km long and 20km wide) made of predominantly basaltic lava flows with four large stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau. The associated lava domes and satellite cones were constructed over the past 7.5 million years during five magmatic cycles beginning with eruption of alkali basalts and ending with felsic and basaltic eruptions as late as 1,340 years ago. The blocky lava flows still maintain their original forms. Hoodoo Mountain is a tuya in northwestern British Columbia, which has had several periods of subglacial eruptions. The oldest eruptions occurred about 100,000 years ago and the most recent about 7000 years ago. Hoodoo Mountain is also considered active, so could erupt in the future. The nearby Tseax Cone and The Volcano produced some of Canada's youngest lava flows, about 150 years old.|$|R

[...] "After what had {{happened}} in England I could never go back a poor man, but a good deal is forgiven the one who comes home rich. Then, while I tried to keep my head, we came to the fault where the ore vein suddenly ran out. It broke off as though cut through with a knife, and went down, as the men who knew no better said, to the centre of the earth. Now a fault is a very curious thing, but one can deduce a good deal when he has studied them, and a big snow-slide had laid bare an interesting slice of the foundations of this country in the valley opposite. It took me a month to construct my theory, and that was little when you consider the factors I had to reckon with--ages of crushing pressure, denudation by <b>grinding</b> ice and <b>sliding</b> snow, and Titanic upheavals thousands of years ago. The result was from one point of view contemptible. With about four thousand dollars I could strike the vein again." ...|$|R
30|$|The thin {{sections}} were prepared by laying samples set in open sample trays with clean glass slides. Sample numbers were {{marked on the}} glass slide with diamond scriber. Sample number checked against the marked number on the glass slides to ensure the sample identity is correct. The samples were ground to a flat surface using only diamond abrasive with distilled water. Sample grinding was done by hand on a flat plate for the core samples. Samples that required stabilization (the side wall core samples) prior to grinding, were stabilized. Epoxy stabilization was done in a plastic using Epon 815 -diethylene-triamine. The glass slide tray was ensured to be next to the samples. The sample was allowed to cure at room temperature. Final grinding of the surface to be mounted on the glass slide was done using 400 -mesh diamond plate. Lapping was done using glass impregnated plate.  10 ×-power magnification microscopes were used in observing {{the progress of the}} <b>grinding.</b> The prepared <b>slides</b> were analyzed using petrographic microscope.|$|R
40|$|Thin {{and thick}} {{sections}} were carefully {{made by hand}} in water-free environment, to avoid damage to the soluble contents of the groundmass. The preparation was carried out using oil or kerosene as a lubricant during all stages – cutting samples, <b>grinding</b> the <b>slide</b> to correct thickness. Polishing was performed on a silk-like surface using oil-based, water-free 1 and 3 micron diamond compounds. Polished grain mounts {{have been used for}} search, microphotograph and analytical studies of melt, solid and fluid inclusions in porphyroclasts and phenocrysts. Euhedral and subhedral crystals were hand picked from crushed rocks, mounted in epoxy resin, ground using kerosene as a lubricant, polished using oil-based diamond compound and cleaned with a petroleum-based solvent such as shellite. The lapidary work was specifically done in a water-free environment in order to preserve soluble contents of exposed inclusions. For heating experiments individual grains were specially prepared. Grains with suitable melt inclusions were picked up from epoxy grain mounts by hot needle and mounted (with polished side down) on a glass plate using super glue, which is soluble in acetone. After that, the grains were gently grounded and polished using oil-based diamond compounds, washed in acetone and stored away. Most analytical studies of melt inclusions have been done on individual grains, which were mounted in small brass or alumina tubes, exposed or brought close to the surface (less than 20 µ) and then polished in water-free environment. Thermometric experiments Thermometric experiments were performed on olivine-hosted melt inclusions using a Linkam TS 1500 heating stage with visual control and the Vernadsky Institute heating stage (Sobolev et al., 1980) in an inert atmosphere of ultra-high purity argon and helium, respectively, to prevent olivine oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Background—Study of the {{vascular}} {{response to}} stent implantation has been hampered by difficulties in sectioning metal and tissue without {{distortion of the}} tissue stent interface. The metal is often removed before histochemical processing, causing a loss of arterial architecture. Histological and immunohistochemical sections should be 5  µm with an intact tissue stent interface.  Objectives—To identify the most suitable cutting and grinding equipment, embedding resin, and slides for producing thin sections of stented arteries with the stent wires in situ for histological, immunohistochemical, and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses.  Methods— 20 balloon stainless steel stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of 10  pigs. Twenty eight days later the stented arterial segments were excised, formalin fixed, embedded in five different resins (Epon 812, LR white, T 9100, T 8100, and JB 4), and sectioned with two different high speed saws and a grinder for histological, immunohistochemical, and TEM analyses. Five stented human arteries were obtained at necropsy and processed using {{the best of the}} reported methods.  Results—The Isomet precision saw and grinder/polisher unit reliably produced 5  µm sections with most embedding resins; minimum section thickness with the horizontal saw was 400  µm. Resin T 8100, a glycol methacrylate, enabled satisfactory sectioning, grinding, and histological (toluidine blue, haematoxylin and eosin, and trichromatic and polychromatic stains) and immunohistochemical analyses (α smooth muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, vimentin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and CD 68 (mac 387)). T 9100 and T 8100 embedded stented sections were suitable for ultrastructural examination with TEM. Stented human arterial sections showed preserved arterial architecture with the struts in situ.  Conclusion—This study identified the optimal methods for embedding, sawing, <b>grinding,</b> and <b>slide</b> mounting of stented arteries to achieve 5  µm sections with an intact tissue metal interface, excellent surface qualities, histological and immunohistochemical staining properties, and suitability for TEM examination. The technique is applicable to experimental and clinical specimens.    Keywords: stents;  resin;  histology;  immunohistochemistry;  transmission electron microscop...|$|R
