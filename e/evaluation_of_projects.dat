In 1991 he became Minister of Finance and Trade, and along with Financial Secretary Keith Hurst and Minister of Economic Development Rodney Williams negotiated the rescheduling of Antigua's national debt with European creditors. The government's 1992 budget, announced and drafted by Joseph, included no new taxes but did involve a cut to government spending, in response to what he claimed was reduced spending by tourists and smaller amounts of international aid in 1990 and 1991. The 1993 budget contained similar provisions, ruling {{out the possibility of}} an income tax, as suggested by one of Antigua's major trade unions. This was accompanied by a programme of fiscal reforms, including [...] "expenditure control, improved revenue collection, external debt management, proper <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> improved public sector efficiency, price controls on basic foods and commodities, tax reform and good governance".|$|E
