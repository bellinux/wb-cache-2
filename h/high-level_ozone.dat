40|$|Review {{of some of}} the {{procedures}} and results of the double monochromator and colinear photometer Nimbus- 4 satellite experiment that measures ultraviolet terrestrial radiance, Lambert reflectivity of the lower boundary of the scattering atmosphere, and extraterrestrial solar irradiance. The experiment has produced nearly three years of almost continuous data which are being used to infer the <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> distribution and total ozone on a global basis. The <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> data have been verified by independent coincident rocket ozone soundings, and the total ozone values show good agreement with Dobson spectrophotometer determinations. An increase has been observed in equatorial radiance at 2550 A relative to 2900 A, which seems to indicate that the amount of ozone in the upper stratosphere is related to the eleven-year solar cycle...|$|E
40|$|The Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) {{experiment}} {{aboard the}} Nimbus- 4 satellite is discussed. This double monochromator experiment measures ultraviolet terrestrial radiance at 12 discrete wavelengths between 2550 A and 3400 A. Approximately 100 scans covering a 230 kilometer square are made between terminator crossings on the daylight {{side of the}} earth. A colinear photometer channel with the same field of view is used to derive the Lambert reflectivity of the lower boundary of the scattering atmosphere. The extraterrestrial solar irradiance is measured at the northern terminator. The instrument has currently produced almost three years of nearly continuous data which {{are being used to}} infer the <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> distribution and total ozone on a global basis. The <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> data have been verified by independent coincident rocket ozone soundings, and the total ozone values show good agreement with Dobson spectrophotometer determinations as well as those made with the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer also on Nimbus- 4...|$|E
40|$|Manganese-iron mixed oxide, an {{efficient}} and stable catalyst, {{has been successfully}} used in the decomposition of ozone. The influence of different iron precursors on the catalytic decomposition activity of <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> under high-humidity over manganese-iron catalysts prepared using a hydrothermal approach was studied. The catalytic performance over MnFe 0. 5 Ox-Fe(NO 3) (3) was much better than that of MnFe 0. 5 Ox-FeSO 4 and MnFe 0. 5 Ox-FeCl 3. From the results of characterization by N- 2 physical adsorption, XRD, XPS and SEM, {{it was concluded that}} the largest specific surface area, the lowest crystallinity, the most evenly distributed particle size and the most surface-active Mn 2 + and Mn 3 + led to the best catalytic activity for the MnFe 0. 5 Ox-Fe(NO 3) (3) catalyst.

40|$|Respiratory {{physicians}} {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the adverse environmental effects of ground-level (trophospheric) ozone on their patients. An adverse effect of ground-level activities on <b>high-level</b> (stratosphe-ric) <b>ozone</b> is {{about to have a}} significant impact on our working activities and on our patients. We all need to und-erstand what is happening in the stratosphere, why this has happened, what action governments have taken to remedy the situation, how the pharmaceutical industry has resp-onded to an imminent chloroflurocarbon (CFC) phase-out, and what this will now mean to both physicians and pati-ents. Ozone in the stratosphere is continually produced and destroyed by physical and chemical processes. It forms a layer 20 – 40 km above the Earth's surface, where it ab...|$|R
40|$|The Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) {{experiment}} {{on board the}} Nimbus 4 polar orbiting satellite has been measuring the total <b>ozone</b> content and <b>high-level</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> profiles since early 1970. Synoptic type analyses of these data are now being accomplished and compared with appropriate constant-pressure analyses of stratospheric circulation. Ozone changes during a stratospheric warming of early 1971 are investigated by comparison with circulation changes in the layer between 30 mb (24 km) and 2 mb (42 km). A general increase in ozone concentrations, more pronounced in the higher latitudes, is noted during the warming period. Plans for future investigation are discussed, including analysis of ozone observations beginning from 1970 on every two-day basis for comparison with constant-pressure height, temperature, and wind charts analyzed {{with the aid of}} radiosonde, rocketsonde, and satellite data...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a method}} was {{developed}} to diagnose ozone episodes exceeding environmental criteria (e. g., above 80 ppb) {{on the basis of}} a multivariate statistical method and a fuzzy expert system. This method, being capable of characterizing the occurrence patterns of <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone,</b> was employed to forecast daily maximum ozone levels. The hourly data for both air pollutants and meteorological parameters, obtained both at the surface and at high elevation (500 hPa) stations of Seoul City (1989 - 1996), were analyzed using this method. Through an application of the fuzzy expert system, the data sets were classified into 8 different types for common ozone episodes. In addition, the data sets were divided into patterns of 11 (Station A), 20 (Station B), 8 (Station C), and 10 (Station D) for site-specific ozone episodes. The results of the analysis were successful in demonstrating that the method was sufficiently efficient to classify each class quantitatively with its own patterns of ozone pollution...|$|E
40|$|Statistical methods {{based on}} {{modeling}} the exceedances over a high threshold {{have emerged as}} one of the best ways to apply extreme value theory in practice. However, work on multivariate extensions- when there are several processes contributing to the extremes and we want some way of jointly modeling them- is still in a more primitive state. Nevertheless, the expansion of research on multivariate extreme value theory over the past several years (due especially to the work of J. Tawn and S. Coles) has now created a number of possibilities for developing multivariate threshold methods. In this paper, I review both univariate threshold methods and multivariate extreme value theory, and then discuss ways of putting them together. A novel point of the theory is that it suggests new ways to implement univariate threshold methods: it is possible to create models explicitly incorporating dependence by using multivariate techniques to model the joint distribution of exceedances in a time series. These results are illustrated with some examples taken from ongoing work being carried out at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, on modeling <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> exceedances as a function of time and meteorology...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} and improve the Swedish {{forecast}} and information capabilities for ground-level ozone concentrations in ambient air. The assessment {{is based on a}} set of archived results from the Swedish operational chemical transport model MATCH and Swedish in-situ measurements of ozone covering the period of May 2008 to November 2010. The evaluation comprises two major activities: The first activity is an analysis of the overall model performance using standard statistical metrics suitable for longer time series. The second evaluation activity comprises in-detail analyses of the specific ozone episodes occurring in Sweden during the study period. In addition, trajectory modelling is used to investigate the meteorological conditions and transport patterns associated with those episodes. The evaluation of the model results shows that the model scores well according to standard evaluation criteria and confirms results of other studies in that the model easily meets the data quality requirements of the EU air quality directive 2008 / 50 /EC. However, from an operational forecasting and information perspective it would be desirable to further improve the prediction of, in particular, <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> episodes. Two different activities in our study are dedicated to the task of improving the forecast and information capabilities: The first activity tests the usefulness of statistical postprocessing of model results using regression techniques. The tests show promising results although the model performance during <b>high-level</b> <b>ozone</b> episodes is not improved. A limitation of our study is the relatively small archive of model data available for calibration andevaluation. Adaptive post-processing methods have not been tested in our study. The second activity aimed to improve ozone forecasting is a high-resolution model run for the year 2010. The higher reso-lution run gives slightly better results than the coarser operational model, which can be attributed to a better resolution of the physiography and thus certain physical and chemical processes. In particular, high-resolution simulations provide a more realisticrepresentation of the spatial ozone variation which is desirable for environmental assessments with a longer time horizon. However, from the perspective of operational ozone forecasting the increase in resolution cannot correct systematic problems such as an under-prediction of ozone if the source of ozone is non-local and the long-range transboundary transport is not correctly described by the European-scale model used as boundaries. Other potential sources of error are incomplete or erroneous emissions, representativeness issues, oversimplifications in the model’s physical or chemical processes, lacking data assimilation and initialization and oversimplifiedboundary conditions. While several of these issues are already addressed in current initiatives such as the EU FP 7 -project MACC, it is clear that further work will be needed during the coming years. Further work should also be invested in a better exploitation of the international developments within MACC and in the establishment of operational high-resolution air quality forecasts for Sweden, using boundary values from European-scale forecasts provided by theMACC-ensemble of regional air quality models...|$|E
