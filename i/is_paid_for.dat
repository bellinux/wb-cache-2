5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented.

The royalty only applies to final products {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI product that is already subject to the royalty. For example, an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers <b>is</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV.|$|E
