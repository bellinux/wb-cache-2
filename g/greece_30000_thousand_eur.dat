The thermograms revealed {{failures in the}} structure {{that could not be}} noticed visually before. The walls’ structure was obtained from the project description from year 1955. In order to check the walls’ actual composition, the heat flux was measured with a thermocouple at four characteristic points of the building envelope. Thermal transmittance was calculated from the measured heat flux and compared with the thermal transmittance gained through the estimated thicknesses and physical properties of the walls’ layers. For the longitudinal thermal bridges, longitudinal thermal transmittance was calculated with a computer program THERM. The outer and inner dimensions of the building were acquired with a laser measurement. With the program Gradbena fizika URSA 4. 0, an energy performance certificate was prepared and the results were compared with the results from the energy performance certificate that already existed for the building. Taking into account that the building belongs to cultural heritage, measures for energysaving renovation were proposed, which would reduce heath losses and increase energy efficiency. In addition, measures were proposed for the use of renewable energy resources that would provide the energy required for the functioning of the building. The costs for the proposed measures were estimated. The most efficient and also the most required measure is the thermal insulation of the ceiling toward unheated attic, which was estimated to be 20 <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR.</b> The investment would be repaid in 4 years time...|$|R
40|$|The {{rising trend}} in the {{prevalence}} of obesity {{has become a major}} public health concern in many countries during the past decades, partly because being obese is associated with comorbidities and death. The cost of treatment for obesity related diseases has become a heavy burden on the national health care budget in many countries. The treatment options for obesity are mainly weight management therapies in the form of diet and exercise, pharmacological therapy, and surgery. The incidence of bariatric surgery in Sweden has increased eight-fold in the last decade. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass surgical treatments for obesity in adult patients, in comparison with conventional treatment, in Sweden from a societal perspective. The conventional treatment alternative consisted of the prevalent mixture of non-surgical obesity treatments. A model of individual patients was used to simulate the outcomes of the patients in terms of treatment costs, indirect costs, life years, and quality adjusted life years (QALY) over a lifetime perspective. In patients with a Body Mass Index of 40 - 44 kg/m 2, surgery was estimated to be cost-saving in men and judged cost-effective in women, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of SEK 26 <b>thousand</b> (<b>EUR</b> 3 <b>thousand).</b> The incremental cost associated with gastric bypass decreases with BMI, increases with the patient's age, and is higher in women than in men. Taking patient characteristics and uncertainty in input data and model design into account, the incremental cost is estimated to be at most SEK 160 thousand per QALY gained (about <b>EUR</b> 18 <b>thousand</b> per QALY). In conclusion, gastric bypass surgery appears to be a cost-effective intervention compared to conventional treatment in adult persons with obesity in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified social cost-benefit analysis approach tested on around thirty projects of small infrastructure in Croatia, and deals {{with some of}} the specific issues encountered in this field work. In Zadar and Sibenik– Knin counties, Croatia, a Sustainable Development Project funded by CARDS -Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation- was active from 2003 to 2006 for the war-affected areas. The project aimed to support the two administrations in managing local development programs through CARDS and to prepare for the pre-accession Funds. The assistance consisted in training in EU procedures, preparing grant scheme, updating the Regional Operational Program, implementing an infrastructure project pipeline. The paper focuses on the last activity, more precisely on the project appraisal for the preparation of the pipeline, and describes the experience developed in this context through a methodology commonly used for the management and evaluation of infrastructures funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds. The methodology applied for the evaluation was social cost-benefit analysis. The challenge of this experience is represented by the reference context, where either Public Administration than local actors started only recently to cope with the EU program procedures and principles, and by the chosen operative methods, made of a cooperation of International experts and professional evaluators with local personnel. Given the financial dimension of the concerned projects (from a few hundred <b>thousands</b> <b>EUR</b> to a maximum of five millions EUR, with one exception) a simplified yet rigorous version of the standard methodology has been applied. For the data collection the input came from the contribution of local actors, either the personnel of the company appointed for the management of this program than the Public Administration and the projects promoters. Surveys, personal interviews through well-structured questionnaires, printouts' desk analysis and presentation of the main results were the activities of the involved personnel. The application of a standard methodology allows a certain degree of comparability among the projects and makes it easy to horizontally read the interventions' performance. The message of the paper is that even for small infrastructure projects CBA is a tool by means of which project analysts and decision-makers could have a useful dialogue for the planning exercise.

40|$|Commercial airliners have {{continually}} voiced {{the need}} to improve the availability of their fleet and with current financial pressures facing many airlines this need has even become more significant. SHM can contribute to enhancing aircraft availability through substituting routine heavy structural maintenance inspections with automation. However, specific aircraft locations and the impact of SHM alternatives are yet to be defined. The paper presents a two stage approach centred on analysing maintenance intervals, and areas where improvements to an aircraft's availability can be achieved. This approach is explained with reference to real aircraft maintenance scenarios where critical areas are identified and the impact of implementing such technologies are assessed. The analysis requires initially sourcing information via maintenance documentation and then mapping sequences of steps from the data collected. As part of a study to highlight the approach two types of scheduled intervals were taken for analysis. Conventional DCheck (still adopted today) was modelled with a discrete event simulation tool called Arena. Savings of 3 hours per D-check interval could be realised by placing hotspot monitoring to a set of locations highlighted in the paper. This would equate to 6 hours saved over the life, which may be insufficient to justify investment in SHM technologies. It also proves that aircraft maintenance processes and damage tolerant design are well optimised from an initial design point of view and that the high degree of an aircraft disassembly required may only provide a very limited potential for SHM within the frame of current aircraft initial structural design. However aircraft structures are likely to fracture at locations other than those predicted initially. This effect is not critical from a safety point of view since those fractures are detected well before they become critical. However those damages being called the drop outs lead to specially directed inspections which are likely to fall outside of the conventional maintenance schedule and hence can become comparatively costly. The example of a 2400 FC interval only provided here has three items of which the critical item is a detailed inspection that always lies on the critical path, despite fluctuations with uncertainties. Substituting for a SHM centred process could save up to 280 hours over the aircraft life. With the cost of operation at a few <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR</b> per hour, application of SHM to drop out intervals to further optimise maintenance processes could certainly justify future investment...|$|R

40|$|Although {{weather is}} a {{significant}} determinant of agriculture production, {{it is not a}} common practice in production analysis to investigate on its direct impact on the level of final production. We assume that the problem is methodological, since it is difficult to find a proper proxy variable for weather in these models. Thus, in the common production models, the weather is often included into a set of unmeasured determinants that affects the level of final production and farmers productivity (statistical noise, random error). The aim of this dissertation is to solve this methodological issues and find the way to define weather and its impacts in a form of proxy variable, to include this variable into proper econometric model and to apply the model. The purpose of this dissertation is to get beyond the empirical knowledge and define econometric model that would quantify weather impacts as a part of mutually (un) conditioned factors of final production, to specify the model and apply it. The dissertation {{is based on the assumption}} that the method of stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) represents a potential opportunity to treat the weather as a specific (though not firm-controllable) factor of production and technical efficiency. SFA is parametric method based on econometric approach. Its starting point is the stochastic frontier production function. The method was presented in the work of Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meusen and van den Broeck (1977). Unlike commonly used econometric models, SFA is based on analysis of production frontier that is formed by deterministic production frontier function and the compound error term. The compound error term consists of two parts [...] random error (statistical noise, error term) and technical inefficiency. Technical inefficiency represents the difference in the actual level of production of the producer, and the maximum attainable (possible) level that would be achieved if the producer used a particular combination of production factors in a maximum technically efficient way. Over time, it has been developed on a number of aspects - see time variant and invariant inefficiency, heteroscedasticity, measurement and unmeasured heterogeneity. Along with the DEA, SFA has become the preferred methodology in the area of production frontier and productivity and efficiency analysis in agriculture. Lately, it has been applied for example by Bakusc, Fertő and Fogarasi (2008) Mathijs and Swinnen (2001), Hockmann and Pieniadz (2007), Bokusheva and Kumbhakar (2008) Hockmann et al. (2007), Čechura a Hockmann (2011, 2012), and Čechura et al. (2014 a, b). We assume that the weather impacts should be analysed with regard to technical efficiency, rather than as a part of statistical noise. Implementation of weather in part of deterministic production function rather than in the statistical noise {{is a significant}} change in the methodical approach within the stochastic frontier analysis. Analysis of the weather impacts on the changes in the level of TE has not been greatly recorded in the associated literature and is, therefore, considered as the main contribution of this work for the current theory of production frontier estimation, or the technological effectiveness, in the field of agriculture. Taking into account other variables that are important for the relationship and whose inclusion would enhance the explanatory power of the model was part of the objective of this work. Thus, the possible effect of heterogeneity was taken into account when models were formulated and final results discussed. The paper first defined and discussed possible ways how to incorporate the effects of the weather into production frontier model. Assessing the possibility of inclusion of weather in these models was based on the theoretical framework for the development of stochastic frontier analysis, which defines the concept of technical efficiency, distance functions theory, stochastic production function theory and the methodology and techniques that are applied within the framework of SFA, which were relevant for the purpose of this work. Then, the weather impacts on the shape and shift of production frontier and technical efficiency of czech cereal production in the years 2004 - 2011 was analyzed. The analysis was based on the assumption that there are two ways how to define variables representing weather in these models. One way is to use specific climatic data, which directly describe the state of the weather. For the purpose of this thesis, the variables mean air temperature (AVTit) and sum of precipitation (SUMPit) in the period between planting and harvest of cereals in the individual regions of Czech republic (NUTS 3) were selected. Variables were calculated from the data on monthly mean air temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation on the regional levels provided by Czech hydro-meteorological institute CHMI. Another way to define weather variable is to use a proxy variable. In this dissertation, the calculation of climatic index (KITit) was applied. Climatic index was calculated as a sum of ratios between the actual yield levels and approximated yield levels of wheat, barley and rye, weighted by the importance of each plant in a cereal production protfolio in each region of the Czech republic. Yield levels were approximated by the linear trend functions, yield and weights were calculated with the use of data on regional production and sown area under individual grains by year at the level of regional production (NUTS 3) provided by Czech Statistical Office. Both ways of weather definition are associated with some advantages and disadvantages. Particular climatic data are very precise specificatopn of the actual weather conditions, however, to capture their impacts on the level of final production, they must be implemented into model correctly along with the number of other factors, which have an impact on the level of final production. Climatic index, on the other hand, relates the weather impacts directly to the yield levels (it has been based on the assumption that the violation from yield trends are caused by the weather impacts), though, it does not accomodate the concrete weather characteristics. The analysis was applied on unbalanced panel data consisting of the information on the individual production of 803 producers specialized on cereal production, which have each the observations from at least two years out of total 8 -years time serie. Specialization on crop production was defined as minimum 50 % share of cereal production on the total plant production. Final panel consists of 2332 observations in total. The values of AVTit, SUMPit a KITit has been associated with each individual producer according to his local jurisdiction for a particular region. Weather impacts in the three specified forms were implemented into models that were defined as stochastic production frontier models that capture the possible heterogeneity effects. The aim is to identify the impact of weather on shift and shape of production frontier. Through the defined models, the production technology and technical efficiency were estimated. We assume that the proposed inclusion in weather impacts will lead to a better explanatory power of defined models, as a result of weather extraction from a random components of the model, or from a set of unmeasured factors causing heterogeneity of the sample, respectivelly. Two types of models were applied to estimate TE - Fixed management model (FMM) and Random parameter model (RPM). Models were defined as translogarithmic multiple-output distance function. The analyzed endogene variable is cereal production (expressed in <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR).</b> Other two outputs, other plant production and animal production (both expressed in <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR)</b> are expressed as the share on cereal production and they appear on the right side of the equation together with the exogene variables representing production factors labour (in AWU), total utilized land (in acres), capital (sum of contract work, especially machinery work, and depreciation, expressed in <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR),</b> specific material (represented by the costs of seeds, plants, fertilisers and crop protection, expressed in <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR),</b> and other material (in <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR).</b> The values of all three outputs, capital, and material inputs were deflated by the the country price indexes taken from the EUROSTAT database (2005 = 100). In Random parameter model, heterogeneity is captured in random parameters and in the determinants of distribution of the technical inefficiency, uit. All production factors were defined as a random parameters and weather in form of KITit enters the mean of uit and so it represents the possible source of unmeasured heterogeneity of a sample. In fixed management model, heterogeneity is defined as a special factor representing firm specific effects, mi. This factor represents unmeasured sources of heterogeneity of sample and enters the model in interaction with other production factors and the with the trend variable, tit. Trend variable represents the impact of technological change at a time t for each producer i. The weather impacts in form of variables AVTit a SUMPit is, together with production factors, excluded from the set of firm specific effects and it is also numerically expressed. That way weather becomes a measured source of heterogeneity of a sample. Both types of models were estimated also without the weather impacts specification in order to obtain the benchmark against which the effects of weather impacts specification on production frontier and technical efficiency is evaluated. Easier interpretation of results was achieved by naming all five estimated models as follows: FMM is a name of fixed management model that does not include specified weather variables, AVT is a name for fixed management model including weather impacts in form of average temperatures AVTit, SUMP is name of|$|R
