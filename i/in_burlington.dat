In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family <b>in</b> <b>Burlington,</b> Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups of women on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional strokes and Fraser returned to the home <b>in</b> <b>Burlington</b> where she remained until three weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{the road}} {{was one of three}} that tied for the #1 ranking on the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of the top ten most {{dangerous}} roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The route, along with U.S. Route 130 (Burlington Pike) <b>in</b> <b>Burlington</b> County and U.S. Route 1 in Middlesex County, were so ranked due to the nine pedestrian deaths that occurred on each of those roads from 2009 to 2011.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) <b>in</b> <b>Burlington,</b> and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic cameras were added {{to create a new}} traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built {{at the same time to}} relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.|$|E
5|$|Damage in New Jersey was minor.

In Camden, a vacant house partially collapsed, and government buildings were evacuated, with city workers given the option of returning home for the day. Due to damage done by the quake, the municipal government of Woodbury reported that the historic Colonel George Gill Green Opera House, which was built during 1880, would be razed, but instead it was renovated to provide housing for senior citizens.

5|$|Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge along the New Jersey coastline {{of up to}} 6.5feet (2m) in Cape May. Higher amounts occurred along the Delaware River, peaking in the state at 10.6feet (3.2m) <b>in</b> <b>Burlington.</b> At its closest approach, Isabel passed within about 215miles (350km) of the state, {{and as a result}} the outer rainbands produced light rainfall. Wildwood along the southeast coast reported 1.3inches (33mm) of rain, while Lincoln Park in the northern portion of the state recorded 2.07inches (52mm) of precipitation. The large wind field of the hurricane produced moderate winds across the state. A shoal in the Delaware Bay experienced sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h) with gusts to 71mph (114km/h). Cape May reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 61mph (98km/h), while Newark in the northern portion of the state experienced gusts to 44mph (71km/h).|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 1789, Allen {{traveled}} to South Hero, Vermont {{with one of}} his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there, and set out the next morning for home. While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route, and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery <b>in</b> <b>Burlington.</b> The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclement weather}} caused many {{educational}} institutions, such as universities and secondary schools, to close. Among these were University of Michigan–Dearborn in Dearborn, Michigan, Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, Ohio, Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois, Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois, Champlain College and the University of Vermont <b>in</b> <b>Burlington,</b> Vermont, Mount St. Mary's University in Emmitsburg, Maryland, Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut, Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, The University of Akron, Kent State University, Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio, Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, The University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio, the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, The Pennsylvania State University, Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont, George Mason University, Northern Virginia Community College and James Madison University in Virginia, Sherbrooke University and Bishop's University, in Quebec, the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland, UMBC in Catonsville, Maryland, Georgetown University in Washington, DC, Cornell University, University of Pittsburgh, Chatham College in Pittsburgh, and West Chester University of Pennsylvania.

5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads <b>in</b> <b>Burlington</b> County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E
