40|$|Existing {{studies in}} finance have {{documented}} the comovement of stock returns of <b>companies</b> <b>headquartered</b> {{in the same}} location. The interpretation is that local investors have a “local bias” due to an information advantage on local companies. This paper argues that localized agglomeration economies affect the fundamentals of local companies, resulting in the local comovement of stock returns. Using the data for China A-share listed companies from 1997 - 2007, we confirm the local comovement of stock returns of <b>companies</b> <b>headquartered</b> in the same city; moreover, the stock returns of a <b>company</b> <b>headquartered</b> {{in a city with}} stronger agglomeration economies are also correlated more highly with stock returns of other <b>companies</b> <b>headquartered</b> in the same city. The local comovement of earnings among <b>companies</b> <b>headquartered</b> in the same city is also found, and the local comovement of stock returns is correlated with the local comovement of earnings. We conclude that correlated local fundamentals due to localized agglomeration economies can explain the local comovement of stock returns. ...|$|R

40|$|Headquarter {{companies}} are generally interposed between the ultimate holding {{company and the}} operating subsidiaries {{of a group of}} companies. The functions of a <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> are mainly to manage investments and to centralize the income of the group prior to remittance to the ultimate holding company. Therefore, generally, the rationale for setting up a <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> is based on economic and structural needs of the group in which the <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> is to be set up. However, it is also common cause that the decision to set up a <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> is, more often than not, influenced by the need to take advantage of tax instruments available in the particular jurisdiction. This allows the group to reduce its overall tax liability and therefore increase its after tax earnings. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|A <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> is {{a company}} within a group of {{companies}} which supervises and co-ordinates the administrative activities of the group. Headquarter companies are formed for various tax- and non-tax-related reasons depending on the particular needs of the group in which the <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> is formed. In the setting up a headquarter-company consideration is given to various key determinants such as political and investment climate, corporate laws and treasury considerations. Tax reasons include deferring tax on income and capital gains, maximizing credit for foreign taxes and reducing withholding taxes. However, when the decision is taken to interpose a <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> between the investor country and the operating subsidiaries' country, the real economic purposes and benefits are usually non-tax in nature. These include the ability to raise external finance, circumventing the application of exchange controls, protection of assets as well as group reorganization and structural consolidation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} South African <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> provisions and their suitability as a gateway for investment into Africa, {{when compared with}} the UK, Netherlands and Botswana. When considering how the South African <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> provisions have developed since their re-introduction in 2011, it is evident that the regime is beneficial; specifically through the absence of the controlled foreign company (‘CFC’) rules, transfer pricing concessions, and the conclusion of double tax agreements (‘DTAs’). When compared with a similar taxing jurisdiction such as the UK, South Africa appears equally competitive. The UK has also identified its tax regime as an ideal holding or headquarter location for business activities into {{the rest of the world}} (including Africa). The UK has affirmed its commitment as a holding company jurisdiction through the reduction of its corporate income tax rate, the overhaul of its CFC provisions, and the absence of exchange control and dividends withholding tax. As a result of the UK’s historical presence in Africa, it too has an extensive DTA network in Africa. Upon closer inspection, it appears that concessions available to a UK resident company are similar to a South African <b>headquarter</b> <b>company.</b> When compared with other African jurisdictions, the Botswana IFSC regime appears less competitive than the South African regime. Similarly, the ‘traditional’ use of a Netherlands holding company appears to be better suited as a holding company regime for business activity in Europe. Accordingly, the South African <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> provisions provide efficient, practical and commercial concessions for multinationals as a gateway into Africa.

40|$|Brand {{management}} is inevitable for sustainable marketing. Civil aviation companies focus on sustainable marketing, {{because of their}} long-term investments. Customer loyalty {{is one of the}} most improtant factors of sustainable marketing. It is known that, if there is no certain limit or border, segmentation damages the reputation of the brands and it {{is one of the most}} important threats of sustainable marketing. Segmentation can be done by using new brands, but this process has its own constraints. Such constraints are related with the reputability of the company. To evaluate the impact of a new brand on reputability, service quality is taken as a metric and SERVQUAL is used. The customers of two civil aviation companies participated the study. These two aviation companies have the same headquarter, but they have different brand management strategies. One of them is globally reputable and it is the <b>headquarter</b> <b>company.</b> 166 questionnaires of the 83 participants are evaluated. It is seen that the service quality perception on the brand of the <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> did not change and the new brand did not effect its reputability. New brand created its own market or took a share from the other civil aviation companies which attract the customers of the <b>headquarter</b> <b>company</b> with their lower prices...|$|E
