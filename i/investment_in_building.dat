Although widely blamed for causing national disunity and losing the country later to the Ming Empire, Hồ Quý Ly's reign actually introduced a lot of progressive, ambitious reforms, including the addition of mathematics to the national examinations, the open critique of Confucian philosophy, the use of paper currency in place of coins, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>building</b> large warships and cannons, and land reform.

50|$|Pennsylvania and Maryland had {{viewed the}} success of the Erie Canal in {{connecting}} rural New York and the Midwest to the ports on the Atlantic Ocean. The <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>building</b> a new canal was costly but well compensated in trade opportunities further down the road. Both Pennsylvania and Maryland began borrowing from European groups to fund the construction of similar transportation infrastructure. By 1841, Maryland had amassed a total debt of a little over $12 million with more than $11 million used for transportation purposes. Pennsylvania had a lower proportion of transportation to other uses debt ratio compared to Maryland but had a total debt that was nearly three times that of Maryland’s. Transportation investment debt reached over $30 million in Pennsylvania by 1841.|$|E
50|$|The {{essence of}} the model is {{a shift in the}} pattern of {{industrial}} investment towards building up a domestic consumption goods sector. Thus the strategy suggests in order to reach a high standard in consumption, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>building</b> a capacity in the production of capital goods is firstly needed. A high enough capacity in the capital goods sector in the long-run expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods. The distinction between the two different types of goods was a clearer formulation of Marx’s ideas in Das Kapital, and also helped people to better understand the extent of the trade off between the levels of immediate and future consumption. These ideas were however first introduced in 1928 by Feldman, an economist working for the GOSPLAN planning commission; presenting theoretical arguments of a two-department scheme of growth. There is no evidence that Mahalanobis knew of Feldman’s approach, being kept behind the borders of the USSR.|$|E

5000|$|The Narn Regime is the {{government}} of the Narn. The regime is led by the [...] "Kha'Ri"; it is basically a large council with different levels (called [...] "circles") of authority. The first circle consists of the national elite who form planetary policy and handle relations with other alien races. Before the Narn-Centauri War (see below), the Kha'Ri's membership consisted mostly of the veterans and leaders of the Narn's successful guerrilla war against the Centauri, which may account for the Kha'Ri's near-obsession with constantly humiliating and defeating the Centauri. The Narn Regime is a young empire, having grown rapidly since their independence from the Centauri Republic in the early 23rd Century. Clever diplomacy, a pragmatic approach to arms dealing, and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>building</b> up their own military were all characteristics of the Narn Regime in the decades leading up to the Shadow War. For instance, the Narn were the only major power willing to sell effective weapons to the Earth Alliance during the Earth-Minbari War, albeit secretly considering the threat of the Minbari turning on them for aiding their enemy. The fact that their weaponry was derived from Centauri designs also raised Narn hopes that the older race might suspect their former occupiers and attack them instead of Narn.|$|E
50|$|John Akers became IBM's CEO in 1985. During the 1980s, IBM's {{significant}} <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>building</b> a {{world class}} research organization produced four Nobel Prize winners in physics, achieved breakthroughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications, and {{made great strides}} in expanding computing capabilities. In 1980, IBM Research legend John Cocke introduced Reduced Instruction Set Technology (RISC). Cocke received both the National Medal of Technology and the National Medal of Science for his innovation, but IBM itself failed to {{recognize the importance of}} RISC, and lost the lead in RISC technology to Sun. In 1984 the company partnered with Sears to develop a pioneering online home banking and shopping service for home PCs that launched in 1988 as Prodigy. Despite a strong reputation and anticipating many of the features, functions, and technology that characterize the online experience of today, the venture was plagued by extremely conservative management decisions, and was eventually sold in the mid-1990s. The IBM token-ring local area network, introduced in 1985, permitted personal computer users to exchange information and share printers and files within a building or complex. In 1988, IBM partnered with the University of Michigan and MCI Communications to create the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), an important step {{in the creation of the}} Internet. But within five years the company backed away from this early lead in Internet protocols and router technologies in order to support its existing SNA cash cow, thereby missing a boom market of the 1990s. Still, IBM investments and advances in microprocessors, disk drives, network technologies, software applications, and online commerce in the 1980s set the stage for the emergence of the connected world in the 1990s.|$|E
