50|$|The {{proportion}} of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with {{the age of}} the whale: 38-51% in calves, 58-87% in adult females, and 71-94% in adult males. Spermaceti wax is extracted from sperm oil by crystallisation at 6 C, when treated by pressure and a chemical solution of caustic alkali. Spermaceti forms brilliant white crystals that are hard but oily to the touch, and are devoid of taste or smell, making it very useful as an ingredient in cosmetics, leatherworking, and lubricants. The substance was also used in making candles of a standard photometric value, in the <b>dressing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and as a pharmaceutical excipient, especially in cerates and ointments. Candlepower, a photometric unit defined in the United Kingdom Act of Parliament Metropolitan Gas Act 1860 and adopted at the International Electrotechnical Conference of 1883, was based on the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle.|$|E

50|$|The 1920s {{were marked}} by a post-war aesthetic. After World War I, the fashion world {{experienced}} a great switch: from tight corsets and hobble skirts—to shapeless, oversized, and sparsely decorated garments. Women began to wear more comfortable fashions, including blousy skirts and trousers. Further, this era gave birth to sportswear fashion. Sportswear, previously recognized as America’s main contribution to fashion, consisted of a casual more relaxed style. Coco Chanel, known as the first modern dressmaker, made {{one of the greatest}} contributions to style in the 1920s: the two-piece dress. She created two-piece <b>dresses</b> out <b>of</b> jersey (<b>fabric),</b> a comfortable stretchy fabric.
