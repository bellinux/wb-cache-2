The CF for {{food of animal origin}} such as milk, eggs, meat and fish depend on a number of influencing factors such as animal species, type of production, feeding of animals, animal performance, system boundaries and outputs of production.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to analyze crucial factors in the output from the production of proteins in food of animal origin, such as milk, meat and eggs. We then consider inputs such as land, water, fuel, minerals and feed, as well as characterize emissions. Finally, we estimate footprints for land (land footprint, LF), water (water footprint, WF) and greenhouse gas emissions (i. e., carbon footprint, CF) during the production process. The wide range of different land and water inputs per unit feed between various studies largely influences the results. Further influencing factors are species and categories of animals that produce <b>edible</b> <b>protein,</b> their yields and the feeding of animals. Coproducts with no or low humanly edible fractions and grassland as feed contribute to a lower need for arable land and lower LF, WF and CF. The most efficient land use or the lowest LF per kilogram of <b>edible</b> <b>protein</b> was estimated for higher milk and egg yields; the highest LF values were calculated for beef, followed by pork. The lowest WF and CF were calculated for <b>edible</b> <b>protein</b> of chicken meat and eggs. <b>Edible</b> <b>protein</b> from ruminants is mostly characterized by a higher CF {{because of the high}} greenhouse gas potential of methane produced in the rumen. A key prerequisite for further progress in this field is the harmonization of data collection and calculation methods. Alternatives to partial or complete replacement of protein of terrestrial animals, such as marine animals, insects, cell cultures, single-cell proteins or simulated animal products from plants, as well as changing eating patterns and reducing food losses are mentioned as further potential ways for more efficient feed production.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{examination of the}} possibility that the fragments of a protein may provide better colloidal stability than the intact protein itself in the case of αs 1 -casein. It more generally considers the surface adsorption behaviour of fragmented proteins. In colloidal systems the polymers are mostly present as polydisperse entities. Polydispersity can either be naturally present or be the result of fragmentation, as happens for food proteins during enzymatic modification. Majority of proteins do not possess the most optimum primary structure expected of an ideal colloidal stabiliser. More desirable surface functionality maybe achieved by hydrolysis of <b>edible</b> <b>proteins.</b> For the theoretical examination of this argument we had to extend and develop a new Self Consistent Field (SCF) approach which also had to be validated first. Although this new approach is an extension of the traditional SCF approach, it is capable of modelling highly polydisperse systems in a manner not currently possible with the more usual technique. In this preliminary work we present the results of our method for both homopolymers and proteins. In the homopolymer case, we investigate how the preferential adsorption of homopolymer fragments is influenced by various parameters such as solution concentration, degree of hydrolysis (DH), the intact size of the original homopolymer and the strength of affinity of monomers to the surface. The colloidal stabilising and surface adsorption properties of fragmented proteins were investigated taking the bovine milk protein αs 1 -casein as an example. The protein was fragmented by selective single bond and also non-selective multiple bond hydrolysis, assumed to be induced by the action of enzyme trypsin. The investigation was carried out at different levels of hydrolysis (DH) and various pH values. We find that the non-selective peptide bond hydrolysis in the case of αs 1 -casein did not provide a better colloidal stability compared to the intact αs 1 -casein, at none of the pH values studied here. However, it was shown that a better colloidal stability can be achieved by the selective peptide bond cleavage of particular bonds...|$|R

In the future, there will be increasingly strong competition for arable land and non-renewable resources such as fossil carbon-sources, water, and some minerals, as well as between food, feed, fuel, fiber, flowers, and fun (6 F’s). Proteins of animal origin like milk, meat, fish, eggs and, probably, insects are very valuable sources of essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins, but their production consumes some non-renewable resources including arable land and causes considerable emissions.
