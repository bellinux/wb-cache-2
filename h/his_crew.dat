5000|$|By mid 1941 the Group {{was engaged}} in {{daylight}} raids on coastal shipping and heavily defended objectives in Occupied Europe. At that stage of the war the Group’s Blenheims were near obsolete and sustaining heavy operational casualties. Nevertheless, operations continued unabated under Air Vice-Marshal D F Stevenson, {{a man who was}} infamous throughout the RAF at the time for his ruthless aggressiveness, his ambition and his lack of concern for the high loss rates suffered by <b>his</b> <b>crews.</b> Even Churchill was greatly disturbed by the loss rates on the attacks Stevenson was ordering <b>his</b> <b>crews</b> to fly. Upon his removal as AOC in December 1941 <b>his</b> <b>crews</b> were greatly relieved (all Max Hasting [...] "Bomber Command" [...] pages 84 and 85).No. 2 Group carried out a low-level attack on Bremen on 2 July 1941 in which the leader, Wing Commander Hughie Edwards of No. 105 Squadron, won the Victoria Cross.|$|R

Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and <b>his</b> <b>crew,</b> unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for <b>his</b> <b>crew.</b> Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and <b>his</b> <b>crew,</b> sets off to explore the stars.|$|E

5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} {{to walk on the}} Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether for the opportunity to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by <b>his</b> <b>crew.</b> In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E

5|$|Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi {{was soon}} arrested, and {{informed}} on his shipmates. Hernández Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hernández Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by {{setting fire to}} a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofresí and <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofresí and <b>his</b> <b>crew</b> boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing.|$|E
