5|$|The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories {{interconnect}} as they complete missions. Some {{missions are}} completed {{with only one}} character and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will {{by means of a}} directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills. There are multiple options for completing heists; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.|$|E

25|$|The United States Army re-evaluated its {{chemical}} and biological weapons programs in 1961. This re-evaluation led to a renewed focus on an <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> program. A project was established to begin producing BZ munitions; one result was the mass production of the Chemical Corps' M43 BZ cluster bomb in March 1962. Though M43s and another BZ weapon, the M44 generator cluster, were produced, they were never really considered {{an integral part of the}} U.S. chemical arsenal. In the end around 1,500 BZ munitions were produced between the M43 and the M44.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B was produced as an <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for chemical weapons {{to be used}} in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, vesicants (blister <b>agents),</b> choking <b>agents,</b> <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agents,</b> riot control agents, blood agents, and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. <b>Incapacitating</b> <b>agents</b> include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. Riot control agents include Mace and pepper spray. Blood agents include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia...|$|R
50|$|Demoralization {{methods are}} {{military}} tactics such as hit-and-run attacks such as snipers, disturbing the enemy with less-lethal weapons and <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agents,</b> and intimidation such as display of force concentration.

2500|$|Chloroform {{has been}} {{reputed to be}} used by criminals to knock out, daze or even murder their victims. Joseph Harris was charged in 1894 with using {{chloroform}} to rob people. Serial killer Dr. H. H. Holmes used chloroform overdoses to kill his female victims. In 1901, chloroform was also implicated in the murder of the American businessman William Marsh Rice, the namesake of the institution now known as Rice University. Chloroform was also deemed to be a factor in the alleged murder of a woman in 1991 when she was asphyxiated while sleeping. In a 2007 plea bargain a man confessed to using stun guns and chloroform to sexually assault minors. Use of chloroform as an <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> has become widely recognized, bordering on clichéd, due to the popularity of crime fiction authors having criminals use chloroform-soaked rags to render victims unconscious. However, it is nearly impossible to incapacitate someone using chloroform in this manner. It takes at least five minutes of inhaling an item soaked in chloroform to render a person unconscious. Most criminal cases involving chloroform also involve another drug being co-administered, such as alcohol or diazepam, or the victim being found to have been complicit in its administration. After a person has lost consciousness due to chloroform inhalation, a continuous volume must be administered and the chin must be supported {{in order to keep the}} tongue from obstructing the airway, a difficult procedure typically requiring the skills of an anesthesiologist. In 1865 as a direct result of the criminal reputation chloroform had gained, medical journal The Lancet offered a [...] "permanent scientific reputation" [...] to anyone who could demonstrate [...] "instantaneous insensibility" [...] using chloroform.|$|E
5000|$|There is one {{documented}} case of incapacitating agents {{being used}} in recent years. In 2002, Chechen terrorists took {{a large number of}} hostages in the Moscow theatre siege, and threatened to blow up the entire theatre if any attempt was made to break the siege. An <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> was used to disable the terrorists whilst the theatre was stormed by special forces. However, the <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent,</b> unknown at that time, caused many of the hostages to die. The terrorists were rendered unconscious, but roughly 15% of the 800 people exposed were killed by the gas. The situation was not helped {{by the fact that the}} authorities kept the nature of the <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> secret from doctors trying to treat its victims. At the time, the gas was reported to be an unknown <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> called [...] "Kolokol-1". The Russian Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko later stated that the <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agent</b> used was a fentanyl derivative.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, MKSEARCH was {{the name}} given to the {{continuation}} of the MKULTRA program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN/CHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971. [...] The project was a joint project between The U.S. Army Chemical Corps and the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents with a focus on <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agents.</b> [...] The purpose of the project was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques for producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II, the United States {{military}} investigated a {{wide range}} of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral, chemical <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agents</b> to include psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative DMHP, certain tranquilizers, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, was assigned the NATO code [...] "BZ" [...] and was weaponized beginning in the 1960s for possible battlefield use. (Although BZ figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 movie, Jacob's Ladder, as the compound responsible for hallucinations and violent deaths in a fictitious American battalion in Vietnam, this agent never saw operational use.) Destruction of American stockpiles of BZ began in 1988 and is now complete.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of strong incapacitating effects and a favourable safety margin led the Edgewood Arsenal team {{to conclude that}} DMHP and its derivatives, especially the O-acetyl ester {{of the most active}} isomer, EA-2233-2, were among the more promising non-lethal <b>incapacitating</b> <b>agents</b> to come out of their research program. However they were disadvantaged by producing severe hypotension at incapacitating doses, and were not as effective as the more widely publicised anticholinergic agents such as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate which had also already been weaponised. Funding for continued development was ultimately not approved, and the cannabinoid research program was indefinitely suspended {{along with the rest of}} the Edgewood Arsenal experiments in the late 1970s, in accordance with the US commitment to cease research into chemical weapons under disarmament treaties.|$|R
