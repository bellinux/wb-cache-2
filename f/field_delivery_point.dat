This is usually {{referred to as}} the DPBC, or <b>Delivery</b> <b>Point</b> Bar Code. By including <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> information, it enables the Postal Service to sort mail into <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> (address) sequence.|$|R
50|$|The 6-digit {{postal code}} {{is made up}} of the sector code and the <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> The sector is {{represented}} by the first two numbers of the postal code. The remaining four numbers define the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> within the sector. e.g.24 is the sector code; 7964 is the <b>delivery</b> <b>point,</b> i.e. house or building.|$|R
50|$|Since that time, {{the amount}} of new mail <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> have {{steadily}} increased {{from year to year}} to its present estimate of 1.4 million new <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> a year.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} <b>Delivery</b> <b>Point</b> is often added after the ZIP+4 {{and before the}} check digit, {{in which case the}} {{computation}} of the check digit includes the ZIP+4 and the <b>Delivery</b> <b>Point.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{each city}} block or {{section of a}} rural route has a {{different}} +4 extension, and address numbers generally increase by 100 per block, the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> is typically the last two digits of the address. In {{the early days of}} DPBC, it was acceptable to determine the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> in this fashion, but since suite and other secondary designations are assigned unique <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> which cannot be determined without the CASS/DPV database, this is no longer possible. The <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> is usually redundant for post office boxes, since they are typically assigned their own ZIP + 4 code, but must nonetheless be assigned a complete DPBC for full postal discounts. The full rules for identifying the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> for a given address are specified in the USPS CASS Technical Guide.|$|R

40|$|Mapping of {{postal address}} to a mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} task that affects the efficiency of postal service. This task is very complex in the countries such as India, where postal addresses are not structured. Further most of the times the destination addresses in such countries are incomplete, approximate and erroneous which adds to the complexity of mapping postal address to <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> Automation of this aspect of the postal service is a challenge. This paper presents a soft computing model to map the postal address to mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> Firstly machine readable postal address is processed to identify the address components using a novel fuzzy symbolic similarity analysis, and further these labeled components are organized as a symbolic postal address object. This postal address object is further processed using the newly devised fuzzy symbolic methodology for mapping the address to mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> Symbolic knowledge bases for postal address component labeling and mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> mapping are devised. Fuzzy symbolic similarity measures are formulated once for address component labeling and the second time for mapping the entire address to a mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> In sequel to similarity computations, which are viewed as fuzzy membership values, an expert system comprising of alpha-cut de-fuzzification is proposed to evaluate the confidence factors, while inferencing the validity of address component labels and mail <b>delivery</b> <b>points.</b> The system is tested exhaustively and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained in address component identification and about 86 % in mail <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> mapping, while working on an Indian postal data base of about 500 addresses.

50|$|In the US Postal System, a <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> is a {{specific}} set of digits between 00 and 99 assigned to every address. When combined with the ZIP + 4 code, the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> provides a unique identifier for every deliverable address served by the USPS.|$|R
50|$|The two-digit <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> {{number is}} {{combined}} with an additional check digit in the DPBC. This digit is used by barcode sorters (BCS) to check if the ZIP, ZIP + 4, or <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> ZIP codes contain an error. In a database, storing the ZIP + 4 code in a 10 character field (with the hyphen) allows easy output in the address block, and storing the check digit in a 3-digit field (instead of calculating it) allows automatic checking {{of the validity of}} the ZIP+4 and <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> <b>fields</b> in case one had been changed independently. In order to receive the appropriate barcode discount, the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> digits and the +4 extension must be verified using an up-to-date, CASS or DPV certified program.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} method for empirically {{measuring}} the difference in carbon footprint between traditional and online retailing (“e-tailing”) from entry point to a geographical area to consumer residence. The method only requires data on the locations of brick-and-mortar stores, online <b>delivery</b> <b>points,</b> and residences of the region’s population, and on the goods transportation networks in the studied region. Such data are readily available in most countries, so the method is not country or region specific. The method has been evaluated {{using data from the}} Dalecarlia region in Sweden, and is shown to be robust to all assumptions made. In our empirical example, the results indicate that the average distance from consumer residence to a brick-and-mortar retailer is 48. 54 km in the studied region, while the average distance to an online <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> is 6. 7 km. The results also indicate that e-tailing increases the average distance traveled from the regional entry <b>point</b> to the <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> from 47. 15 km for a brick-and-mortar store to 122. 75 km for the online <b>delivery</b> <b>points.</b> However, as professional carriers transport the products in bulk to stores or online <b>delivery</b> <b>points,</b> which is more efficient than consumers’ transporting the products to their residences, the results indicate that consumers switching from traditional to e-tailing on average reduce their CO 2 footprints by 84 % when buying standard consumer electronics products. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Pickup and Delivery Problem with Shuttle routes (PDPS) is {{a special}} case of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) where the trips between the pickup <b>points</b> and the <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> can be {{decomposed}} into two legs. The rst leg visits only pickup points and ends at some <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> The second leg is a direct trip { called a shuttle { between two <b>delivery</b> <b>points.</b> This optimization problem has practical applications in the transportation of people between a large set of pickup points and a restricted set of <b>delivery</b> <b>points.</b> This paper proposes three mathematical models for the PDPS and a branch-and-cutand- price algorithm to solve it. The pricing sub-problem, an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC), is solved with a labeling algorithm enhanced with e cient dominance rules. Three families of valid inequalities are used to strengthen the quality of linear relaxations. The method is evaluated on generated and real-world instances containing up to 193 transportation requests. Instances with up to 87 customers are solved to optimality within a computation time of one hour...|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} self-pick-up {{involves}} the customer {{in the delivery}} process. Instead of delivering parcels to the customer, the parcels are delivered to <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> (DP), from where the customer collects their order. DPs are spreading rapidly across Europe and have {{been the focus of}} recent research. Early contributions focused on the accessibility of <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> networks [15 – 17]. Durand and Gonzalez-Feliu [18] compared self-pick-up to traditional home deliveries and found that an `all delivery point’ scenario would be the most beneficial in terms of total kilometres driven with vans and trucks. Accordingly, several studies agree that <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> have the potential to reduce the travel time of freight vehicles {{as well as that of}} customers [4, 10, 19].|$|R

We introduce the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Shuttle routes (PDP-S) which is a special case of the PDPT relying on a structured network with two categories of routes. Pickup routes visit a set of pickup points independently of their <b>delivery</b> <b>points</b> and end at one <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> Shuttle routes are direct trips between two <b>delivery</b> <b>points.</b> We propose a path based formulation of the PDP-S and solve it with a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm.
