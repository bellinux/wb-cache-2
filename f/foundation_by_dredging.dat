25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} <b>dredged</b> <b>by</b> Boral Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material <b>by</b> <b>dredges</b> has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> created a woefully sludgy clayey sediment load in the river which did not clear.|$|R

50|$|Both Port Eynon and Horton beaches have {{suffered}} from denudation of their sand cover, possibly caused <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> activities in the Bristol Channel.|$|R
5000|$|Seine, locally named la barre, had a {{significant}} bore until the 1960s. Since then, it has been practically eliminated <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and river training.|$|R
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been given to the behavioural and physiological effects of dredging on clams. The response of the clam Spisula solida under stress imposed <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> activity is analysed in terms of reburial time and two acute indices: AEC (adenylic energetic charge) and ATP per milligram dry weight. Stress on undersized (< 25 mm) S. solida, due to habitat disturbance <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> itself and subsequent aerial exposure was measured with in situ studies during September 1999 at Vilamoura, a bivalve sandy ground, off the southern coast of Portugal. The study showed significant increases in reburial time and a decrease in adenylic-derived indices of stressed bivalves compared with in situ control bivalves monitored by SCUBA divers. It was concluded that the stress caused <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> affects the behavioural and physiological responses of S. solida. Moreover, the reburial time is an easy and valuable indicator of stress levels in the studied clam...|$|R
50|$|Sediment {{deposition}} {{was halted}} in the 1960s when the Leslie Street Spit was extended beyond {{the southern edge}} of the islands. Left to nature, the islands would diminish over time, but this is limited due to hard shore lines built to limit erosion. Over the years land reclamation has contributed to an increase {{in the size of the}} islands. The harbour was shallow with a sandy bottom and the sands were moved <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> or suction methods. Ward's Island was expanded <b>by</b> <b>dredging.</b> Today's Algonquin Island, formerly known as Sunfish Island, was created from harbour bottom sands.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{consequences}} of substrate mining are hidden, they are tremendous. Aggregate particles that are too fine to be used are rejected <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> boats, releasing vast dust plumes and changing water turbidity...|$|R
50|$|Port Kembla is a {{man-made}} cargo port or artificial harbour, with an outer harbour protected by breakwaters and an inner harbour constructed <b>by</b> <b>dredging,</b> {{located in the}} Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.|$|R
50|$|Cedar Bayou {{was first}} closed in 1979 to protect Mesquite Bay from an {{oil spill in}} the Gulf. Hurricane Allen {{partially}} reopened the pass in 1980, and it was fully opened <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The Belah is {{designated}} {{as having a}} moderate ecological status by the environment agency. The flow of the river has been sped up <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and widening and the river is prone to siltation and bank erosion.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} aging {{artificial}} lakes, Canonsburg Lake {{has a problem}} with silting raising the bed of the lake. This process has already made some parts of the lake unnavigable, and if left untreated <b>by</b> <b>dredging,</b> it may ultimately make the lake unusable <b>by</b> boaters. A <b>dredging</b> program would cost approximately $3 million, but no funding exists to implement one.|$|R
50|$|The Rhine carries {{very large}} amounts of debris into the lake. In the mouth region, it is {{therefore}} necessary to permanently remove gravel <b>by</b> <b>dredging.</b> The large sediment loads are {{partly due to the}} extensive land improvements upstream.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{length of the}} canal was 5.3 miles (8.5km) with a 1,600 foot (500m) right-of way. The longer current length of 5.5 miles (8.9km) {{is due to the}} extension of the lakeshore <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> in the late 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Much sand is {{extracted}} <b>by</b> <b>dredges</b> {{from the bottom}} of rivers such as the Red River in Yunnan, or quarried in dry river beds. Due to the large demand for sand for construction, illicit sand mining is not uncommon.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the port was finally encouraged during the Meiji Period with {{the influence of a}} project that was meant to improve the estuary of the Sumida River <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> channels and reclaiming land at Tsukishima and Shibaura.|$|R
50|$|Walsh Island was a {{small island}} at the {{junction}} of {{the north and south}} arms of the Hunter River of New South Wales, Australia. The island was reclaimed <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and is now the eastern end of Kooragang Island.|$|R
5|$|A marina {{was started}} in 1979 <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> the upper harbour and laying pontoons. Light {{industry}} and car parks occupy the adjacent land. More pontoons were completed in 1991 and 1995. The Whitby Marina Facilities Centre was opened in June 2010.|$|R
50|$|Bishop Island {{was formed}} <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> {{at the mouth}} of the Brisbane River between 1909 and 1912. It was named Bishop Island in 1912 after Allan Fitzroy Gordon Bishop, the captain of the dredge Hercules {{involved}} in creating the island.|$|R
50|$|When {{purchased}} in 1907, {{the lake was}} very shallow, only 5 ft deep in the deepest spot. Much of it was actually marshland or slough—a drainage area for the neighborhood. It was deepened <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> to produce the current lake.|$|R
50|$|Complaints {{have arisen}} because NIOT {{recovered}} artefacts <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> {{the sea floor}} of the site. This method might allow errant artefacts to be collected along with those that actually correlate with the site. Analysing stratification is virtually impossible with this method as well.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 a 500-metre seawall was {{constructed}} {{to improve the}} defences against severe wet weather events. The $8 million cost {{of the project was}} paid by the United Nations Development Programme and was carried out <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and civil contracting company Hall Pacific.|$|R

5000|$|The Port of Olympia is a {{deepwater}} {{port for}} oceangoing vessels. It is sustained <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> in Budd Inlet and Capitol Lake, an impoundment of the Deschutes River. Without dredging, the Deschutes would recreate its historical estuary with annual [...] of sediment deposit.|$|R
25|$|It is also mined {{from some}} {{alkaline}} lakes such as Lake Magadi in Kenya <b>by</b> <b>dredging.</b> Hot saline springs continuously replenish {{salt in the}} lake so that, provided the rate of dredging is no greater than the replenishment rate, the source is fully sustainable.|$|R
50|$|Alamitos Bay is {{protected}} by both the natural sand spit Peninsula and the Long Beach Breakwater.It is divided from the San Gabriel River and Seal Beach {{by a pair of}} jetties. The natural geography has been heavily altered <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and landfill subsequent to development.|$|R
40|$|Fecal {{coliform}} concentrations {{increased significantly}} (F test) {{in the immediate}} vicinity of a maintenance dredging operation in the Mississippi River navigation channel. Increased counts were attributed to the disturbance and relocation of bottom sediments <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and a concomitant release of sediment-bound fecal coliforms...|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1922 by the Army Corps of Engineers <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> sand, {{the land}} was {{initially}} owned by developer Carl Fisher, who purchased several land parcels of {{what would become the}} city of Miami Beach. It is accessible by land and barrier islands via the MacArthur Causeway.|$|R
50|$|The River Rib {{used to have}} {{frequent}} floods due {{to heavy}} rain in the autumn, but this propensity was resolved <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and engineering work in the 1970s. It {{was used as the}} main water supply in Buntingford and the surrounding areas before a pump was installed.|$|R
5000|$|South Island (aka 'Lovers Island')is a half-acre {{island in}} Bunnell's Pond created <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> in the 19th century, {{connected}} to the mainland by the stone Henry Setzer Memorial Bridge. A corresponding [...] "North Island" [...] became a peninsula with additional dredging in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Newport Harbor is a semi-{{artificial}} harbor {{that was}} formed <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> Newport Bay estuary {{during the early}} 1900s. Several artificial islands were built, which are now covered with private homes: Newport Island, Balboa Island, Little Balboa Island, Collins Island, Bay Island, Harbor Island, Lido Isle and Linda Isle.|$|R
50|$|The {{river was}} altered by the 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens, a nearby volcano, and subsequent flows of ash and other debris. It was further altered <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> to remove sediment, and by {{construction of the}} Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure on the North Fork Toutle River.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife Biologist Nachicket Kelkar {{claimed that}} the noise and {{disturbance}} caused <b>by</b> intensive <b>dredging</b> activities {{is known to have}} deleterious impacts on aquatic biodiversity, especially the National Aquatic Animal of India, the Ganges River Dolphin which is basically founded in Bhagalpur region of Bihar. In particular, substrate-breeding fish species are negatively affected <b>by</b> <b>dredging</b> and might even become locally extinct following failed breeding. As a bulk of fisheries depends on benthic (bottom-dwelling) fishes in most of India’s larger rivers, this will mean important threat to the sustainable production of fish in these systems as well.|$|R
