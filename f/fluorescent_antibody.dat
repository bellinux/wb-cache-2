5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Methods used in {{laboratory}} diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), direct <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test). The bacteria can be recovered from the person only {{during the first three}} weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.|$|E
25|$|For {{identification}} of serotypes, culture is often used. Culture is difficult. Requiring a special medium, cycloheximide-treated McCoy or HeLa cells, and yields are still only 30-50%. DFA, or direct <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> test, PCR of likely infected areas and pus, are also sometimes used. DFA {{test for the}} L-type serovar of C trachomatis is the most sensitive and specific test, but is not readily available.|$|E

When these <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibodies</b> were applied {{to a group of}} 16 additional isolates, 8 were identifiable by cross-reaction to 3 of the 11 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Some nitrite-oxidizing enrichment cultures from different habitats contained cross-reacting strains of Nitrobacter spp...|$|R

25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease. Lung infection with L. jordanis is sometimes misdiagnosed as a Aspergillus mold infection. This mold also causes a fatal type of pneumonia which L. jordanis is able to mimic. Using human sera, indirect <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> tests strongly indicated that unrecognized human infections with L. jordanis may be occurring. A study of patients from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, NY revealed a possible risk of nosocomial infections from shower heads found to contain L. jordanis. After this finding, monthly shower head disinfection procedures were instituted, but about 19% of shower heads remained positive for Legionella. Infections of individuals who are not immunocompromised are also possible.|$|E

40|$|Explant {{culture of}} the adult {{goldfish}} retina results in vigorous neuritic growth, provided that the optic nerve has been previously crushed in vivo. The site of new membrane addition in these growing neurites was studied with a membrane-binding lectin Concanavalin A (Con A) {{in conjunction with a}} <b>fluorescent</b> indirect <b>antibody</b> method. Explant cultures were labeled with Con A, followed by rabbit antibodies to Con A. This treatment was shown to immobilize Con A receptors while permitting growth. Twenty-four hours later, the washed preparation was treated with <b>fluorescent</b> goat antirabbit <b>antibodies.</b> The bound <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibodies</b> appeared as a pattern of contiguous fluorescent speckles confined to the area of old growth while regions near the distal end of the neurite were not fluorescent.
