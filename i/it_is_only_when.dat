5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that special relativity is applicable only to inertial frames, {{and that it is}} unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames.

25|$|According to this theory, {{during the}} summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the {{southwest}} monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in proto-oncogenes can {{modify their}} {{expression}} and function, {{increasing the amount}} or activity of the product protein. When this happens, they become oncogenes, and, thus, cells have a higher chance to divide excessively and uncontrollably. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the body. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.|$|E

25|$|Freud, like Josef Breuer, {{found the}} {{hypothesis}} that hysterical manifestations were generated by ideas {{to be not only}} warranted, but given in observation. Disagreement between them arose when they attempted to give causal explanations of their data: Breuer favored a hypothesis of hypnoid states, while Freud postulated the mechanism of defense. Richard Wollheim comments that given the close correspondence between hysteria and the results of hypnosis, Breuer's hypothesis appears more plausible, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> repression is taken into account that Freud's hypothesis becomes preferable.|$|E

I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own.

25|$|Mutations in proto-oncogenes, {{which are}} the {{normally}} quiescent counterparts of oncogenes, can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein. When this happens, the proto-oncogenes become oncogenes, and this transition upsets the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, making uncontrolled growth possible. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, even if this were possible, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the organism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the cathedral {{has been plagued by}} more {{theories}} than any other, a singular problem for those attempting to discover the truth. For example, Louis Grodecki argued that the lateral doors of the transept portals were cut through the walls at a later date, and van der Meulen that they had wanted to rebuild the western portals (then only 50 years old). None of these theories refer back to the actual stonework, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> one has done so, as John James did exhaustively in 1969, that one realizes that the construction process was in fact simple and logical.|$|E
25|$|In lesbian feminist Marilyn Frye's (1978) essay Notes on Separatism and Power she posits female {{separatism}} as {{a strategy}} practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or Women's Studies programmes). She argues that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> women practice it, self-consciously as separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). Male separatism {{on the other hand}} (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labor unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon.|$|E

In confirming an order, he may make such variations as he thinks fit. In exercising his discretion the President may, but is not bound to, consult the Council of Presidential Advisers. All orders made under sections 8 and 9 cease to have effect unless they are confirmed by the President within 30 days from the date the PCRH's recommendations are received by the President.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} also notable {{differences}} between the Sedition Act and the MRHA. The first relates to the consequences of violation. Under section 4 of the Sedition Act, an offender is criminally liable. In contrast, under the MRHA, {{the imposition of a}} restraining order does not per se carry criminal liability. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> this restraining order has been breached that criminal liability will attach to the offender. This difference reflects the varying approach towards disruption of public order – the punitive approach of the Sedition Act contrasts with the pre-emptive approach of the MRHA. Such an arrangement allows the Government to mount a calibrated response against perpetrators. If the Sedition Act was the only relevant statute in operation, it might result in disproportionately harsh action being taken against minor public order disturbances.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{people with}} dysthymia will seek out {{treatment}} not necessarily because of depressed mood, but rather due to increasing {{levels of stress}} or because of personal difficulties that may be situation-related. This is hypothesized to be because of the chronic nature of the disorder, and how depressed mood is often {{thought to be a}} characterological pattern for the individual with the condition. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the person experiences increasing stress that he or she thinks to go to some sort of trained professional for symptom relief. It is usually through the administration of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV that dysthymia is first diagnosed. At this point, {{with the help of a}} trained professional, a certain line of treatment is often discussed and then selected. It is important to consider all factors in the person's life that may be affected when deciding on a particular course of treatment. Additionally, if one method of treatment does not particularly work for a certain individual, it may be helpful to try something else.|$|E
