5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid <b>deafening</b> themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E

5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid <b>deafening</b> themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Many late-implanted prelingually <b>deafened</b> {{cochlear}} implant (CI) patients struggle to obtain open-set speech understanding. Since {{it is known}} that low-frequency temporal-envelope information contains important cues for speech understanding, the goal {{of this study was to}} compare the temporal-envelope processing abilities of late-implanted prelingually, and postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users. Furthermore, the possible relation between temporal processing abilities and speech recognition performances was investigated. Design: Amplitude modulation detection thresholds (AMDTs) were obtained in 8 prelingually and 18 postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users, by means of a sinusoidally modulated broadband noise carrier, presented through a loudspeaker to the CI user’s clinical device. Thresholds were determined with a 2 -down- 1 -up 3 -interval oddity adaptive procedure, at 7 modulation frequencies. Phoneme recognition (Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant) scores (% correct at 65 dB SPL) were gathered for all CI users. For the prelingually <b>deafened</b> group, scores on 2 additional speech tests were obtained: (1) a closed-set monosyllable-trochee-spondee (MTS) test (% correct scores at 65 dB SPL on word recognition and categorization of the suprasegmental word patterns), and (2) a speech tracking test (number of correctly repeated words per minute) with texts specifically designed for this population. Results: The prelingually <b>deafened</b> CI users had a significantly lower sensitivity to amplitude modulations than the postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users, and the attenuation rate of their TMTF was greater. None of the prelingually <b>deafened</b> CI users were able to detect modulations at 150 and 200 Hz. High and significant correlations were found between the results on the amplitude modulation detection test and CNC phoneme scores, for the entire group of CI users. In the prelingually <b>deafened</b> group CNC phoneme scores, word scores on the MTS test, and speech tracking scores correlated significantly with the mean AMDT of the modulation frequencies between 5 and 100 Hz and with almost all separate amplitude modulation thresholds. High correlations with these speech measures were also found for the attenuation rate of and the surface area below the TMTF. In postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users, CNC phoneme scores only correlated significantly with the 100 - and 150 -Hz amplitude modulation thresholds, as well as with the attenuation rate of and surface area below the TMTF. Conclusions: Prelingually <b>deafened</b> CI users were less sensitive to temporal modulations than postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users, and the attenuation rate of their TMTF was steeper. For all CI users, subjects with better amplitude modulation detection skills tended to score better on measures of speech understanding. Significant correlations with low modulation frequencies were found only for the prelingually <b>deafened</b> CI users and not for the postlingually <b>deafened</b> CI users. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) This {{study examined}} the social and personal stresses experienced by profoundly <b>deafened</b> adults who lost their hearing {{after the age of}} twelve. The data were gathered from several sources including the late <b>deafened</b> author's own experience, a discussion group, two growth groups, one case study and a questionnaire profiling 28 late <b>deafened</b> subjects' experiences and attitudes. Very little empirical research has been done on the topic of late deafness. It was found in this study that late <b>deafened</b> people experience a highly stressful upheaval when they 1 ose their hearing. Careers, personal relationships and emotional security absorb the major blows inflicted by deafness. In spite of the trauma, the individuals studied in this project (who were an average age of 40, deaf for 13 years) conveyed a hopeful message to newly <b>deafened</b> people: ???It's bad, it gets worse, but things will get better??? The subjects of this study overwhelmingly embraced total communication methods (sign language, speech and lipreading), socialize fairly well, indicated surprisingly good self-esteem, and were strongly self motivating and assertive. This study concluded with some recommendations to support personnel servicing <b>deafened</b> adults. The need to respect the unique situation imposed by adult deafness was stressed as well as the apparent need for more concentrated and appropriate dissemination of information to recently <b>deafened</b> people. Suggestions for continuing the education of late-deafened adults applaud the concept of mainstreaming which allows late <b>deafened</b> people to remain in the hearing world they grew up with, functioning more equally with the help of support services provided by interpreters, note takers or tutors. Recommendations were also made for initiating a helping relationship, providing strong role models, dealing with confused negative self concept and leading groups of late <b>deafened</b> individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} diminished {{auditory}} feedback on monophthong and diphthong production was examined in postlingually <b>deafened</b> Australian-English speaking adults. The participants were 4 female and 3 male speakers with severe to profound hearing loss, who {{were compared to}} 11 age- and accent-matched normally hearing speakers. The test materials were 5 repetitions of hVd words containing 18 vowels. Acoustic measures that were studied included F 1, F 2, discrete cosine transform coefficients (DCTs), and vowel duration information. The durational analyses revealed increased total vowel durations with a maintenance of the tense/lax vowel distinctions in the <b>deafened</b> speakers. The <b>deafened</b> speakers preserved a differentiated vowel space, although there were some gender-specific differences seen. For example, there was a retraction of F 2 in the front vowels for the female speakers that did not occur in the males. However, all <b>deafened</b> speakers showed a close correspondence between the monophthong and diphthong formant movements that did occur. Gaussian classification highlighted vowel confusions resulting from changes in the <b>deafened</b> vowel space. The results {{support the view that}} postlingually <b>deafened</b> speakers maintain reasonably good speech intelligibility, in part by employing production strategies designed to bolster auditory feedback. 14 page(s...|$|R

Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra - whose song is generating the barrier - by <b>deafening</b> himself to her song, allowing him to take control of Deep Ones. With the barrier down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{new insights}} into the world of late <b>deafened</b> adults, a previously underrepresented, minoritized group that has experienced not only a loss of hearing, but in many cases, also a loss of self and cultural identity. Life experience narratives were collected from seven late <b>deafened</b> adults who participated in in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews. Video-recordings of the interviews were transcribed in order to identify the major themes, or recurring patterns of meaning (ideas, thought, feelings) within each transcript, as well as patterns of meanings across narratives. Transcripts were analyzed using interpretive/hermeneutic phenomenology, based on the philosophies of Husserl and Heidegger. Fifteen emergent themes were abstracted and clustered together under four broader, super-ordinate themes or dimensions of the lived experience of late <b>deafened</b> adults. The dimensions included: transformation of self, social interaction, interaction with technology, and deaf advocacy. Although each late <b>deafened</b> adult’s lived experience of becoming <b>deafened</b> was unique because of their personal history, context and background, there were similarities in the descriptions of the experience. Themes from the narratives of participants were strengthened when they were confirmed in subsequent interviews, with differences within their experiences adding depth and breadth to the dimensions of the experience. The constituted meanings were then interpreted against the backdrops of wider socio-political and historical contexts that have shaped American Deaf Culture. The findings of this study provide a heuristic tool to restructure the understanding of late <b>deafened</b> adults, shifting from a strictly medicalized paradigm to a comprehensive model based on understanding the social world of late <b>deafened</b> adults...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} cochlear implantation (CI) on prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults who have been trained by auditory-verbal/oral communication since childhood. METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative data was investigated regarding the rehabilitation, hearing level, and educational experience of eight prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults. All eight patients were diagnosed with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (preoperative hearing levels were over 100 dB). All used hearing aids (HA) {{before the age of}} two and were trained by auditory-verbal/oral communication since childhood. The average age of the patients {{at the time of their}} CI operations was 23. 3 ranging from 18 to 29 years of age. The average postoperative observation time was 55. 4 months ranging from 11 to 90 months. RESULTS: Improvement was achieved not only on the pure-tone hearing threshold, but also in speech perception on tests using the Japanese video speech discrimination score (SDS) system. All of them now use CI very well in their daily lives and play important roles in society. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that even prelingually <b>deafened</b> adult patients could achieve considerable improvement through CI when they were trained well by auditory-verbal/oral communications since childhood. The indications of CI for prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults must be determined carefully, but all of them do not have to be rejected only because they are prelingually <b>deafened.</b> In other words, CI could be recommended for prelingually <b>deafened</b> adult patients if they received habilitation well with consistent auditory-verbal/oral training using well-fitted HAs...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: With {{expanding}} {{inclusion criteria}} for cochlear implantation, {{the number of}} prelingually <b>deafened</b> persons who are implanted as adults increases. Compared with postlingually <b>deafened</b> adults, this group shows limited improvement in speech recognition. In this study, the changes in health-related {{quality of life in}} late-implanted prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults are evaluated and related to speech recognition. METHODS: Quality of life was measured before implantation and 1 year after implantation in a group of 28 prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults, who had residual hearing and who used primarily oral communication. Patients completed 3 questionnaires (Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire, Glasgow Benefit Inventory, and Health Utility Index 3). Postoperative scores were compared with preoperative scores. Additionally, phoneme recognition scores were obtained preimplantation and 1 year postimplantation. RESULTS: Quality of life improved after implantation: scores on the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire improved significantly in all subdomains (basic speech perception, advanced speech perception, speech production, self-esteem, activity, and social interaction), the total Glasgow Benefit Inventory score improved significantly, and the Health Utility Index 3 showed a significant improvement in the utility score and in the subdomains "hearing" and "emotion. " Additionally, a significant improvement in speech recognition scores was found. No significant correlations were found between gain in quality of life and speech perception scores. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that quality of life and speech recognition in prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults significantly improved as a result of cochlear implantation. Lack of correlation between quality of life and speech recognition suggests that in evaluating performance after implantation in prelingually <b>deafened</b> adults, measures of both speech recognition and quality of life should be used...|$|R
25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while <b>deafening</b> adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E

25|$|Several studies over {{recent decades}} {{have looked at}} the neural {{mechanisms}} underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by <b>deafening</b> birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird's song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable). After Nordeen & Nordeen made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that auditory feedback was necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo & Konishi (1999) designed an auditory feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of auditory feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed auditory feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of auditory feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.|$|E

25|$|Long {{before the}} Tarnopol Ghetto was set up, {{and only two}} days after the arrival of the Wehrmacht, up to 2,000 Jews were killed in the provincial capital of Tarnopol, one-third of them by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Some of the victims have been decapitated. The SS shot the {{remaining}} two-thirds, in the same week. In Stanisławów – another provincial capital in the Kresy macroregion – the single largest massacre of Polish Jews prior to Aktion Reinhardt was perpetrated hand in glove by Orpo, SiPo and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police (brought in from Lwów) on 12 October 1941; tables with sandwiches and bottles of vodka had been set up about the cemetery for shooters who needed to rest from the <b>deafening</b> noise of gunfire; 12,000 Jews were murdered before nightfall. A total of 31 deadly pogroms were carried out throughout the region in conjunction with the Belarusian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian Schuma. Further east, during the massacre in Jedwabne, over 300 Jews died (Institute of National Remembrance's Final Findings), burned alive in a barn set on fire by a group of Polish men in the presence of German Ordnungspolizei. The circumstances surrounding the events in Jedwabne are still debated, and include the ominous presence of the Einsatzgruppe Zichenau-Schroettersburg under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper deployed in Bezirk Bialystok, as well as German Nazi pressure, anti-Semitism, but also resentment over Jewish cooperation with the Soviet invaders during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 as well as the alleged Jewish participation in anti-Polish terror following Soviet 1939 invasion of Kresy in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact.|$|E
