40|$|The {{design of}} a water based thermal store {{for use in a}} {{domestic}} central heating system has been investigated theoretically, experimentally and numerically. The transient operation of the store during both the space heating and domestic hot-water modes of operation have been investigated separately. Heat transfer correlations in terms of Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers have been developed in order to predict the natural convection heat transfer coefficient for the outside surface of the horizontal axis finned tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> located within the store. These heat-transfer correlations can predict the value of the heat transfer coefficient with an accuracy of better than 5 % and are in good agreement with existing heat transfer correlations developed for the same geometry of finned tubes and modes of heat transfer. The effect of the water flow rate in the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> on the internal heat transfer coefficient is also investigated. This flow rate should be above 4 litre/minute to achieve a high rate of heat-transfer from the wall of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> to the water in the pipe. A detailed investigation of the use of horizontal and vertical baffles to increase the effectiveness of heat delivery in the domestic hot water mode has been carried out. Some improvements can be achieved by the use of a horizontal flat plate located {{in the middle of the}} store. This plate, when correctly sized enhances stratification and hence improves the effectiveness of heat recovery. Vertical plate arrangements and a rectangular duct situated around the upper <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> were found to be ineffective. However, due to an increased velocity of the water around the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> the external <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was increased by 12 %. The comparison of experimental observations with computer simulations of the development of the thermocline in the store during the space heating mode of operation showed the presence of a jet in the bottom region of the store at the return inlet. The jet induces a significant amount of mixing in the store which reduces the effectiveness of heat recovery. Correlations in terms of Richardson number and effectiveness of heat delivery have been developed to characterize the effect of this jet. An inlet arrangement designed to achieve a Richardson number exceeding 3 significantly reduces the mixing created by the jet and can increase the amount of heat delivered in the space heating mode by approximately 5 %...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based on an industry-sponsor project {{involving}} a novel waste heat-to-electricity conversion system. This proprietary system utilizes thermal energy from a low temperature heat sources to produce torque that drives an electric generator to produce electricity. The system needs to be studied through scientific research to help with optimizing the product development, component design, and overall system performance. The main objectives of this study are to develop simulation tools (numerical model) that will allow to simulate the thermo-fluid processes in various system components and to use this numerical model to study the heat transfer and phase-change processes along with the work interactions. In {{the first part of this}} study, a novel numerical model was developed using the commercial CFD software Fluent. The novelty of this model was its capability to simultaneously simulate the phase-change and moving boundary processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such integrated model has been developed. The model coupled the Mixture model and the Dynamic Mesh model via developed user-defined functions. However, due to the limitations of the CFD software, the investigations were restricted to the fundamental heat transfer and phase-change processes in the lower vessel and the associated <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> which undergoes the boiling process, along with the piston movement in the vessel. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> is one of the key components of the system where the primary phase change process takes place and its design has a direct impact on the overall system performance. Thus, the main focus on the second part of this study was on a detailed investigation of the phase-change process in the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> and its design improvement as well as the type of the working fluid. The investigation of the working fluid involved four volatile substances: methanol, ethanol, pentane and butane. Due to the low boiling point and low latent heat pentane was recommended as the best substance among the four. Its low boiling point also allows the system to extract heat at lower waste heat temperatures. The study of the heat exchange and phase-change processes in the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and the vessel involved a detailed investigation of these processes, which include the spatio-temporal variations of the flow patterns and the mixture quality. Various <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometries and configurations were considered. A common feature observed in all these configurations was the presence of a cyclic process inside the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tube where the low quality mixture (heavy fluid) near the bottom of the vessel enters from one end of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and the high quality mixture (light fluid) escapes in the form of jet into the vessel from the other end of the tube. It was found that the speed of the jet increased with an increase in the surface area of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil.</b> The impact of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry and configuration on the flow patterns and the mixture quality as well as the piston movement is presented and discussed in detail.

40|$|AbstractGas coolers are heat {{rejection}} heat exchangers in vapour compression refrigeration systems that use carbon dioxide (CO 2) as refrigerant. The design of gas coolers {{has a significant}} influence {{on the performance of}} CO 2 refrigeration systems as it determines to a large extent the gas cooler/condenser pressure and the power consumption of the system. This paper investigates local refrigerant and air heat transfer coefficients in plain fin-and-tube gas cooler coils using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling. The aims were to provide insights into the variation of the local heat transfer rates in the coil and determine the influence of a) design enhancements {{such as the use of}} slit fins and b) to develop correlations for overall refrigerant and air heat transfer coefficients to be used in CO 2 refrigeration component and system modelling. The results from the model which was validated against experimental measurements showed that a horizontal slit on the fin between the first and second row of tubes can lead to an increase in the {{heat rejection}} rate of the gas cooler by between 6 % and 8 %.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the role of filtration in maintaining clean <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coils</b> and overall performance. Combinations of 6 different levels of filtration (MERV 14, 11, 8, 6, 4, and no filter) and 4 different coils (an eight-row lanced-fin coil, HX 8 L), (an eight-row wavy-fin coil, HX 8 W), (a four-row lanced-fin coil, HX 4 L) and (a two-row lanced-fin coil, HX 2 L) were tested at 4 different air velocities (1. 52, 2. 03, 2. 54, 3. 05 m/s (300, 400, 500, 600 ft/min)). The fouled conditions were obtained after injection of 600 grams of ASHRAE standard dust upstream of the filter/coil combination. This magnitude of dust is representative of a year of normal operation for an air conditioning system. The air-side pressure drops of the coils and filters and air-side heat transfer coefficients of the coils were determined from the measurements under the clean and fouled conditions. Depending upon the filter and coil test, the coil pressure drops increased in the range of 6 %- 30 % for an air velocity at 2. 54 m/s (500 ft/min). The impact was significantly greater for tests performed without a filter. The largest relative effect of fouling on pressure drop occurs for coils with fewer rows and having lanced fins. Coils with a greater number of rows can hold more dust so that a fixed amount of dust has a relatively smaller impact. The impact of fouling on air-side heat transfer coefficients was found to be relatively small. In some cases, heat transfer was actually enhanced due to additional turbulence caused by the presence of dust. The experimental results for pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients were correlated and the correlations were implemented within computer models of prototypical rooftop air conditioners and used to evaluate the impact of fouling on cooling capacity and EER. The equipment cooling capacity is reduced with fouling primarily because of a decrease in air flow due to the increase pressure drop rather than due to changes in h eat transfer coefficient. In most cases, the EER was reduced with fouling primarily due to increased fan power. However, the changes in EER were relatively small, in the range of 1 %- 9 % (10 %). For most cases, equipment having low efficiency filters had higher EER after fouling than equipment with high efficiency filters, because the high efficiency filter caused significantly higher pressure drops than the low efficiency filters. The extra filter pressure drop outweighed the reduced coil pressure drop after fouling. The impact of fan efficiency curves was also investigated in the study. The energy penalty associated with high efficiency filters was reduced considerably with higher efficiency fans. There is an energy penalty associated with the use of high efficiency filtration. However, the primary reason for selecting high efficiency filters for a particular application would be improved air quality. For HX 8 L, the quantity of dust passing through the coil with a MERV 4 filter was approximately 30 times the dust passing the coil with a MERV 14 filter. Without an upstream filter, the quantity of dust passing through the coil was approximately 60 times the value for a MERV 14 filter...|$|E

Free-convective buoyancy movements of the water around the outside of this coiled pipe (immersed in the store) occur {{as a result of}} initially-cold water (at ~ 20 Â° C) being forced internally through the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger's</b> pipe.

Increasing the rate of water being passed through the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger's</b> pipe resulted in a reduction of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger's</b> quality effectiveness, but a rise in the thermal store's recuperation effectiveness. The latter was due to the reduced level of mixing between the ascending warm streams and the descending colder streams.

50|$|Air-source {{heat pumps}} are more popular in milder winter climates where the {{temperature}} is frequently {{in the range of}} 40-55 °F (4-13 °C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil,</b> which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.

The presence of plants in closed habitats results in increased water flux through the system.

A water cooled heat transfer coil was traversed into the flame to determine how close to the swirler exit the heat transfer could occur, without a major increase in the combustion inefficiency. This was shown to be 70 mm from the radial swirler throat outlet. Rapid fuel and air mixing was achieved using fuel injection through {{the wall of the}} 76 mm swirler outlet throat, assisted by a 41 mm diameter outlet orifice at the exit of the 76 mm internal diameter wall fuel injector. This created swirling flow with higher axial velocities and a more concentrated high turbulence region downstream of the orifice outlet. A 4 mb burner pressure loss was used, which is typical of domestic forced draught combustion systems. The air inlet temperature was 400 K, which is typical of reverse air flow cooled combustion chambers at domestic water heater conditions. The strong swirling flow interaction with the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>coil</b> give an 89 % thermal efficiency with the front of the coil 70 mm from the swirler outlet. The emissions measurements showed that the combustion inefficiency was below 0. 1 %, the CO/CO 2 ratio < 0. 001 and the NOx emissions were 5 ppm at 0 % oxygen with the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> at 70 mm from the radial swirler outlet. This design easily met the 2018 EU legislation for eco-design of domestic water heaters...|$|R
