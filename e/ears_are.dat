5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> also usually dark.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{very well}} preserved. The {{external}} <b>ear</b> (pinnae) <b>is</b> fairly large and broad in a mouse-like fashion. The inner <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> also exceptionally {{preserved in the}} form of the Meckels cartilage, which may be of extreme relevance in understanding the evolution of the mammalian ear.|$|R

5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|More than 10% of the hamsters kept in {{the first}} winter develop the summer coat. In the second winter, only a few change into the winter coat and winter colour is less pronounced. The {{moulting}} in the winter fur starts in October or November and is completed in December, while the summer coat begins in January or February and is completed in March or early April. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> grey with a pinkish tint.|$|E
50|$|Surfer's <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{the common}} name for an {{exostosis}} or abnormal bone growth within the ear canal. Surfer's <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{not the same}} as swimmer's ear, although infection can result as a side effect.|$|R

25|$|Cropping of the <b>ears</b> <b>is</b> {{done for}} several reasons, {{including}} the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long <b>ears</b> can <b>be</b> vulnerable {{in a physical}} confrontation with a predator. It is also believed that cropping improves the dog's hearing because sound can travel into ear easier. It should be noted the cropping of <b>ears</b> <b>is</b> illegal in the UK.|$|R
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> sometimes small, rotated, malformed, {{or absent}} entirely {{in people with}} TCS. Symmetric, bilateral narrowing or absence of the external <b>ear</b> canals <b>is</b> also described. In most cases, {{the bones of the}} middle ear and the middle <b>ear</b> cavity <b>are</b> misshapen. Inner <b>ear</b> malformations <b>are</b> rarely described. As a result of these abnormalities, a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss.|$|R
30|$|Pathology of the {{external}} and middle <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> the third most common reason of visiting a general practitioner or a family doctor [1, 2].

5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5000|$|When first {{registered}} as a breed, {{there were four}} distinctly described types of ears cataloged as acceptable for Lamancha breed registry. These were two specific 'gopher' types; short and long, and two 'elf' types; regular Lamancha ears and Cookie ears. Short gopher <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> closest to the head, could have one fold (but no length), and gave a smooth appearance to the head. After 1960, these were the only ear-type that a registered buck could have. Long gopher <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> small and round-tipped, between one-half inch and one inch long, and accordion-folded, such that when pulled out flat and released, they would fold right back. The elf types were a little longer, but still very small compared to other breeds. [...] Cookie ears, named by Mrs. Frey after the first goat born with such <b>ears,</b> <b>were</b> pointy-tipped and turned up and back toward the head; hugging closely to the head. Regular Lamancha <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> flat, stood out from the head, bent downward, and could be an inch or up to two inches long. Only Lamanchas with Swiss-type (long) <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> unregisterable.|$|R

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. <b>Ears</b> <b>are</b> small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
50|$|Ear {{cleaning}} {{in general}} {{may also be}} ineffective when used by one with little experience or guidance. When done incorrectly, significant amounts of <b>ear</b> wax may <b>be</b> pushed deeper into the ear canal rather than removed. The lining of the <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> delicate and can be easily damaged. The <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> also self-cleaning and earwax is needed to protect the ear from dirt, dust, and bacterial infections.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
