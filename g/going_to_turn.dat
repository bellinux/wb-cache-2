Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando, all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would prove to be the case.|$|E

Venables left acrimoniously in January 1999, as the south-London club went into administration. His appointment had created a media frenzy, with Goldberg boasting that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> Palace into a European force within the next five years. But the dream was over within a year, and Palace narrowly avoided going out of business, although they did at least finish in a secure position in Division One. Venables did lead Crystal Palace into Europe, via the InterToto Cup, but chose to field youth and ultimately the adventure ended immediately as Palace faced an uncertain future after his dealings in the transfer market.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the FBI {{believed}} that Coppola was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> state's evidence against the Genovese family and {{cooperate with the}} FBI. The FBI {{was willing to give}} him immunity from prosecution and enter him in the Witness Protection Program if he cooperated. The FBI believed he was involved in the killing of Lawrence Ricci (along with his son and stepson) on orders of Tino Fiumara, one of the men the FBI was hoping to prosecute with Coppola's cooperation. Coppola waived a speedy arraignment and spent the next two nights sleeping at FBI headquarters in lower Manhattan at an undisclosed hotel. He also met with a government arranged lawyer known as a shadow counsel. On the third day, however, Coppola refused to cooperate. His defense lawyer Henry Mazurek said that Coppola only dragged out the process out of concern for his wife, who he feared would also be arrested and charged.|$|E

The following year, Butthole Surfers shocked many fans and critics by signing with the major label Capitol Records. In 2017, Paul Leary reflected: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} The Beatles and Grand Funk Railroad and Dean Martin, and the thought of being on the same record label that they were on was too fucking weird, really weird.

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12–24hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern Cook Islands to order evacuations.|$|E

This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it.|$|E
500|$|A leading theory among audiences {{was that}} Chloe would {{eventually}} change {{her name to}} Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books. The creative team removed the notion that Chloe was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more [...] "different shades of the same color [...] Chloe is a softer version of Lois". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.|$|E

I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.'

[...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{out to be just}} a [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!"

500|$|Prior to the film's opening five-day {{weekend in}} the United States and Canada, {{predictions}} for its weekend performance ranged from as low as $70million to as high as $125million. According to CinemaScore, Hancock was given a B+ grade by audiences. The film was shown in advance screenings on July1, 2008 in 3,680 theaters in the United States and Canada, grossing $6.8million. The film was widely released on July2, 2008, expanding to 3,965 theaters. At {{the conclusion of the}} five-day weekend, Hancock took top placement at the box office in the United States and Canada, grossing an estimated $103.8million. The film had the third-biggest opening 4th of July weekend after Transformers and Spider-Man2. Hancock was Will Smith's fifth film to open on a 4 July weekend and was his most successful opening to date. The film was also Smith's eighth film in a row to take top placement in the American and Canadian box office and the twelfth film in Smith's career to lead the box office. Hancock was also Peter Berg's strongest opening of his directing career to date.

500|$|Curtis chose Notting Hill as {{he lived}} there {{and knew the}} area, saying [...] "Notting Hill is a melting pot and {{the perfect place to}} set a film". This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea of}} building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> or who I'm going to be turning on!"

500|$|Burton's {{portrayal}} of Dylan has been generally well received. The character's romance with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), however, garnered a negative response from viewers and critics alike. Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that their storyline was [...] "everyone’s favorite storyline for curing insomnia". Despite negative reviews, Burton's portrayal during the storyline was praised, specifically by journalist Connie Passalacqua Hayman, who wrote: [...] "But it was Steve Burton as Dylan who {{stole the show}} with Dylan’s tearful and very sensitive reaction to the news, as his character loves what he believed to be his baby very much." [...] When {{the truth about the}} paternity of Chelsea's child was revealed, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps remarked (in reference to Burton), [...] "When the truth came out it provided some meaty material for this fan favorite." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity gave a mixed review when Dylan was revealed as Nikki's son, writing: [...] "However, the foreshadowing that Dylan (Steve Burton) is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out to be Nikki’s long-lost son is so heavy-handed that it seems hard to believe that the show is going in any other direction. Dylan is the right age. He looks like he could be related to Nikki. The character is in desperate need of a more ties to the canvas; being Avery’s ex is not enough to keep him in town, much less front-and-center. My big objection to this twist is, what’s the actual story? We have spent months learning every single thing about this character who probably would not exist if Y hadn’t {{jumped at the chance to}} poach Burton from GH." [...] She added: [...] "Dylan would get a mother to replace his father that passed away. Nikki would get a child who can use his carpentry skills to build her a nice bookcase. That’s sweet, but it’s a situation, not a plot. There really aren’t any consequences. Nick would be angry that the guy he’s convinced Avery still loves is his half-brother, but he already has one half-brother he despises. Another one really isn’t a big deal." [...] Burton's portrayal earned him a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2016.|$|E
