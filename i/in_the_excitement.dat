5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II.

He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> females, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> phase {{can last}} from several minutes to several hours. The onset of vasocongestion results <b>in</b> {{swelling}} of <b>the</b> woman's clitoris, labia minora and vagina. The muscle {{that surrounds the}} vaginal opening grows tighter and the uterus elevates and grows <b>in</b> size. <b>The</b> vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating organic liquid. Meanwhile, the breasts increase slightly in size and nipples become hardened and erect.|$|R
25|$|The {{origin of}} this mystification lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> brought to Europe by the legendary tales, {{especially}} those by Leo Africanus: Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent {{cities in the}} Timbuktu region, such as Gao and Walata. In West Africa the city holds an image that {{has been compared to}} Europe's view on Athens. As such, the picture of the city as the epitome of distance and mystery is a European one.|$|E
25|$|The plateau {{stage in}} females is {{basically}} {{a continuation of the}} same changes evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> stage. The clitoris becomes extremely sensitive and withdraws slightly and the Bartholin glands produce further lubrication. The tissues of the outer third of the vagina swell, and the pubococcygeus muscle tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. Masters and Johnson refer to the changes that take place during the plateau stage as the orgasmic platform. For those who never achieve orgasm, this is the peak of sexual excitement.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by Tom and {{his friend}} Mr Yates, the young people decide to put on an amateur {{performance}} of the play Lovers' Vows. Edmund objects, believing Sir Thomas would disapprove and feeling that {{the subject matter of}} the play is inappropriate for his sisters. Edmund reluctantly agrees to take on the role of Anhalt, the lover of the character played by Mary Crawford. The play provides a pretext for Henry and Maria to flirt in public. Fanny observes this, but again Aunt Norris, caught up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of staging a play, does not.|$|E

50|$|DVI was {{announced}} at the second annual Microsoft CD-ROM conference in Seattle to a standing ovation <b>in</b> 1987. <b>The</b> <b>excitement</b> at <b>the</b> time stemmed {{from the fact that}} a CD-ROM drive of the era had a maximum data playback rate of ~1.2 Mbit/s, thought to be insufficient for good quality motion video.

25|$|On May 6, Hancock's II Corps {{attacked}} Hill at 5 a.m., overwhelming the Third Corps {{with the}} divisions of Wadsworth, Birney, and Mott; Getty and Gibbon were in support. Lee had assured Hill that Longstreet's Corps would arrive to reinforce Hill before dawn, but moving cross-country in the dark, they made slow progress and lost their way at times. Ewell's {{men on the}} Turnpike had attacked first, at 4:45a.m., but continued to be pinned down by attacks from Sedgwick's and Warren's corps {{and could not be}} relied upon for assistance. Before a total collapse, however, reinforcements arrived at 6 a.m., Brig. Gen. John Gregg's 800-man Texas Brigade, the vanguard of Longstreet's column. General Lee, caught up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement,</b> began to move forward with the advancing brigade.

25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

Businesses along all the main streets posted large {{hand-drawn}} [...] "Go Sens Go" [...] signs, residents put up large displays in front of their homes or decorated their cars. A large Senators flag was draped on the City Hall, along with a large video screen showing the games. A six-story likeness of Daniel Alfredsson was hung on the Corel building and the Senators organization held rallies at City Hall, and car rallies of decorated cars paraded from Lynx stadium, through downtown to Scotiabank Place.|$|E

50|$|Hoosier Hysteria is <b>the</b> {{state of}} <b>excitement</b> {{surrounding}} basketball in Indiana, or more specifically the Indiana {{high school basketball}} tournament. <b>In</b> part, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> stemmed from <b>the</b> inclusion of all tournament entrants into the same tournament, where a small town's David might knock off a large city's Goliath. The most famous example occurred in 1954, when Milan (enrollment 161) defeated Muncie Central (enrollment over 1,600) to win the State title.

5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> that surrounded <b>the</b> Giants the previous year was gone.

The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained [...] "dangerously instructive information" [...] and could [...] "encourage anti-social (behavior)". The board decided, [...] "The {{film as a}} whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels." [...] The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.|$|E

500|$|At this time, the anarcho-syndicalists {{were still}} {{at the head of}} the labor {{movement}} in Cuba. However, despite the maritime, railway, restaurant and tobacco industries being controlled by organized anarchists, it wasn't until 1925 that a major anarchist federation was successfully organized by workers. Similar to the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo of Spain, non-anarchist members of the Confederación Nacional Obrera Cubana (National Cuban Workers Confederation), eventually formed the Communist Party of Cuba in August 1925. By this time, many anarchists (including Alfredo López and Carlos Baliño) had become swept up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> about the Russian Revolution, and had become party to more authoritarian forms of organizing. Many strikes occurred in the fall of 1925, and the government, once again under the leadership of Machado, was quick to suppress the labor movement. Several labor leaders were shot, and several hundred Spanish anarchists were deported in one month. Machado stated [...] "You are right - I don't know what anarchism is, what socialism is, what communism is. For me they are all the same. All bad patriots." [...] Alfredo López, then secretary-general of the CNOC, was arrested first in October 1925, and encouraged to join the government, followed by a second arrest in July 1926.

After Boss Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting the boss for his shot. Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle to the truck. He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks to a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, Dragline implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim. As the captain's car drives away, it crushes Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. Dragline is now wearing leg irons, and there is a new Walking Boss. As the camera zooms out, the torn photograph of Luke grinning with the two women is superimposed on a bird's eye view of the cross-shaped road junction.|$|E
