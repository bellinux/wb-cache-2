5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression techniques {{is another matter}} altogether. Recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> decompression dives in {{the normal course of}} their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.|$|E

5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{literally}} anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to {{have shown that the}} conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in the aerials, but both crashed and {{failed to make the}} final. Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned but finished last, in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's {{performances}} {{earned him}} selection for the M.C.C. winter {{tour of the}} West Indies in the 1925–26 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> most of the bowling and provide the cricketing quality. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, {{but a series of}} representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed to be close to the full England side.|$|E

5|$|On 5 April, Kane captained Tottenham for {{the first}} time in a 0–0 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. Two weeks later, he scored his 30th goal of the season in a 3–1 win against Newcastle United at St James' Park, making him the first Tottenham player to reach that {{milestone}} since Gary Lineker in 1991–92. Later that month, he was included as one of two forwards in the PFA Team of the Year, alongside Chelsea's Diego Costa. He was also voted the PFA Young Player of the Year. On 24 May 2015, he headed in an Eric Dier cross for the only goal of an away win at Everton on the final day of the season to confirm fifth place for Tottenham, thus qualifying them to the group stage of the following season's UEFA Europa League. It was his 21st goal of the league campaign, equalling a Premier League club record alongside Teddy Sheringham, Jürgen Klinsmann and Gareth Bale. At the end of the season, Kane remarked that he had done more in the single campaign than he had <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in his whole career.|$|E
5|$|With India's older players {{opting out}} of the inaugural World Twenty20, Pathan {{was one of several}} younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between college students from divorced and intact families {{with respect to their}} expectations for marriage, division of household labor, and childcare. A divorced family was defined as one in which the parents have divorced and includes those who remain single after the divorce and those where one or both parents have remarried. An intact family was defined as one in which the parents were currently married to each other and had never been divorced from each other. Participants included 102 Southern Illinois University undergraduate students enrolled in a introductory psychology course who participated for course credit. It was hypothesized that participants from divorced families would have higher expectations for an egalitarian marriage, more negative attitudes toward divorce, higher expectations for the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in performing household labor, and higher expectations for the husband 2 ̆ 7 s role in taking care of the children than those participants from intact families. Results suggest that women have higher expectations for an egalitarian marriage and more positive attitudes toward marriage than men <b>do,</b> women <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more household tasks than men whereas men <b>expect</b> household tasks <b>to</b> be shared equally, and women from intact families <b>expect</b> husbands <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more childcare than what men <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whereas women from divorced families <b>expect</b> husbands <b>to</b> <b>do</b> less than what men <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do...</b>|$|R

25|$|Connecticut was a {{perennial}} powerhouse but {{after having a}} mediocre season, according to Greg Anthony, and finishing 9th in the Big East play. They were not <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much in the tournament. Aside from the poor regular season play, Connecticut was able to walk through their first three games without much struggle {{and was able to}} get wins over teams that were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in the tournament. Behind the phenomenal play of Kemba Walker, who is now a star for the Charlotte Hornets in the NBA, he was able to put up a solid stat line.
