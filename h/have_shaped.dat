5|$|The former stables, in {{red brick}} with a tiled roof, were {{completed}} around 1636 and are contemporary with the Jacobean mansion; they are listed at grade II*. They form a quadrangle {{immediately to the}} west of the hall, enclosing a rectangular courtyard. The main east face of the quadrangle stands at right angles to the front of the house; it has nine bays of two storeys and an attic. Its centrepiece, added by Edward Blore in around 1837, consists of an arched stone entrance flanked by pilasters, above which a clock tower rises from the first-floor level. The tower features twinned arrow-slit windows and clock faces with stone surrounds, and is topped by a bell chamber and ogee cupola with finials. In addition to the centrepiece, the east face has four bays which are set forward and <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> gables topped with finials. The north and south ends of this east building also <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> gables.|$|E

5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} that <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Graham {{subsequently}} held {{a series}} of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units. Volunteering for overseas service, he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) on 26 July 1941. He was subsequently posted to the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment as the adjutant, followed by attendance at the Staff School. Promoted to captain in September 1942, Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division before being attached to the British Army. Serving with the British 7th Armoured Division, he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943–44. Coming ashore {{on the first day of}} the Allied landing at Salerno, he was wounded but remained on duty. During this period he gained valuable operational experience in armoured warfare; while his service in North Africa may also <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> his thinking about the use of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and armoured battles of 1941–42.|$|E
5|$|Several plays <b>have</b> <b>shaped</b> Edward's {{contemporary}} image. Christopher Marlowe's play Edward II {{was first}} performed around 1592, {{and focuses on}} Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites. Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker. The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries James VI of Scotland and Henry III of France, may have influenced William Shakespeare's portrayal of Richard II. In the 17th century, the playwright Ben Jonson picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, Mortimer His Fall.|$|E
