25|$|Thus began, {{under dark}} and adverse circumstances, on 29 October 1840, the {{important}} administration in which Guizot remained the master-spirit for nearly eight years.

25|$|Prior to the 1920 in the USA, the soybean {{was mainly}} a forage crop, {{a source of}} oil, meal (for feed) and {{industrial}} products, with very little used as food.

During the Great Depression, the drought-stricken (Dust Bowl) regions of the United States {{were able to use}} soy to regenerate their soil because of its nitrogen-fixing properties.

25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their <b>great</b> <b>leader</b> Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with delight to teach to move us to good; as if one should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E
25|$|In the {{old days}} I had looked up to MacDonald as a <b>great</b> <b>leader.</b> He had a fine {{presence}} and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark {{him as a man}} of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.|$|E
25|$|In September 1911, Vanagaitis started {{publishing}} journal Birutė which began {{using the term}} Lithuania Minor more often, competing with previous preferred term Prussian Lithuania. This reflected {{a shift in the}} understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green–white–red flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the <b>great</b> <b>leader),</b> it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutė provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians knew more about the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutė was plagued by lack of leadership and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages.|$|E
