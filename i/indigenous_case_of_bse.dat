40|$|In {{the entire}} European Union, hardly any cattle now become ill due to BSE. Thus in Germany the last <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> was {{detected}} in the year 2009.

The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) are of the opinion that all healthy cattle slaughtered aged older than eight years (96 months) should continue to be systematically tested in order to record <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> atypical <b>BSE</b> and to recognise a potential new epidemic as early as possible...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports the}} results of tissue {{infectivity}} assays of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent in orally exposed cattle at stages during the incubation period. Estimations of the titre of infectivity in central nervous system (CNS), certain peripheral nerve ganglia and distal ileum tissue were made according to time post exposure from the relationship between incubation period and dose for RIII mice and C 57 bl mice using data from titrations of brain material from <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE.</b> The rate <b>of</b> increase of infectivity in the bovine CNS was then estimated, taking into account these tissue infectivity titres, the variability of the brain titre <b>of</b> clinical field <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> and the probability density of the expected number of months before clinical onset of each infected bovine. The doubling time for CNS was shown to equal 1. 2 months. The titre in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was, on average, approximately 1 log units less than CNS, and cervical DRG approximately 0. 5 log less than thoracic DRG. The pattern of increase of infectivity in the distal ileum is that of an initial increase up to 14 - 18 months post exposure, followed by a decrease, {{which is likely to}} be highly variable between animals. These results will be informative for future risk assessments <b>of</b> <b>BSE,</b> especially in relation to reviewing current control measures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) epidemic in cattle has had a huge economic impact on the agricultural industries across Europe. Furthermore, scientific evidence now strongly supporting a link between a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and consumption of BSE-infected animals has further heightened the need both to understand the transmission of these new diseases and to improve control measures to protect public health. In this paper we review work undertaken by our group using epidemiological models to understand the transmission dynamics <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> and vCJD. We present new estimates of the future number <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>BSE</b> {{and the number of}} infected animals slaughtered for consumption for Great Britain, and summarise similar analyses undertake...|$|R
