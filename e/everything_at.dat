5|$|The Army {{presence}} at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall {{as head of}} the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change. In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company. The company was paid a fee of $25,000 per month on a cost-plus contract, about 1 percent of the $2.8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities. Roane-Anderson did not take over <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> once, and a phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943; transportation and garbage collection soon followed. It assumed responsibility for water and sewage in November, and electricity in January 1944. The number of Roane-Anderson workers peaked at around 10,500 in February 1945, including concessionaires and subcontractors. Thereafter, numbers declined to 2,905 direct employees and 3,663 concessionaires and subcontractors when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946.|$|E

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E

25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows <b>everything.</b> <b>At</b> the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

500|$|Epic Records had {{proposed}} that the album be recorded in Barbados, but the band had wanted to avoid what Bradfield called [...] "all that decadent rockstar rubbish". It was bassist Nicky Wire's idea, says Bradfield, that the band [...] "should not use <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> its disposal" [...] in recording the album. Instead, recording began with sound engineer Alex Silva at the low-rent, [...] "absolutely tiny" [...] Sound Space Studios in Cardiff. The album was mixed by Mark Freegard, who had previously worked with The Breeders. [...] "She Is Suffering" [...] was produced by Steve Brown. The recording took four weeks.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, {{the singer}} {{acknowledged}} that the term [...] "Renaissance Man" [...] is given to artistic individuals like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, but that the female equivalent has never existed. She claimed the release serves as [...] "an ode" [...] to her friends who are [...] "good at doing <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> once". She speaks of the dedication in lines such as [...] "I can be an engine / Buzzing like a bee / I'm a real independent". Both the lyrics and production were considered reminiscent of Oh Land's previous work, according to Sam Lansky of Idolator.|$|E

Houchen later said that [...] "it {{was the only time}} I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm just going to take the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury. He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager Frank Barlow he found himself hating <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> the club, from the supporters to the Old Showground itself.|$|E
500|$|On Gatlif's direction, Odile Tremblay at Le Monde {{remarked that}} he had taken a heavy burden in {{directing}} a Holocaust movie along with coupling it with the [...] "poetic effervescence" [...] that the Romani are known for. He added that this can be regarded the best among his films. Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif's directorial style as passive and [...] "documentarian", such that it [...] "sometimes verges on emotional distance". [...] "What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated", he added. Eric Hynes at TimeOut lauded Gatlif's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romani out of a melodramatic story. East County Magazines negative review summed that Gatlif had too much faith on his audience, [...] "expecting them to take <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> face value".|$|E

500|$|In 1741, the Austrian {{authorities}} informed Maria Theresa that Bohemian populace {{would prefer}} Charles Albert {{to her as}} sovereign. Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't know if a town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom when she wrote to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made up. We must put <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting on a winter campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E
500|$|In late May 1923, Kuhn {{received}} the Porter Cup as Vanderbilt's best all-around athlete. According to the Atlanta Constitution, [...] "Doc Kuhn, {{in winning the}} Porter Cup, has taken the last leaf in the laurel. Offered each year by the Porter Clothing company, the trophy has risen in distinction from a mere silver emblem to a symbol more highly prized than which there is none to offer to a Vanderbilt athlete". Kuhn was also captain of the basketball team, president of the student council, president of Phi Kappa Psi and Hellenic president. The Atlanta Journal said, [...] "Doc Kuhn is captain and president of <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> Vanderbilt but the co-eds". The only two football games he lost at Vanderbilt were in 1923, to undefeated teams: national champion Michigan and the Texas Longhorns. The Commodores were Southern Conference (SoCon) co-champion in 1923, with two All-Southern ends–Lynn Bomar and Hek Wakefield, and All-Southern halfback Gil Reese.|$|E

Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, {{a political science professor at}} the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> me.

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} and produced entirely in Hokkaido, including the album's cover artwork and music videos. When writing the songs, Yamaguchi thought up imagery for each song, {{and asked the}} other band members to picture this while creating and performing the songs. Yamaguchi created the album's music and melody while thinking about how they would be received by other people, but wrote the lyrics entirely introspectively. [...] "Mikazuki Sunset" [...] and [...] "Shiranami Top Water" [...] were the first songs produced by the band, and were the band's first attempts at making club-style music. Due to their success on college radio, Yamaguchi felt like this was proof that the mix of dance music with Japanese melodies was a good direction, and continued to make music in this style. Yamaguchi {{was inspired by the}} differences in house and techno music styles when writing the album. Yamaguchi was mindful about how to reach a wide audience, and considered that live instruments were important to stress how the album was rock music, as pure dance music was based on electronic and sampled instruments. One convention the band kept for the album was to record <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> 126BPM, {{to make it easier for}} the band's drummer, who had not experienced performing dance music before.|$|E
500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints <b>everything</b> <b>at</b> the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E
