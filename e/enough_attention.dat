One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying <b>enough</b> <b>attention.</b> He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him <b>enough</b> <b>attention.</b> To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E

Another important benefit, the improved observation redundancy {{and then the}} reliability (Li et al. 2013, 2017 b), gained from additional frequency signals does not attract the <b>enough</b> <b>attentions.</b> Here the reliability {{is referred to as}} capability of observation system to resist the observation abnormality and outliers. However, to achieve the realistic reliability measures, one has to first assess the correct stochastic model of triple-frequency signals (Li 2016).|$|R

30|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{characterizations of}} the oscillation source {{have not been}} paid <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> to so far. Different methods use different criteria to characterize their sources. For instance, damping torque based methods characterize the source by the generator with a negative damping torque coefficient, and the energy based methods characterize the source as the generator producing dissipating energy. However, we cannot prove that the generator having positive damping torque coefficient {{will never be the}} oscillation source in any way, so the damping torque based methods may possibly give wrong location results [33]. A similar conclusion holds for other methods.|$|R
40|$|China now {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} places where software outsourcing businesses are flourishing. However, the subcontracting in the current software outsourcing practices has not received <b>enough</b> <b>attentions.</b> This research attempts to further the understanding on this issue. Mixed empirical research approaches were used to explore the extent and the impacts of the outsourcing subcontracting. The findings suggest the subcontracting widely exists in current China outsourcing industry. Its major enabling factors were also identified. While subcontracting provides the industry with specialized services as well as organizational and managerial flexibility in a low cost way, it also introduces some negative influences. Four future trends are also addressed in this paper...|$|R

According to the NPA, prior to South Sudan's declaration of Independence, beginning in 2007, private interests sought or secured 5.15 million hectares of land in the agriculture, biofuels, forestry, carbon credit, and ecotourism sectors—equivalent to more than eight percent of South Sudan’s total land area.|$|E
25|$|The Wirehaired Vizsla {{thrives on}} attention, exercise, and interaction. It is highly intelligent, and enjoys being {{challenged}} and stimulated, both mentally and physically. Vizslas {{that do not}} get <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> and exercise can easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants {{to be close to}} its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing under the covers.|$|E
40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of online reviews, an unwieldy glut of information may be in some cases presented to the consumers. To {{address the problem of}} information overload, the voting mechanism for online review helpfulness has been used by many websites. This study focuses on the effects of emotional valence and arousal in review content on consumer perceptions of online review helpfulness, which has not received <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> before. Using real-world data and econometric model, we found emotions within review content significantly influence review helpfulness. Furthermore, the interaction effect of emotional valence and arousal is investigated in details. This study makes a theoretical contribution to online review helpfulness research and also provides guidance to e-commerce companies in managing online reviews...|$|R
40|$|Face {{recognition}} {{technique is}} widely used in the realworld applications over the past decade. Different from other biometric traits such as fingerprint and iris, face is the biological nature for humans to recognise a person even met just once. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which simulates the mechanism of fixations and saccades in human visual perception, to handle the face recognition from single image per person problem. Our method is robust to the local deformations of the face (i. e.,expression changes and occlusions). Especially for the occlusion related problems, which have not received <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> compared with other challenging variations of illumination, expression and pose, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches despite various types of occlusions. Experimental results on the FRGC and the AR databases confirm the effectiveness of our method...|$|R

25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> to technique, which left me unsatisfied.” While he {{learned a lot from}} Tinel, whose {{technical}} mastery he greatly admired, he also let himself be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E
25|$|The band {{recorded}} self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Recorded {{within six}} {{hours on a}} four-track, their unique sound and quality of writing gained <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> for the band to tour as support to AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Although several record companies expressed interests in signing the band, no contracts were forthcoming. The band {{was at the time}} managed by Reg Fellows and Sean Harris' mother (Linda Harris),who reportedly turned down an offer from the influential Leiber/Krebs Management. Thus while other new wave of British heavy metal bands were signed to major labels and headlining their own tours Diamond Head remained independent. The management decided that they would release their material through a label owned by Muff Murfin called 'Happy Face Records'. Murfin also owned the studio where Diamond Head did many of their early recordings.|$|E
25|$|His {{exploits}} in {{his single}} season gained him <b>enough</b> <b>attention</b> {{to be brought}} in as the opening batsman for the MCC in 2005 season's opener against County Champions Warwickshire. With a century in the first innings and a near attempt at 97 in the second, Cook helped secure victory in a match destined for a draw. The season opener would not be Cook's only highlight for the year, as the Ashes approached Australia were touring the counties and in a two-day match which did not count towards his first-class statistics, Cook scored a double century went on {{to take the first}} wicket of Justin Langer with a catch in the drawn match days after being awarded PCA Young Cricketer of the Year. A further highlight of the season saw Cook help Essex to score one of Durham's two defeats of the season, scoring 107 of Essex's 245 before taking his maiden first-class wicket, before taking another two, with his off-spin. Cook played in every first-class match for Essex and also helped them clinch the Totesport League Title {{for the first time in}} 20 years. The end of the season saw Cook finish with an average of 48.03 in the County Championship, hitting four centuries.|$|E

Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the popularization {{of mobile}} phones, many people search Web {{contents}} {{using their own}} mobile phones. Since people bring their mobile phones everywhere, they can search Web contents in various situations (e. g., walking and sitting). In particular, when users are walking, they cannot pay <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> to operate their devices {{and it is difficult}} to conduct complicated operations such as character inputting. In addition, users’ search objectives are also affected by the time and their location. To assist content search in such situations, in this paper, we propose a content search support system that presents a few options that enable mobile users to get desired contents easily considering the users’ situations. The system infers users’ situation based on sensory data and presents initial options considering users’ search objective corresponding to the inferred situation. Through a user experiment, we confirmed that participants could get desired information easily by using our system and it was effective to adaptively present options based on the inferred situations...|$|R
40|$|For {{achieving}} the sustainable development, {{it is significant}} to mitigate the human impact over time by preservation and maintenance work around the developed area. At Isahaya bay, Nagasaki, the reclamation project is proceeding now, and Isahaya bay has been separated from original sea. Thus, it is considered that the spatial distribution of tidal flat in this bay will change near future. In this study, in order to investigate {{the impact of the}} construction of sea dyke on the tidal flat, numerical simulations were carried out. Calculated results show that the area of tidal flat becomes small as the decrease of tidal range inside the sea dyke. Furthermore, because of the decreased velocity of current, deposition is occurred in front of the dyke and near the northern shoreline. These results imply that the possibility of an appearance of tidal flat around the Isahaya bay. Otherwise, these areas are affected by the control of gates, the <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> are required to maintain and create the tidal flat...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} has been recognised {{as an important}} topic for the execution of business processes since long time ago. Yet, most exiting works on resource allocation have not paid <b>enough</b> <b>attentions</b> to process characteristics, such as structural and task dependencies. Furthermore, no effort has been made on optimising resource allocation by improving business processes. To address this issue, we propose an approach that optimises the use of resources in an enterprise by exploring the structural features of a business process and adapting the structures of the business process to better fit the resources available in the enterprise. After a motivating example, we describe a role-based business process model for resource allocation. Then we present strategies for resource allocation optimisation and discuss the relationship between resource allocation and business process improvement. A set of heuristic rules are discussed and algorithms based on these rules are designed for optimising resource allocation with a particular optimisation goal...|$|R
