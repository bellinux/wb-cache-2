40|$|ObjectivesThe Fontan-type {{procedure}} {{has undergone}} 2 major modifications, including <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling and extracardiac conduit. To clarify {{the effect of}} these modifications on arrhythmia propensity, we analyzed chronologic changes in P-wave characteristics after atriopulmonary connection, <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling, or extracardiac conduit. MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on electrocardiographic data from 40 patients with tricuspid atresia who underwent the Fontan-type procedure and follow-up for greater than 5 years: 18 had atriopulmonary connection, 13 had <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling, and 9 had extracardiac conduit. The mean follow-up period in years was 19. 8 for atriopulmonary connection, 13. 3 for <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling, and 8. 0 for extracardiac conduit. We analyzed chronologic changes in P-wave duration, dispersion, and amplitude and prevalence of sinus node dysfunction. ResultsAtrial tachyarrhythmia was documented in 9 patients with atriopulmonary connection but not in any patients with extracardiac conduit or <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling. Both P-wave maximum duration and dispersion decreased slightly over time with extracardiac conduit but increased progressively in the <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling and atriopulmonary connection groups. <b>Intra-atrial</b> baffling resulted in significantly shorter P-wave duration than atriopulmonary connection, whereas extracardiac conduit had significantly shorter P-wave duration and smaller dispersion than atriopulmonary connection and <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling. P-wave amplitude decreased markedly immediately after surgical intervention with <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling and extracardiac conduit but remained unchanged in patients undergoing atriopulmonary connection. Sinus node dysfunction was found commonly in all 3 groups. ConclusionAfter <b>intra-atrial</b> baffling, patients increasingly had prolonged P-wave duration and larger dispersion associated with sinus node dysfunction, suggesting a propensity to arrhythmia, although less progressive than seen in those undergoing atriopulmonary connection. In contrast, despite an equal prevalence of sinus node dysfunction after extracardiac conduit, the lack of important changes in P-wave characteristics over time suggests that the extracardiac conduit procedure is the preferred option for optimal rhythm prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to {{differences}} of opinion regarding the upper normal limit of P-wave duration an(l the definition of <b>intra-atrial</b> block. There seems to be good reason for accepting 0. 11 sec. as the upper limit of normal and a P-wave duration of 0. 12 sec. or more as indicative of <b>intra-atrial</b> block. By this criterion 4, 500 consecutix'e electrocardiograms taken in a general hospital were examine(I and the findings are reported. ALTHOUGH proposed definitions of <b>intra-atrial</b> block vary, a number of authorities consider that the criterion for diagnosis is a P wave measuring 0. 12 sec. or longer. ' It is our impression that most electrocardiographers pay {{little attention to the}} duration of the P wave in routine interpreta-tion and consequently have little conception of the relative frequency of <b>intra-atrial</b> block. Systematic scrutiny of the P waves in the course of interpreting records in a general hos-pital has revealed that <b>intra-atrial</b> block, as defined above, is a common finding, accounting for nearly one third of all types of blocks en-countered. The purpose of this commnunication is {{to draw attention to the}} high incidence of <b>intra-atrial</b> block and to discuss criteria for its diagnosis. MIATERIAL AND IMETHODS All electrocardiograms were taken with Sanborn or Cambridge direct-writing instruments. In the course of daily interpretation of inpatient and out-patient records in a general hospital, the duration of P waves was routinely observed in 4, 500 tracings, almost all of which were 12 -lead records. The sole criterion for recording <b>intra-atrial</b> block was the finding in any lead of P waves measuring 0. 12 sec. or more. When notching with peak interval of more than 0. 04 sec. was present it was noted in addition; but where such notching occurred in the absence of a duration of 0. 12 sec., <b>intra-atrial</b> block was not recorded. The difficulties in exact measurement of P-wave duration are well appreciated. We have accepted P-wave prolongation only in those tracings in which the beginning and end of the P waves were clearly distinguishable in at least 1 lead. Where definitio...|$|E

40|$|Background. Information about {{electrophysiological}} {{characteristics and}} radiofrequency ablation of <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia {{has not been}} reported before. We proposed that induction and termination of <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia by atrial extrastimuli or rapid atrial pacing and resetting the response pattern by atrial extrastimuli during <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia could ensure the mechanism of reentry and that the earliest site of endocardial activation and concealed entrainment pace mapping with the shortest stimulus-P wave interval could localize a critical area responsible for <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia and radiofrequency ablation. Methods and Results. Seven patients with refractory atrial tachycardia were referred for electrophysio-logical studies and radiofrequency ablation. Electrophysiological studies and endocardial mapping found (1) 10 atrial foci with atrial tachycardia cycle length of 406 ± 41 ms; (2) atrial tachycardia had induction and termination by atrial extrastimuli (8 of 10) or rapid atrial pacing (10 of 10); (3) atrial tachycardia had increasing (6 of 10) or mixed (flat and increasing, 4 of 10) resetting response pattern, with resetting interval of 57 ± 13 ms (14 ± 4 % of atrial tachycardia cycle length); (4) exit sites of atrial tachycardia in right atrial free wall (6 of 10), right atrial septum (3 of 10), and midposterior left atrium (1 of 10); and (5) earliest activation site had timing relative to P wave by- 37 ± 7 ms, and concealed entrainment pace mapping had shortest stimulus-P interval 23 ± 3 ms. By the endocardial activation pace-mapping technique, radiofrequency energy (8 ± 1 pulses, 31 ± 3 W, 101 ± 11 seconds) successfully eliminated the 10 atrial foci without recurrence (follow-up, 16 + 5 months). Conclusions. Mechanism of <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia could be confirmed by the electrophysi-ological characteristics, and radiofrequency ablation energy delivered to a critical area in the atrial reentrant circuit is safe and effective {{for the treatment of}} <b>intra-atrial</b> reentrant tachycardia.

40|$|Bacterial {{endocarditis}} {{with positive}} blood culture occurred on six occasions {{in a series}} of 140 mitral valve replacements. In three of these, extensive detachment of the prosthesis with severe mitral incompetence resulted. Re-operation was undertaken in two of these cases. <b>Intra-atrial</b> thrombosis occurred twice. In three other cases, in which <b>intra-atrial</b> thrombosis occurred, infection was strongly suspected to have been the responsible factor. Mitral regurgitation presented no difficulty in diagnosis, as all patients had severe congestive cardiac failure and typical physical signs. Confirmation was established by cinéangiography. <b>Intra-atrial</b> thrombosis presented difficulty in diagnosis. A persistently positive blood culture, continued pyrexia, and a history of sepsis were the most consistent and significant findings in the cases reported. The antibiotic regime described by Amoury and his colleagues has been used for the past year. There has not been a single case of bacterial endocarditis, <b>intra-atrial</b> thrombosis, or wound infection in 120 consecutive valve replacements on this regime. Because of the high mortality associated with <b>intra-atrial</b> thrombosis, and the close association between endocarditis and thrombosis, the presence of endocarditis with or without regurgitation might well be a compelling reason for re-operation.

Our goals were 3 -fold: (1) to describe the postoperative temperature course in infants after cardiac surgery, (2) to compare intracardiac temperature monitoring with traditional monitoring in infants, and (3) to determine variables that influence the patients’ temperatures. MethodsLongitudinal temperature data were collected for 100 infants undergoing cardiac surgery. <b>Intra-atrial,</b> nasopharyngeal, esophageal, rectal, and axillary temperatures were recorded in all patients. ResultsThe mean age {{at the time of}} operation was 128 ± 166 days, and the mean weight was 5. 1 ± 2. 4 kg. Circulatory arrest was used for 54 patients. In the operating room, the maximum <b>intra-atrial</b> temperature (37. 5 °C ± 0. 6 °C) was significantly greater than both the simultaneous esophageal temperature (36. 9 °C ± 1. 9 °C, P =. 03) and nasopharyngeal temperature (36. 3 °C ± 2. 5 °C, P <. 001). In the cardiac intensive care unit, <b>intra-atrial</b> temperature was significantly greater than both axillary and rectal temperatures. During the first 24 postoperative hours, <b>intra-atrial</b> temperature was greater than 38 °C in 48 (48 %) patients, rectal temperature was greater than 38 °C in 36 (36 %) patients, and axillary temperature was greater than 38 °C in 7 (7 %) patients.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the hydrodynamic efficiency of extracardiac and <b>intra-atrial</b> lateral tunnel procedures in total cavopulmonary connections. Methods: <b>Intra-atrial</b> lateral tunnel, extracardiac tunnel, and extracardiac conduit with and without caval vein offset were performed on explanted sheep heart preparations and studied in an in vitro flow loop. A rate of fluid-energy dissipation analysis was performed for each model using simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow at each inlet and outlet of the right side of the heart. Preparations were perfused by using a steady flow blood pump at 4 flow indices (1 - 6 L/min/m 2) with the inferior vena cava carrying 65 % of the total venous return. Results: Fluid-power losses were consistently lower for the extracardiac conduit procedure compared with the two tunnel configurations (P <. 01). A further reduction in energy dissipation of up to 36 % was noted in the extracardiac procedure, with 5 mm offset of the extracardiac conduit toward the distal right pulmonary. The <b>intra-atrial</b> and extracardiac tunnel procedures were least efficient, with losses 73 % greater than the optimal extracardiac conduit procedure. Conclusions: The extracardiac conduit procedure provides superior hemodynamics compared with the <b>intra-atrial</b> lateral tunnel and extracardiac tunnel techniques. This hydrodynamic advantage is markedly enhanced by the use of conduit–superior vena cava offset, particularly at high physiologic flows that are representative of exercise.

40|$|In 1989, two {{patients}} were operated for deep septal "parahisian" pathways in our institution. Three different mapping techniques were used. (1) Epicardial activation mapping with a belt of 21 bipolar electrodes positioned around the heart. This belt was positioned {{either on the}} atrial or on the ventricular side of the atrioventricular annulus in order to localize both the atrial and the ventricular insertion of the bypass tract. (2) Right <b>intra-atrial</b> activation mapping on the normothermic beating heart with a bipolar hand-held probe. (3) Right <b>intra-atrial</b> cryomapping at 0 degrees C. The "parahisian" pathways are remote from the epicardium and the pattern of epicardial activation {{is different from that}} of the free-wall pathways. Case 1 : The electrophysiological study showed a concealed anteroseptal bypass tract. The peroperative atrial epicardial mapping during orthodromic tachycardia (OT) showed simultaneous activation of the posteroseptal area and of the basis of the right appendage. Right <b>intra-atrial</b> mapping during OT showed an anteroseptal "parahisian" pathway. Case 2 : The ECG and electrophysiological study showed a right posterior pathway. The first site of epicardial ventricular activation during atrial stimulation was the right posterior area, 30 ms after the onset of the delta wave. The first site of epicardial atrial activation during OT was the posteroseptal area. The right <b>intra-atrial</b> mapping showed a posteroseptal "parahisian" bypass tract. This localization was confirmed with cryomapping.

MethodsThis single center observational study included 25 patients with severe MS (aged 34. 1 ± 7. 1 years, with mean mitral valve area (MVA) of 0. 74 ± 0. 13 cm 2), in sinus rhythm, who underwent successful PTMC at our hospital. P-wave dispersion (PWD) was calculated by subtracting minimum P-wave duration (Pmin) from maximum P-wave duration (Pmax), measured on a 12 -lead surface ECG obtained from each patient in supine position at a paper speed of 50 mm/s and 20 mm/mV. Inter-atrial (AEMD), left <b>intra-atrial</b> (L-IAEMD), and right <b>intra-atrial</b> (R-IAEMD) electromechanical delays were measured on tissue Doppler imaging. PTMC was performed using the standard Inoue Balloon technique. All these parameters were evaluated and compared before and 24 – 48 h after PTMC. ResultsSuccessful PTMC led to significant reduction in AEMD (p< 0. 001), L-IAEMD (p< 0. 001), and R-IAEMD (p< 0. 001). There were no changes in Pmax, Pmin, and PWD immediately after PTMC. ConclusionsSuccessful PTMC has a favorable early impact on inter- and <b>intra-atrial</b> electromechanical delays, which are considered as novel parameters of atrial electromechanical remodeling in MS patients.

MethodsThis prospective randomized blinded trial was conducted in patients with congenital heart disease undergoing an initial lateral tunnel Fontan. Intervention patients underwent a lateral tunnel Fontan with an interventional atrial incision/cryoablation from the atriotomy to the right atrioventricular annulus. Controls underwent a standard lateral tunnel Fontan. Safety of the intervention was monitored. Short-term efficacy was determined by comparisons of conduction block across the incision area and spontaneous or inducible atrial arrhythmias. ResultsThere were no significant differences between intervention (n = 21, median 2. 4 years, range 0. 8 - 3. 9) and controls (n = 21, median 2. 7 years, range 1. 5 - 13. 9) in age, type of heart disease, surgical parameters, or postoperative outcomes. Safety parameters showed no difference between groups in number or severity of adverse events. Short-term efficacy included evidence of conduction block with a longer conduction time across the incision area in intervention patients (median 97 ms, range 35 - 160) compared with controls (median 40 ms, range 8 - 77, P =. 0001).

Here, we examined the relation between SCN 5 A mutations, atrial conduction velocity, atrial structural changes, and atrial ectopic activity in BrS. Data from 214 BrS patients [78 with an SCN 5 A mutation (patients with an SCN 5 A mutation, BrSSCN 5 A+) and 136 without an SCN 5 A mutation (patients without an SCN 5 A mutation, BrSSCN 5 A-) ] were collected. <b>Intra-atrial</b> conduction velocity was assessed by measuring P-wave durations at baseline and during sodium channel provocation testing. Atrial structural changes were assessed by measuring atrial dimensions using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Atrial ectopic activity was assessed by determining the incidence of atrial ectopic beats using 24 h Holter recordings. Clinical characteristics (including AFib occurrence) did not differ between BrSSCN 5 A+ and BrSSCN 5 A-.

We describe {{a case of a}} 41 -year-old patient in whom an Amplatzer septal occluder device was used to close a moderately large ASD and who subsequently developed incessant <b>intra-atrial</b> macro-reenterant tachycardia. The tachycardia was terminated by radiofrequency ablation guided by electroanatomical mapping...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{techniques}} to quantify the propagation pattern of the electrical activation during atrial fibrillation (AF) along a one-dimensional catheter. Taking <b>intra-atrial</b> signal organization aspects into account, the atrial activations are detected and combined into wavefronts. Parameters describing wavefront consistency and activation order along the catheter are defined, and the relationship of wavefront consistency to body surface parameters, namely AF frequency and exponential decay, is investigated. The database consisted of 26 10 -s recordings from patients during drug-refractory AF, in which five adjacent bipolar electrograms from a catheter in the right atrium were recorded. The 12 -lead ECG was recorded simultaneously. The degree of wavefront consistency provided insights into the temporal variability of the activation order, an aspect which was not reflected by the body surface parameters. However, AF frequency was able to distinguish between recordings with different degrees of <b>intra-atrial</b> signal organization (p = 0. 008) ...|$|E

The lesion had the pathological appearance of an atrial myxoma and seemed to have developed after trauma to the <b>intra-atrial</b> septum. This case suggests that at least some atrial myxomas are reactive rather than neoplastic in origin...|$|E

40|$|The extracardiac conduit type {{of total}} cavopulmonary {{connection}} (TCPC) {{is the most}} common variation of the modified Fontan operation in current use. For patients with some forms of complex anatomy (eg, dextrocardia in situs solitus or asplenia syndrome), we have adopted a different technique: interposition of an <b>intra-atrial</b> conduit between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the superior vena cava–right pulmonary artery (SVC-RPA) connection.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{characterization}} of simultaneous <b>intra-atrial</b> and ECG recordings during atrial fibrillation (AF) is presented. With different preprocessing, {{both types of}} signals are characterized using a logarithmic time-frequency distribution from which trends of frequency, regularity, morphology (only ECG) and signal quality are extracted. The objective {{of the study is}} to relate ECG measures of rate and morphology to measures of <b>intra-atrial</b> organisation. The algorithm has been tested on a database with simultaneous ECG and right atrial recordings from 34 patients with drug-refractory AF. The average frequency in lead V 1 was 5. 91 Hz (std= 0. 94) and the average exponential decay of harmonic magnitudes (reflecting the morphology) in V 1 was 1. 31 (std= 0. 38); their correlation coefficient was 0. 53 (p< 0. 001). The correlation coefficient between spatial frequency dispersion in the right atrium and harmonic decay was 0. 53 (p< 0. 005). More organized AF, observed in patients treated with amiodarone, was reflected by a lower frequency, smaller right atrial frequency dispersion and lower exponential decay. 1...|$|E
40|$|Vascular {{thrombosis}} is a harmful {{and rather}} frequent event in sick premature infants. Only recently has intracardiac thrombosis {{been described in}} preterm babies and virtually all the surviving cases are those treated surgically. We report the cases of two premature infants with <b>intra-atrial</b> thrombosis detected by cross-sectional echocardiography and successfully treated with heparin and urokinase for 12 and 16 days, respectively. Our patients required larger doses ofurokinase {{over a longer period}} of time than are required at older ages to obtain thrombolysis. Our data suggest that fibrinolytic therapy may be an alternative to surgery in premature babies with right atrial thrombosis and that cross-sectional echocardiography is very useful in the titration of the therapy in order to achieve consistent dissolution of the thrombus. Vascular thrombosis has been reported as a harm-ful event in sick premature infants' 1 - 3). Nevertheless, only recently has intracardiac thrombosis been des-cribed in preterm babies.
