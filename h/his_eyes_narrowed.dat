60|$|Furley nodded. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed,</b> {{and little}} lines {{appeared}} at their corners.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> dangerously. There was a faint domineering {{smile on}} his face.|$|E
60|$|He {{withdrew a}} little into himself. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed.</b> His manner became more cautious.|$|E
60|$|Thurid {{turned toward}} Xodar, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> to two nasty slits.|$|R
60|$|Dredlinton {{stood and}} glared at <b>his</b> wife, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing,</b> <b>his</b> mean little mouth curled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be you De Montfort's daughter, niece of King Henry?" [...] queried Norman of Torn, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> to mere slits {{and face}} hardening.|$|R
60|$|The man sized him {{up quickly}} {{from head to}} foot. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and his brows contracted.|$|E
60|$|Feversham misliked Sir Rowland's arrogant tone, misliked his angry, scornful glance. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed,</b> the {{laughter}} faded slowly from his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chambers. I'll be damned." [...] <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed.</b> [...] "What are {{you doing}} here?" [...] He came into the dining-room. Doris drew her robe about her helplessly, backing away.|$|E
60|$|Blue {{paused a}} moment, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> down, <b>his</b> whole face setting in hard cast of intense preoccupation, {{as if he}} visualized a scene of {{extraordinary}} nature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me the note," [...] he snapped. Setting {{down his}} pen, he thrust out an unclean paw to snatch the folded sheet from Simonne's hand. He spread it, and read, his bloodless lips compressed, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> to slits.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he said, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing.</b> [...] "And {{the fear}} of this, then, {{is the source of}} thy whim to acquire her for thyself. Thou art not subtle, O Fenzileh. The {{consciousness}} that thine own charms are fading sets thee trembling lest so much loveliness should entirely cast thee from thy lord's regard, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly." [...] MacNelly {{removed his}} cigar. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and glittered. The muscles along his brown cheeks set hard and tense. He leaned closer to Duane, laid sinewy, {{pressing}} fingers upon Duane's knee.|$|E
6000|$|The boy grew {{pale and}} then red. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> {{as he stared}} fixedly at the officer. But he did not change his position, nor did he betray either fear or agitation. In a voice quite unmoved he asked: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> {{a little}} {{as he looked at}} her closely. From across the table, the Bishop broke off an {{interesting}} discussion on the subject of his addresses to the working classes, and the Earl set down his wineglass with an impatient gesture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] Phipps murmured. [...] "That's bad. Of course," [...] he went on, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowing</b> {{a little}} as he watched his {{companion}} closely, as though to estimate the effect of his words, [...] "of course, I knew that Lord Dredlinton had other interests in life besides his domestic ones, but I {{had no idea that}} he carried things to such a length." ...|$|R
60|$|Bob smiled, but <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> got <b>narrower</b> and <b>his</b> mouth went straight. He {{was a big}} man {{and carried}} himself like an athlete.|$|R
60|$|Thuvan Dihn smiled his {{appreciation}} of the marvellous device. The forward servant pushed almost to the flier's side. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>narrowed</b> to slits.|$|R
6000|$|As Tarzan {{ascended the}} {{platform}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> angrily {{at the sight}} which met them. The basin hollowed {{in the top of}} the altar was filled with water in which floated the naked corpse of a new-born babe. [...] "What means this?" [...] he cried angrily, turning upon Lu-don.|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} glance <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and his muscles tensed. Even at that {{distance}} {{he could see}} that something was amiss. A thin spiral of smoke arose at the right of the bungalow where the barns had stood, but there were no barns there now, and from the bungalow chimney from which smoke should have arisen, there arose nothing.|$|E
60|$|A sudden, tense silence {{fell upon}} the {{assembled}} chiefs. Slowly the blood receded from the sinister face of O-Tar, Jeddak of Manator, leaving him a sickly purple in his wrath. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> to two thin slits, {{his lips were}} compressed to a bloodless line of malevolence. For a long moment {{there was no sound}} in the throne room of the palace at Manator. Then the jeddak turned toward U-Dor.|$|E
60|$|Sheik Amor ben Khatour drew {{himself up}} to his full height. <b>His</b> evil <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed.</b> He raised the bag of gold level with {{the eyes of the}} French officer.|$|R
60|$|Charles {{smoothed}} {{his black}} beard thoughtfully, <b>his</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and pensive. There {{must be a}} victim, to strike fear into Giovanna's friends and stir them to Charles's purposes.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>narrowed.</b> Through <b>his</b> {{spectacles}} he {{was watching}} intently for the effect of his words. Hunterleys, however, only nodded thoughtfully, as though to some extent impressed by the advice he had received.|$|R
60|$|Oda Yorimoto {{watched the}} white men upon the beach. Also, he watched the white girl--even more, possibly, than he watched the men. He saw the shelter that was being built, {{and when it was}} {{complete}} he saw the girl enter it, and he knew that it was for her alone. Oda Yorimoto sucked in his lips and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> even more than nature had intended that they should.|$|E
60|$|As Metak {{entered and}} the men {{recognized}} him they arose, and in answer to a query he put, they pointed to an arched doorway {{at the rear of}} the room. Toward this Metak led the girl, and then, as though filled with a sudden suspicion, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> cunningly and turning toward the soldiery he issued an order which resulted in their all preceding him through the small doorway and up a flight of stairs a short distance beyond.|$|E
6000|$|A light {{broke in}} on the Supervisor's brain. In {{the midst of his}} preoccupation as a {{forester}} he suddenly became the father. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> and his face darkened. [...] "That's so. The old rip could make a whole lot of capital out of your being left in camp that way. At the same time I don't believe in dodging. The worst thing we could do would be to try to blind the trail. Was Tony here last night when you came?" ...|$|E
60|$|Hobson's square jaw was set {{a little}} tighter, and <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed.|$|R
60|$|He {{imagined}} the other understood {{the significance of}} this, for <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> momentarily <b>narrowed.</b> It was strange, but they now looked blue. For all that, he poured out a liberal measure of whisky and drank slowly, like a connoisseur.|$|R
60|$|His sallow {{cheeks were}} paler than ever. <b>His</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes,</b> furtively raised to Wrayson's, {{were full of}} {{inquisitive}} fear.|$|R
60|$|A single look he took at {{the stones}} lying in his hand. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed,</b> a curse broke from his lips, and he hurled the small objects upon the ground, disdainfully. Quickly he emptied {{the balance of}} the {{contents}} until he had scanned each separate stone, and as he dumped them all upon the ground and stamped upon them his rage grew until the muscles of his face worked in demon-like fury, and his fingers clenched until his nails bit into the flesh.|$|E
6000|$|The old Arab {{met them}} at the {{entrance}} to his tent. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> wickedly when they had appraised the newcomers. They stopped before him, exchanging greetings. They had come to trade for ivory they said. The Sheik grunted. He had no ivory. Meriem gasped. She knew that in a near-by hut the great tusks were piled almost to the roof. She poked her little head further forward {{to get a better view}} of the strangers. How white their skins! How yellow their great beards! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know naught of Helium and O-Tar is our warlord," [...] replied E-Med; [...] "but I do {{know that}} I would examine more closely the prize that I shall play for and win. I would test the lips of her who is to be my slave after the next games; nor is it well, woman, to drive me too far to anger." [...] <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> as he spoke, his visage taking on the semblance of that of a snarling beast. [...] "If you doubt the truth of my words ask Lan-O, the slave girl." ...|$|E
60|$|Beside the pimalia stood Astok, <b>his</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> to mere slits of hate {{beneath his}} {{lowering}} brows {{as he watched}} the retreating forms of the woman who had aroused the fiercest passions of his nature and the man whom he now believed {{to be the one who}} stood between his love and its consummation.|$|R
60|$|Captain Jacot {{eyed the}} newcomer. He was acquainted with nearly every {{principal}} Arab within a radius {{of several hundred}} miles. This man he never had seen. He was a tall, weather beaten, sour looking man of sixty or more. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>narrow</b> and evil. Captain Jacot did not relish his appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "One imagines {{that you}} did not know Don Martin," [...] Gomez said lightly, {{although}} there was a keen look in <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
