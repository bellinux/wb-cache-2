The formation of social networks among traders is a horizontal network, based on kinship ar friendship. They have the same resources and obligations to be exchanged. The social relationship itself will be manifested in help each others. The social networks formed through kinship has important role to overcome social pressures, poverty, unemployment and limited access in getting economic resources.

Moreover, the changing role of women and their ever increasing participation in the labour force outside the home, further diminishes their availability as caregivers.

When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents, and transacts directly only with those it trusts, the formation game is a potential game and all Nash equilibria are social optima.

40|$|The use of personal, {{sensitive}} information, such as {{privileges and}} attributes, {{to gain access}} to computer resources in distributed environments raises an interesting paradox. On one hand, {{in order to make the}} services and resources accessible to legitimate users, access control infrastructure requires valid and provable service clients' identities or attributes to make decisions. On the other hand, the service clients may not be prepared to disclose their identity information or attributes to a remote party without determining in advance whether the service provider can be trusted with such sensitive information. Moreover, when clients give out personal information, they still are unsure of the extent of propagation and use of the information. This thesis describes an investigation of privacy preserving options in access control infrastructures, and proposes a security model to support the management of those options, based on extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and Security Access Markup Language (SAML), both of which are OASIS security standards. Existing access control systems are typically unilateral in that the enterprise service provider assigns the access rights and makes the access control decisions, and there is no negotiation between the client and the service provider. As access control management systems lean towards being user-centric or federated, unilateral approaches can no longer adequately preserve the client's privacy, particularly where communicating parties have no pre-existing trust relationship. As a result, a unified approach that significantly improves privacy and confidentiality protection in distributed environments was considered. This resulted in the development of XACML Trust Management Authorization Infrastructure (XTMAI) designed to handle privacy and confidentiality mutually and simultaneously using the concept <b>of</b> <b>Obligation</b> <b>of</b> Trust (OoT) protocol. The OoT enables two or more transaction parties to <b>exchange</b> Notice <b>of</b> <b>Obligations</b> (NoB) (obligating constraints) as well as Signed Acceptance <b>of</b> <b>Obligation</b> (SAO), a proof of acceptance, as security assurances before <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> sensitive resources.

Companies were able to sell protection to investors against the default of mortgage-backed securities, helping to launch and expand the market for new, complex instruments such as CDO's. This further fueled the housing bubble. They also amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread these bets throughout the financial system. Companies selling protection, such as AIG, were not required to set aside sufficient capital to cover their obligations when significant defaults occurred.

Most approaches to this concept ignore the role of context in shaping its features. However, others have pointed out the need to evaluate the features of the construct within the context in which it is studied. Three salient features of the construct include {{the use of the term}} “promises” versus “obligations”, its implicit nature and reference to the “other” party, and the exchange content. Rousseau and Schalk suggest that these features are weighted and interpreted differently across different countries. The purpose of this paper is to test this proposition in the island state of Malta, a European Union micro-state. Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews are used. Three questions are addressed: do employment obligations vary from promises in this context? Are employment obligations in this context necessarily explicited?

Findings – The results show that some findings are similar to those found in other settings (e. g. acknowledgement <b>of</b> an <b>exchange</b> relationship in employment), others are more context-bound (e. g. the meaning <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> as predicting future reciprocal behaviours compared to promises). The paper also shows that many of these understandings are related to and construed by the way the employment relationship is construed in a country like Malta.

40|$|The Community Based Policing {{model has}} been adopted by the large {{majority}} of policing agencies as another tool on an officer’s duty belt that allows them to do their job more effectively and efficiently. The model is premised on the building and maintaining of relationships of the Police Service and the community it serves. The model argues that Services must ensure that the community is given a voice in the way police enforce the laws. The model encourages that the police and community work together in a partnership that is different from the traditional relationship shared between the two groups under the previous Professional Policing model. This working in partnership means that not only must the police become more open to the community providing direction in the way they do their job, but also that the community must take {{a more active role in}} the policing of their areas. This partnership could be considered an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> information from both the police and the community. As argued by Marcel Mauss in The Gift, relationships that are on-going and have elements <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> have <b>obligations.</b> These <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> giving, receiving and reciprocity ensure that the relationship between the groups is not only maintained, but strengthened. When one <b>of</b> these <b>obligations</b> is not met, however, there are often social consequences.

40|$|Dalam kontrak komersial, perdebatan “semu” mengenai “keadilan dan keseimbangan” yang berujung pada “ketidakadilan dan ketidakseimbangan” posisi para kontraktan pada dasarnya tidak relevan lagi untuk diungkapkan.

Sementara itu, hasil pertukaran kepentingan para kontraktan dianggap adil apabila berlangsung secara proporsional. Proporsionalitas pertukaran hak dan kewajiban dalam kontrak komersial tidak menuntut hasil yang selalu seimbang-sama (equilibrium-matematis), oleh karenanya perbedaan hasil dianggap adil dan diterima secara wajar apabila proses pertukaran hak dan kewajiban berlangsung proporsional. Penerapan asas proporsionalitas dalam seluruh mata rantai proses kontraktual pada dasarnya merupakan perwujudan doktrin “keadilan berkontrak” yang dianut dan dikembangkan dewasa ini.   In commercial contracts, {{the debates}} about 'fairness and balance' {{that led to}} the 'injustice and imbalance' position of the parties basically irrelevant to be disclosed.
