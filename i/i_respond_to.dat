But <b>I</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the lightest touch of a {{friendly}} hand, I think I may say; and I haven't the slightest fear of breaking any spell in saying--to you--that I seem to myself just now (absit omen!) to fonctionner pretty well.

I never had more intentions--what do I say?--more ferocities; I am sitting in my boat and my oars rhythmically creak. In short I propose to win my little battle--and even believe, more than hitherto, that I may annex my little province. It will be as small as the Grand Duchy of Pumpernickel--but there will be room {{to put up a}} friend. Therefore you must come and stay with me there; in fact I give you rendez-vous on the battlefield itself, the moment the day is declared. I mix my metaphors--but it all means that it's all a fight and that the only thing that changes is our fighting train. Let us then fight side by side, never too far out of sight.|$|E

6000|$|I have a {{beautiful}} Xmas letter from you and <b>I</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> it on the spot. It tells me charming things of you--such as your moving majestically from one beautiful home to another, apparently still more beautiful; such as the flow of your inspiration never having been more various and more torrential--and all so deliciously remunerated an inspiration; such as your having been on to dear C. E. N.'S obsequies--what a Cambridge date that, even for you and me--and having also found time to see and [...] "appreciate" [...] my dear collaterals, of the two generations (aren't they extraordinarily good and precious collaterals?); such, finally, as your recognising, with so fine a charity, a [...] "message" [...] in the poor little old [...] "Siege of London," [...] which, in all candour, affects me as pretty dim and rococo, though I did lately find, in going over it, that it holds quite well together, and I touched it up where I could.

I've just had the pleasure of hearing from the Scribners that though the Edition began to appear some 13 or 14 months ago, there is, on the volumes already out, no penny of profit owing me--of that profit to which I had partly been looking to pay my New Year's bills! It will have landed me in Bankruptcy--unless it picks up; for it has prevented my doing any other work whatever; which indeed must now begin. I have fortunately broken ground on an American novel, but when you draw my ear to the liquid current of your own promiscuous abundance and facility--a flood of many affluents--I seem to myself to wander by contrast in desert sands. And I find our art, all the while, more difficult of practice, and want, with that, to do it in a more and more difficult way; it being really, at bottom, only difficulty that interests me. Which is a most accursed way to be constituted.
