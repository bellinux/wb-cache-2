5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and <b>I,</b> <b>attended</b> by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the open {{mainstream}} camp, not terrorist camps. I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

25|$|When Warwick {{presented}} the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of Robots {{in the year}} 2000, the lectures were well received by some. However, in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is {{a danger to the}} public perception of science. Due to Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} itself {{received}} mostly unfavorable reviews, most critics praised the actingincluding Renoir's, {{and only the}} far right-wing press criticized Marcel Dalio's performance. In July 1939 a right-wing French newspaper criticized the film for portraying the Jewish Marquis married to the Austrian Christine. The Union Sacrée, a French clerical fascist group, organized demonstrations wherever the film was screened. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the Communist Party, which made him unpopular in the tense weeks before World War II began. Years later Renoir said [...] "there was no question of contrivance; my enemies {{had nothing to do}} with its failure. At every session <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> I could feel the unanimous disapproval of the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|To the contrary, Owen Gleiberman, {{film critic}} for the Entertainment Weekly, wrote: [...] "Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major {{characters}} – or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity – to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time." [...] In his review for the Indy Week, David Fellerath wrote: [...] "Django Unchained shows signs that Tarantino did little research beyond repeated viewings of Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western Django and a blaxploitation from 1975 called Boss Nigger, written by and starring Fred Williamson." [...] New Yorkers Anthony Lane was [...] "disturbed by their [...] yelps of triumphant laughter, at the screening <b>I</b> <b>attended,</b> as a white woman was blown away by Django's guns." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{faculty of}} the Franz Liszt Academy {{included}} {{some of the most}} eminent Hungarian musicians, including Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner, Ernő Dohnányi and Zoltán Kodály. Solti studied under the first three, for piano, chamber music and composition respectively. Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály, but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály, whom he would have preferred, turned him down, leaving him to study composition first with Albert Siklós and then with Dohnányi. Not all the Academy's tutors were equally distinguished: Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernö Unger, [...] "who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions. <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the class for only two years, but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before I managed to unlearn what he had taught me".|$|E
500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E

30|$|Research on the {{diffusion}} of innovation has clearly demonstrated that the communication channels utilized by adopters influence their level of awareness and adoption of EBIPs (Rogers 2003). A portion of our survey asked faculty to indicate {{the extent to which}} they relied on various communication channels (e.g., academic journals, fellow faculty members, etc.) for advice about teaching. Participants indicated how frequently they utilized these resources using the following Likert scale: (0) Not Applicable, (1) Never/Rarely, (2) Sometimes, (3) Often, (4) Always. In addition, our survey asked faculty how often they attended a number of professional conferences that have some focus on teaching. Participants indicated their conference attendance using the following rating scale: (1) I have never heard of it/I have heard the name but <b>I</b> have never <b>attended,</b> (2) <b>I</b> have <b>attended</b> it once or twice in the past, (3) <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> this conference regularly, (4) <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> every conference offering.
