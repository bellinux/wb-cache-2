5|$|A {{secret trust}} must be contrasted with merely placing a moral {{obligation}} upon the beneficiary {{to deal with the}} legacy in particular way (as in Re Snowden) and must impose a binding obligation, without discretion to act within <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> or not.|$|E
5|$|If {{a secret}} trust cannot be established, the {{beneficiary}} will hold outright. If a secret trust can be shown, but not <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> (or communication post-dated the testator's death), then the would-be trustee will hold on resulting trust for the testator's estate.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain and Daladier {{returned}} to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement. The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day. At 12:30pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to <b>its</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following a {{preliminary}} peace in 1712, the Treaty of Utrecht ended {{the war in}} 1713. It resulted in the French ceding to Britain the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland, while retaining Cape Breton and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some of <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> were ambiguous, and concerns of various Indian tribes {{were not included in}} the treaty, setting the stage for future conflicts.|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} repeals by {{implication}} are not favored, but we cannot escape the conclusion that, tested by its scope, its obvious purpose, and <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> the act of March 3, 1891, covers the whole subject-matter under consideration, and furnishes the exclusive rule in respect of appellate jurisdiction on appeal, writ of error or certificate.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol {{fulfilled}} the main {{demands of the}} Northern Epirote side. According to <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> the two provinces of Korytsa and Argyrokastron, which constituted Northern Epirus, would become autonomous under Albanian sovereignty and {{under the auspices of}} Prince William of Wied; he, however, was granted no effective power whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|There comes a {{time when}} the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further {{exceptions}} restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour.|$|E
5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 – but {{in direct}} contradiction of <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> – the Swedish {{government}} in 1683 {{demanded that the}} leading social groups of Skåneland accept Swedish customs and laws. Swedish became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. However the last Danish bishop, Peder Winstrup remained {{in charge of the}} Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further Swedish assimilation, the University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in Copenhagen University until the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|His {{successor}} James IV successfully {{ended the}} quasi-independent {{rule of the}} Lord of the Isles, bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time. In 1503, he married Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII of England, thus laying {{the foundation for the}} seventeenth century Union of the Crowns. However, in 1512 the Auld Alliance was renewed and under <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> when the French were attacked by the English under Henry VIII the next year, James IV invaded England in support. The invasion was stopped decisively at the Battle of Flodden during which the King, many of his nobles, and a large number of ordinary troops were killed. Once again Scotland's government lay in the hands of regents {{in the name of the}} infant James V.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken <b>its</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the UK National Consumer Council (NCC, now Consumer Focus) {{called on}} the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to {{investigate}} Apple's EULA, claiming Apple's EULA, and those of multiple other technology companies, misled consumers and infringed legal rights. The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others. The OFT determined the licensing agreements were unfair and Apple agreed to improve <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions to make them clearer and fairer to consumers.|$|E

5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} that Britain had violated <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to call off the siege at the end of June.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1918, the Armistice took effect; {{according}} to <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> eleven battleships and five battlecruisers {{were to be}} interned in Scapa Flow {{for the duration of}} negotiations for the peace treaty. Posen was not among the ships interned, and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December. The ships in Scapa Flow were scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the Allies. As a result, Posen and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had been lost. On 5 November, Posen was stricken from the German navy list to be handed over to Great Britain. The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920; on 1 November 1920, she was driven ashore at Hawkcraig, Fife, Scotland. The British subsequently sold Posen to ship-breakers in the Netherlands. She was broken up in Dordrecht in 1922.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 2009, the Government {{announced}} that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, <b>its</b> <b>terms</b> of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} February, {{the warring}} parties reached a compromise. Under <b>its</b> <b>terms,</b> Modell {{would be allowed}} to take his personnel to Baltimore, but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise that would take the field no later than 1999. The $175 million earmarked for stadium improvements was to be used instead build a new stadium, with up to $48 million of additional financial assistance from the NFL. Further, Modell was ordered to pay Cleveland $9.3 million to compensate for lost revenues and taxes during the Browns' three years of inactivity, plus up to $2.25 million of the city's legal fees. As a result of the deal Modell's team was technically an expansion franchise, called the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E
