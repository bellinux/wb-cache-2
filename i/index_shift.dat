40|$|In a loop, the {{parallelism}} is {{bad when}} the {{statements in the}} loop body {{are involved in a}} datadependence cycle. How to break data-dependence cycles is the key point for increasing the parallelism of loop execution. In this paper, we consider the data-dependence relation in the viewpoint of statements. We propose two new methods, the modi ed <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> method and the statement substitution-shift method. They have better parallelism and performance than the <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> method in general. The modi ed <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> method is obtained from modifying the <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> method and combining with the loop distribution method. The statement substitution-shift method is obtained from combining the statement substitution method, the <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> method and the unimodular transformation method with the loop distribution method.

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of <b>indexed</b> <b>shifting,</b> {{the width of a}} five-speed or compact six freewheel was approximately 32 mm; {{the introduction}} of <b>indexed</b> <b>shifting</b> supposedly made standardized sprocket spacing necessary. Shimano and Campagnolo both came up with independent standards, and SRAM later followed Shimano's lead in respect to sprocket spacing and cassette width. The width of early Shimano six- and seven-speed cassettes was 36 mm, and early eight-speed 40 mm wide. Shimano then changed again and standardised eight-eleven speed cassettes on 41.5 mm and second generation seven-speed to 38 mm. The widening of the sprocket carrier on the cassette hubs to 41.5 mm resulted in a decrease in the distance between the hub flanges.|$|R
40|$|Fully {{reconfigurable}} metasurfaces {{would enable}} new classes of optical devices that provide unprecedented control of electromagnetic beamforms. The principal challenge for achieving reconfigurability {{is the need}} to generate large tunability of subwavelength, low-Q metasurface resonators. Here, we demonstrate large refractive index tuning can be efficiently facilitated at mid-infrared wavelengths using novel temperature-dependent control over free-carrier refraction. In doped InSb we demonstrate nearly two-fold increase in the electron effective mass leading to a positive refractive <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> (Δn> 1. 5) far greater than conventional thermo-optic effects. In undoped films we demonstrate more than 10 -fold change in the thermal free-carrier concentration producing a near-unity negative refractive <b>index</b> <b>shift.</b> Exploiting both effects within a single resonator system, intrinsic InSb wires on a heavily doped (epsilon near zero) InSb substrate, we demonstrate dynamically tunable Mie resonances. The observed larger than line-width resonance shifts (Δλ> 1. 5 μm) suggest new avenues for highly tunable and reconfigurable mid-infrared semiconductor metasurfaces. Comment: 24 page...|$|E

Another design innovation was the first practical Japanese freehub — the Unit-Hub - which combined freewheel and hub in one component (unit hubs were available at least as early as the 1938 Bayliss-Wiley, probably earlier). The freehub greatly increased the strength of the rear wheel, but the idea was not pursued.|$|R

For positive kappa, however, there are some exceptional values for c, and in general an <b>index</b> <b>shift</b> between the eigenvalues of H_ 0 {{and the limits of}} eigenvalues of H_a appears, accompanied with additional oscillations of the eigenfunctions of H_a very close to the origin...|$|E
50|$|In 1987, SunTour {{introduced}} its new attempt at an <b>indexed</b> <b>shifting</b> system, AccuShift. AccuShift came {{late to the}} market to compete with Shimano's new SIS system introduced two years before, which cost SunTour dearly. With two years of lead time, Shimano could afford to require that bicycle manufacturers equip their bikes with complete SIS shifting systems, minimizing problems with product compatibility. SunTour, on the other hand, desperately needed orders, so the company could not insist on complete SunTour component groups that had been tested to ensure compatibility with AccuShift. As a consequence, major bicycle manufacturers such as Schwinn and Raleigh installed Accu-Shift on low-end bikes using inventories of older freewheels, hubs, cables, cable housings, and chains from other manufacturers. The practice resulted in a mismatched 'system' that did not provide the critical tolerances needed for reliable <b>indexed</b> <b>shifting.</b>|$|R
