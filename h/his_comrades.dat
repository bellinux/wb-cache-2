5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E
5|$|Every year, on 5 March (his birthday) and 27 October (the {{day of his}} assassination), Sargsyan is commemorated in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. <b>His</b> <b>comrades</b> {{from the}} Yerkrapah Volunteer Union, high state {{officials}} and many others visit the Yerablur cemetery, where Sargsyan is buried next to many Armenian military figures.|$|E
5|$|Gröning {{claims that}} this {{disrupted}} the relative tranquility his job gave {{him and he}} claims he yet again complained to his superior. His boss, an SS-Untersturmführer, listened but {{reminded him of the}} pledge that he and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> made. Gröning thus returned to work. He has declared that he manipulated his life at Auschwitz so as to avoid witnessing the camp's most unpalatable aspects.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Artemis {{is finally}} granted the ransom. The gold is sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity— {{she has been}} living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> with sleeping pills.|$|E
5|$|Callaghan's name {{is listed}} on Tablets of the Missing at Manila American Cemetery in the Philippines. Callaghan Hall at Officer Training Command, Newport, Rhode Island, is named in his honor. The Callaghan Fitness Center at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth Virginia is also named for him. A street, Admiral Callaghan Lane in Vallejo, California, is also named after him, and a {{monument}} in Lands End, San Francisco (including {{part of the}} bridge of the USS San Francisco, where he died), honors him and <b>his</b> <b>comrades.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 1951, PFC Edward Gomez (1932–1951), an Ammunition Bearer in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division, voluntarily {{moved down}} an {{abandoned}} trench {{to search for}} a new location for his machine gun and, when a hostile grenade landed between himself and his weapon, he shouted a warning to those around him as he grasped the activated charge in his hand. Determined to save <b>his</b> <b>comrades,</b> he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and, diving into a ditch with the deadly missile, absorbed the violence of the explosion in his own body.|$|E

In 1934, Nell gave birth to their second child, a girl named Clementine. Between 1929 and 1939, Murray wrote fifteen articles for Reveille, the magazine of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSL), detailing several of his experiences during the First World War, and praising several of <b>his</b> <b>comrades.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik October/November Revolution on 7 November {{transferred}} {{political power}} in Petrograd to the radical, left-wing socialists. The Germans' intrigue, based on idea that Lenin was the most powerful weapon they could launch against Russia, to finance the Bolsheviks and arrange safe conduct of Lenin and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> from exile in Switzerland to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at Brest-Litovsk.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a family}} with a strong {{military}} background, Romesha joined the U.S. Army in 1999, and was posted at various times in Germany, South Korea and Colorado. Trained as an M1 Abrams tank crewman, Romesha had seen four deployments, including to Kosovo, Iraq twice, and Afghanistan. On October 3, 2009, {{he was assigned to}} the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, deployed to Combat Outpost Keating in eastern Afghanistan. When a force of 300 Taliban insurgents attacked the base, Romesha was credited with rallying <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> and leading the counterattack, directing close air support and providing suppressive fire to help the wounded to an aid station. Despite being wounded, Romesha continued to fight through the 12-hour battle.|$|E

5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E

5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E

5|$|For his {{achievements}} on 28February, the RAF's most successful {{day of the}} campaign, Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Italian sources recorded that a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 was only damaged on 28February, not shot down, and that the Breda 20s claimed by the RAF were in fact Fiat BR.20s. Cullen claimed another multiple kill on 3March, when he and one of <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> chased a group of CANT Z.1007bis that had just bombed Larissa, Greece. Catching the retreating bombers south-west of Corfu, No.80 Squadron claimed six destroyed and one probable. Cullen was credited with destroying four CANTs and probably destroying another, though the Italians reported that only two CANT bombers were lost.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with <b>his</b> <b>comrades.</b> Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
5|$|However, many of <b>his</b> <b>comrades</b> were re-enlisting {{for service}} in the Philippine–American War and in June 1899 Krueger re-enlisted as a private in M Company of the 12th Infantry. Soon {{he was on his}} way to fight Emilio Aguinaldo's Insurrectos as part of Major General Arthur MacArthur, Jr.'s 2nd Infantry Division. He took part in the advance from Angeles City to Tarlac City, Aguinaldo's capital. But Aguinaldo had fled, and the 12th Infantry pursued him vainly all the way through Luzon's central plain to Dagupan City. While serving in an {{infantry}} unit in the Philippines, he was promoted to sergeant. On 1 July 1901, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and posted to the 30th Infantry on Marinduque.|$|E
