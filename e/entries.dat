We distinguish four scenarios: inevitable <b>entry,</b> <b>entry</b> deterrence, <b>entry</b> blockade, and non-credible <b>entry</b> threat. The <b>entry</b> threat stimulates the incumbent to innovate in case <b>entry</b> prevention is possible, but discourages R&D if <b>entry</b> is inevitable. In the case of <b>entry</b> deterrence the incumbent successfully prevents <b>entry</b> by innovating.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 15 Excess <b>entry</b> theorem, {{which shows}} that the free market can {{generate}} too many firms, is a theoretic base for <b>entry</b> regulation. When the current market is a monopoly, <b>entry</b> is considered as excessive if the social welfare under the post-entry Cournot-Nash equilibrium, net of <b>entry</b> coast, is lower than that under monopoly. However, this paper argues that, even if this is true, limiting <b>entry</b> is not an optimal choice of the benevolent government. The entrant has an incentive to produce more than the Cournot-Nash equilibrium output level to get an <b>entry</b> permission {{as long as it}} is still profitable to enter. Therefore, an <b>entry</b> regulation which imposes <b>entry</b> condition, rather than just limiting <b>entry,</b> that the new entrant produces enough to make <b>entry</b> welfare increasing, will be an optimal regulation against excess <b>entry</b> problem. Limiting <b>entry</b> based on the excess <b>entry</b> theorem is a wrong policy, since it ignores the strategic reaction by the new entrant. <b>Entry</b> regulation can cure excess <b>entry</b> problem not by limiting <b>entry</b> but by imposing conditions on <b>entry,</b> since the latter is equivalent to a price regulation on the imperfect post-entry oligopoly market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} pre-bid R&D and auctions design {{literature}} {{to an independent}} private value setting where each bidder incurs a private-information valuation discovery cost upon <b>entry.</b> The seller commits to a mechanism before the bidders' <b>entry</b> decisions. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, a second-price auction with no <b>entry</b> fee and a reserve price equal to seller's valuation is ex ante efficient. Secondly, a second price auction with the same reserve price and appropriate ex ante <b>entry</b> fees is revenue-maximizing. Every bidder's ex ante <b>entry</b> fee equals the hazard rate of his <b>entry</b> cost distribution, evaluated at the desired entry-threshold for him. Thirdly, the revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> differs from the ex ante efficient <b>entry.</b> Fourthly, even for the symmetric setting, the ex ante efficient/revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> could be asymmetric. Lastly, for the symmetric setting, when the cumulative distribution function of the <b>entry</b> costs changes rather slowly with respect to its argument, the efficient <b>entry</b> must be symmetric across bidders {{and it is the}} unique <b>entry</b> equilibrium of the efficient auction. If the hazard rate of the <b>entry</b> cost distribution is additionally increasing, then the revenue-maximizing <b>entry</b> must also be symmetric and it is the unique <b>entry</b> equilibrium of the revenue-maximizing auction. These results mean that large dispersion in the <b>entry</b> costs restores the symmetry in the efficient/revenue-maximizing <b>entry.</b> ...|$|R
