When there is a more severe upper lid retraction or exposure keratitis, marginal myotomy of levator palpebrae associated with lateral tarsal canthoplasty is recommended. This procedure can lower the upper eyelid by as much as 8 mm.

Primary <b>debulking</b> was performed in group 1 (89) patients and interval <b>debulking</b> was performed in group 2 (74) patients. Cytoreductive outcome, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and post-operative complications were analysed. RESULTS: Despite differences in baseline mean age (p= 0. 015), in FIGO stage III/IV (p= 0. 036) and in mean largest diameter of metastatic disease {{at the beginning of}} <b>debulking</b> surgery (p= 0. 037), the optimal <b>debulking</b> rates (residual tumour less than 1 cm) were similar (p= 0. 065). Excision of diaphragmatic metastases was most frequently performed in group 1 (77. 53 %) and coagulation was most frequently performed in group 2 (58. 10 %). Similar overall survival and disease-free survival rates were found. After the propensity matching procedure, the largest diameter of metastatic disease at the time of <b>debulking</b> and no residual tumour (complete <b>debulking)</b> were demonstrated as independent prognostic factors for OS. Plaque-like lesions on the diaphragm metastases were significantly (p= 0. 015) more associated with diaphragm recurrence than papillary lesions. Minor and major complications related to diaphragmatic surgery as well as mean operating time, post-operative care in intensive care unit and length of hospitalisation were significantly higher in group 1 rather than in group 2 (p= 0. 043).

We compared overall survival following surgery in patients undergoing <b>debulking</b> surgery and patients undergoing surgical biopsy for unresectable thymoma. Meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method, and potential publication bias was evaluated with a funnel plot of precision. No randomized trials on this topic were identified. Thirteen retrospective observational studies containing a sum of 314 patients with information on the number of deaths and person-years were suitable for analysis. Information on Masaoka stages, World Health Organization histology and indications for <b>debulking</b> surgery versus surgical biopsy was lacking in most studies. Diversity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments was noted among the eligible studies. One hundred and seventy-two (54. 8 %) patients underwent <b>debulking</b> surgery and 142 (45. 2 %) underwent surgical biopsy. The pooled hazard ratio was 0. 451 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 336 - 0. 605, P < 0. 001), favouring patients undergoing <b>debulking</b> surgery compared with patients undergoing surgical biopsy. The funnel plot of precision demonstrated no important publication bias. Our results suggest that <b>debulking</b> surgery for unresectable thymoma may be associated with improved overall survival and be considered for patients with unresectable thymoma...|$|R
