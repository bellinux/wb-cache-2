50|$|The diode-wired MOSFET {{version of}} the Dickson {{multiplier}} does not work very well at very low voltages {{because of the large}} drain-source volt drops of the MOSFETs. Frequently, a more complex circuit is used to overcome this problem. One solution is to connect in parallel with the switching MOSFET another MOSFET biased into its linear region. This second MOSFET has a lower <b>drain-source</b> <b>voltage</b> than the switching MOSFET would have on its own (because the switching MOSFET is driven hard on) and consequently the output voltage is increased. The gate of the linear biased MOSFET is connected to the output of the next stage so that it is turned off while the next stage is charging from the previous stage's capacitor. That is, the linear-biased transistor is turned off {{at the same time as}} the switching transistor.|$|E
