50|$|The {{departure}} of the Boers and later removal of the remaining garrison in 1906 (with the disbandment of the St Helena Volunteers, {{this was the first}} time the island was left without a garrison) both impacted on the island economy, which was only slightly offset by growing philatelic sales. The successful reestablishment of the flax industry in 1907 did much to counter these problems, generating considerable income during the war years. Lace making was encouraged as an island-industry during the pre-war period, initiated by Emily Jackson in 1890 and a lace-making school was opened in 1908. Two men, known as the Prosperous Bay Murderers, were hanged in 1905. A fish-canning factory opened in 1909 but failed due to an unusual shortage of fish that year. S.S. Papanui, en route from Britain to Australia with emigrants, arrived in James Bay in 1911 on fire, possibly due to spontaneous combustion of coal stored in a thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>hold.</b> The ship burned out and sank, but its 364 passengers and crew were rescued and looked after on the island. A census in 1911 showed the population had fallen from its peak in 1901 to only 3,520 inhabitants. Some 4,800 rats tails were presented to the Government in 1913, who paid a penny per tail.|$|E

The individuals involved in construction will be trained on the proper safety precautions before construction begins. Warning labels concerning the temperature of the unit will be printed on the solar brine concentrator. Regular and preventative maintenance will be performed by a trained individual(s) to keep the unit running safely and efficiently. 	The public involvement plan is crucial to the success of the solar brine concentrator in Alamogordo, New Mexico; this technology would be competing with the cityâ€™s current technology. Meetings will be held to inform the community of the benefits and disadvantages of both technologies. These meetings will help educate the community and address any community concerns. A training session will be held concerning operation, maintenance, and safety precautions of the facility. 	The H 2 OGS full scale unit will produce 25 L/day/person (1 / 2 of the UN minimum per day) for a community of 500 people or 12, 500 L/day (3, 300 gpd, 1. 2 million gpy). The installed cost of the unit is $ 100, 000. With capital cost amortized over 10 years the yearly capital charge is $ 10, 000. With community volunteer labor the operating costs are $ 10, 000 /yr. With 15, 600 L/day of brine feed the produced salts will be 198 lb/day (66, 000 lb/yr). At a salt netback price of $ 0. 33 /lb, the benefits of salt sales are $ 21, 780 /yr. The salt sales will thus cover both capital charges and operating costs, assuming volunteer labor. This optimistic scenario will produce water at zero cost to the community. The current Alamogordo water cost for large volume users is $ 7. 91 /k gal 23. With operating labor included at $ 50, 000 /yr the cost of water will increase to $ 40. 01 /k gal. 	The following report provides a detailed proposal of the solar brine concentrator, including design concepts, experimental results, health safety and environmental concerns, and a public involvement plan.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to analyse {{problems}} with cold when working in dairyfarms with respect to prevalence, frequency and risk for injuries and to propose measures for improvements of thermal conditions. The project comprised two parts: a field study and a questionnaire survey. The field studies were performed at seven dairy-farms in the Uppsala region and six dairy-farms in the northern region of Sweden (Västerbotten). Four of the farms in the Uppsala region were non-insulated loose housing barns, one was an insulated loose housing barn and two had traditional barns with tie stall. In Västerbotten, five of the farms were non-insulated loose housing barns and one was an insulated loose housing barn. In total, 20 farmers were studied during milking and animal feeding and maintenance. The majority of the studied farmers were owners of the farm and family members. During the field study, both physiological and physical measurements were performed. In addition, a detailed observation of the work, which enabled linking of measured data and the work tasks that were carried out. The physiological measurements included skin temperature of different body parts and heart rate. All subjects and their clothes were weighed before and after work in order to estimate sweating and evaporation. Further, the energetic workload was measured at the farms in Västerbotten. The physical measurements concerned air and surface temperature and air velocity in the buildings where work was performed as well as outdoors. A questionnaire was sent to 140 dairy-farms {{in the northern part of}} Sweden. The questions concerned problems and discomfort that may be related to cold, for example, how cold affected the work, problems with clothing, gloves and footwear. As was expected, the study showed that cold might cause considerable stress for dairy-farmers during cold weather. However, problems with cold should be viewed in a larger context. Workers in dairy-farms are exposed to several physical and physiological stressors in the work environment, such as moisture, organic dust, musculoskeletal stress and mental stress. During winter, cold adds to these stressors, which increases the environmental load on the individual. The typical climate in the raised milking parlours was as follows: low air temperature, which was lowest at foot level, high humidity, moisture, frequent draught and low surface temperatures. Hands and fingers often became cold during milking. The hands were often 20 - 25 °C. Especially the finger temperatures dropped to low levels during milking. In many cases it was below 16 °C for almost the whole spell of work. Finger temperatures down to 6 °C were observed at the end of the milking period in milking parlours with a non-insulated holding area, and 9 °C in milking parlours with an <b>insulated</b> <b>holding</b> area. In many cases, foot and toe temperatures dropped to unacceptably low levels. The reasons for cold feet were reported to be the result of inadequate footwear. This problem was probably related to the fact that rubber boots without an insulation layer were very common among the farmers. The second most common problem was sweaty or wet feet. An important way to be protected from cold is to use adequate clothing. Cotton, which absorbs moisture and water well, was a very common material in the garments worn by the farmers. For the outer layer of the clothing, a water-repellent material is a better alternative in cold-wet environments. At heavy work, which results in sweating, cotton is not the most appropriate material to wear close to the skin. Sweat is absorbed by the cotton and thus stays at the skin. This leads to discomfort and feels cold when heavy work changes to light work, or when the worker moves outdoors. Many commercial non-absorbing materials, which may contribute to better thermal comfort, are available. When using underwear made of such materials, the moisture is transported away from the skin to other clothing layers. Both the survey results and the observations indicated that cold was experienced as a minor problem in farms with non-insulated loose housing barns even though most of the participating farms were situated in one of the coldest regions of Sweden. In non-insulated loose housing barns, the work and the protection from cold is most likely adjusted to the cold climate, and temperature changes may lead to less discomfort, at least, for that reason. Greater experience of work in cold conditions probably contributes to a work organisation that minimises cold problems. In traditional barns, temperature changes between buildings and outdoors are common and were considered a major cause for thermal discomfort. Based on the results from this study, recommendations have been worked out. They provide a long list of interventions to prevent cold hands and feet, advice about clothing and other measures for improvements of the thermal conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) is {{the first}} {{experiment}} designed to create and study small Debye length non-neutral plasmas confined by magnetic surfaces. This thesis describes experimental confinement studies of non-neutral plasmas on magnetic surfaces in CNT. Open orbits exist in CNT resulting in electron loss rates that are much faster than initially predicted. For this reason a conforming boundary was designed and installed to address what {{is believed to be}} the primary cause of open orbits: the existence of a sizable mismatch between the electrostatic potential surfaces and the magnetic surfaces. After installation a record confinement time of 337 ms was measured, more than an order of magnitude improvement over the previous 20 ms record. This improvement was a combination of the predicted improvement in orbit quality, a reduced Debye length that resulted in decreased transport due to the perturbing insulated rods, and improved operating parameters not indicative of any new physics. The perturbation caused by the <b>insulated</b> rods that <b>hold</b> emitters on axis in CNT is a source of electron transport and would provide a loss mechanism for positrons in future positron-electron plasma experiments. For these reasons an emitter capable of creating plasmas then being removed faster than the confinement time was built and installed. Measurements of plasma decay after emitter retraction indicate that ion accumulation reduces the length of time that plasmas are confined. Plasmas have been measured after retraction with decay times as long as 92 ms after the emitter has left the last closed flux surface. Experimental observations show that obstructing one side of an emitting filament with a nearby insulator substantially improves confinement. As a result, experiments have been performed to determine whether a two stream instability affects confinement in CNT. Results indicate that the improvement is not caused by reducing a two stream instability. Instead, the improvement is a result of altering the sheath of the emitting filament which allows the plasma to reach an equilibrium state with improved confinement. These measurements agree with confinement times for plasmas created by unobstructed emission that are in the same improved confinement state...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} (HP) sterilization of {{low acid}} foods {{is a process}} involving HP at elevated temperatures. Data available on HP destruction kinetics of pressure resistant pathogenic, spoilage-causing and surrogate bacterial spores are limited, but essential for establishing such a process. While compression heating could be employed to provide the elevated temperature, accurate data gathering under such conditions is difficult due to rapid heat loss during the treatment. The objectives of this research were to first standardize the set up carrying out HP tests at elevated and stabilized temperatures, and subsequently to evaluate HP destruction kinetics of selected bacterial spores under HP elevated temperature processing conditions. The set-up consisted of a thick <b>insulated</b> chamber for <b>holding</b> samples during the test. A relationship was established for the adiabatic temperature rise milk which {{was used as the}} main low acid food medium: DeltaTP = - 0. 306 + 0. 0224 Ti + 0. 0423 P + 4. 49 x 10 - 4 T i 2 + 1. 31 x 10 - 4 TiP [...] 1. 24 x 10 - 5 P 2 (R 2 = 0. 999, n = 50, SE = 0. 20 °C, p HO 9504 A > CK 2 -A). HP destruction kinetics of C. botulinum PA 9508 B spores in milk were evaluated in detail at 700 - 900 MPa at 90 - 100 °C and parallel thermal treatment at 90 - 100 °C. The survival counts were again described by first order linear models (R 2 > 0. 86). The D values varied from 0. 35 min at 900 MPa 110 °C to 38. 9 min at 700 MPa 90 °C for HP treatments and 14. 4 to 273 min at 90 - 100 °C for thermal treatments. These demonstrated that HP processing combined with elevated temperatures will accelerate the spore destruction rate. However, the associated D values of C. botulinum PA 9508 B spores in milk were more resistant than those of C. sporogenes 7955 at 90, 100 °C, which indicated that the surrogate may not be very effective for using as a target for verification HP at elevated temperature processing conditions. Overall, this work has demonstrated several findings. The non-pathogenic C. sporogenes 7955 spore was the most resistant surrogate but the pathogenic C. botulinum PA 9508 B spore was even more resistant. D values associated with HP at elevated temperatures were higher than under conventional thermal treatments, and hence provide accelerated destruction kinetics at least for the non-pathogenic spores and hence better spoilage control. However, from safety point of view the conventional thermal sterility requirements would still persist even under HP processing conditions. Milk as a low acid food medium provided more resistance for HP destruction than fish...|$|R
