40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the debate surrounding}} the trend of global movements away from prohibition and towards a <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> approach to drug policy. This paper reviews the prohibitionist model that is, by and large, the global status quo of how countries deal with drugs. Under the prohibitionist approach, governments criminally ban the production, trafficking, sale, possession, and use of drugs {{in an effort to}} directly combat the harms associated with drugs. Section I of this paper presents the prohibitionist approach as the international status quo and {{examines the}} effects and failures of that approach. Section II examines a variety of <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> approaches that attempt to address harms to drug users and society at large through treatment, tolerance, and the recognition of human rights. However, the potential successes of <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> models are still constrained by the reality of prohibitionist legal regimes whose stricter criminalization of drugs often contradict and frustrate the policies and legislative efforts of <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> proponents. Because the <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> approaches are restrained by a prohibitionist legal regime that criminalizes their policies, legalization becomes a necessary step to achieving the goals of <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> approaches. Therefore, section III of this paper presents an alternative to legal systems that ban drugs in order to remove this clash between prohibitionist and <b>harms</b> <b>reduction</b> policies. Section III lays out three arguments for the legalization of drugs on a global scale. This paper concludes that a legalization-based approach is the best drug policy. It advocates that governing bodies all over the world adopt an intelligent, legalized approach to the problem of drugs in society as a more effective approach to combating the harms of drug addiction and the crimes of the drug trade while upholding human rights, global equity, and rule of law.

40|$|Background Estimating harm {{rates for}} {{specific}} patient populations and detecting {{significant changes in}} them over time are essential if patient safety in general practice is to be improved. Clinical record review (CRR) {{is arguably the most}} suitable method for these purposes, but the optimal values and combinations of its parameters (such as numbers of records and practices) remain unknown. Our aims were to: 1. Determine and quantify CRR parameters; 2. Assess the precision and power of feasible CRR scenarios; and 3. Quantify the minimum requirements for adequate precision and acceptable power. Method We explored precision and power of CRR scenarios using Monte Carlo simulation. A range of parameter values were combined in 864 different CRR scenarios, 1000 random data sets were generated for each, and harm rates were estimated and tested for change over time by fitting a generalised linear model with a Poisson response. Results CRR scenarios with ≥ 100 detected harm incidents had harm rate estimates with acceptable precision. <b>Harm</b> <b>reductions</b> of 20...|$|R

30|$|Addiction {{is not a}} {{diagnostic}} term in ICD- 10, 3 but continues to be very widely employed. It will be restored in DSM-V [10], and maybe also in ICD- 11. However, the expert panel commented that addiction presents itself as a primitive concept in scientific terms, i.e. it has low concept validity. Besides being neither a specific diagnosis nor a very strict concept for scientific purposes, it bears different connotations when applied by domain experts or by the layman. The experts engaged into broad discussions {{about the need for}} a more exact, measureable, comprehensive and consensus based concept applicable for the understanding of addiction in a multi-disciplinary approach such as the ALICE RAP. When discussing a broad range of addictions (e.g. gaming and gambling, social media, physical exercise, sugar urges, eating disorders, etc.), sub-concepts and synonyms of addiction stemming both from the field of practice, the public debate and the sciences, like compulsion, craving, dependency, urge, devotion, dedication, sensation seeking, etc. were introduced. Likewise, the WHO definition does not entail the leisure part of addiction, i.e. addiction as a means of pleasure. For ALICE RAP, it is imperative to develop and apply a conception of the addiction phenomenon that also includes the motives for entering into an addictive mode of behaviour, not only focusing upon <b>harms</b> <b>reduction.</b> Perceptions of addictions, behavioural patterns and interaction contexts in which they occur, and even the experience of addiction itself, are affected by how the phenomenon is conceived [11, 12]. This may in turn colour the concept and the perceptions of addiction and lifestyles as a social trend and assumedly also impact the policy strategies developed to cope with them. The experts took this inadequacy and ambiguity of the addiction concept into consideration when carrying out their discussions and subsequent foresight assignments.|$|R

Compared to risk-based strategies, the uniform ones result in a much lower benefit for a specific cost. Reductions close to 10 % in costs and higher than 20 % in false-positive results and overdiagnosed cases were obtained for risk-based strategies. Optimal screening is characterized by quinquennial or triennial periodicities for the low or moderate risk-groups and annual periodicity for the high-risk group. Risk-based strategies can reduce harm and costs. It is necessary to develop accurate measures of individual risk and to work on how to implement risk-based screening strategies.

30|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{indicated}} some variety {{in the nature of}} gambling consequences for Aboriginal people in Australia. However no previous in-depth investigation across the state of NSW with Aboriginal community leaders has revealed {{the nature and extent of}} gambling impacts on their communities as revealed here. Like many others, Aboriginal communities experience positive and negative impacts of gambling. However, our findings show that, being a culturally collective society and a disadvantaged one as well negative gambling impacts appear to lead to increasing community deprivation and to diminishing respect for meeting cultural obligations. The possibility of reducing community strength and the forfeiture of cultural knowledge linked to gambling losses, all new findings, threaten community well-being and have potentially damaging long-term cultural effects. Traditional Aboriginal priority for community and family values may be overturned if individual rights to gamble take precedence. These findings support ideas by Raylu and Oei (2004) that gambling by certain cultural groups has different meanings and impacts compared with Western-based populations. They also provide evidence for Reith’s (2006) ideas about the intensity of <b>harm</b> and <b>reduction</b> in well-being by disadvantaged groups who gamble.|$|R
25|$|In the {{province}} of North-Brabant {{in the south of}} the Netherlands, the organized crime organizations form the main producer of MDMA, amphetamine and cannabis in Europe. Together with the proximity of the ports of Antwerp and especially Rotterdam where heroin and cocaine enter the European continent, this causes these substances to be readily available for a relative low price. Therefore, there is a large quantity drugs of a relative high quality with few pollution available. This means that users will not have to rely on more polluted substances with greater health risks. Together with an approach that focuses on easily accessible health care, <b>harm</b> <b>reduction</b> and prevention, this causes the medical condition of the Dutch addicts to be less severe than that of many other countries.|$|E

Using experimentally determined biological weighting functions for UV-induced mortality along with measurement-based models of solar irradiance and of vertical distributions of embryos as influenced by mixing, we modeled UVR-induced mortality in the early life stages of two key species in the upper estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus.
