As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he <b>finally</b> <b>has</b> time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks.

In a review of the book for The New York Times Book Review, Zane Berzins was critical of the work, commenting: [...] "There isn't much to be said for the book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination." [...] A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review characterizes it as, [...] "Not a book, really. A verbatim transcription of one of Werner Erhard's weekend sessions in $250 doublethink." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticizes the author for not engaging in any judgmental analysis of the est training methodology. The review concludes, [...] "at least the reader <b>finally</b> <b>has</b> an opportunity to see what an estian seminar is, with vomit bags, circuitous logic, pathetic interplay between overbearing trainer and angst-ridden trainee, and all." ...|$|E

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90 percent based on 10 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 7.1 out of 10. A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a [...] "a straight victory for gay comedy": [...] "India's convoluted attitude to gayness <b>finally</b> <b>has</b> its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which almost no one is actually gay. It's also a terrific movie – the best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen {{in a very long}} time." [...] Describing the film as a [...] "decent-hearted comedy", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Dostana deserves credit. It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood’s best not-so-secret weapon: star power." [...] David Chute of LA Weekly called it [...] "a pure star vehicle, gliding along on charm and timing – exactly the sort of comfort cinema Hollywood now seems incapable of making." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph".

He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant <b>finally</b> <b>has</b> a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E
