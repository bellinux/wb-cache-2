30|$|Between June 2013 and April 2014, {{a single}} surgeon (BJ) {{performed}} 15 total laparoscopic hysterectomies by SILS. All patients {{were selected for}} TLH because of benign or premalignant <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>disease.</b> The following patient and perioperative data were collected and retrospectively analysed: patient age, body mass index (BMI), general health status, total operating time, serum haemoglobin (Hb) drop (change between the preoperative Hb and postoperative Hb 1  day after surgery), (peri-)operative complications, postoperative pain score, and weight of the removed uterus.|$|E
30|$|A recent Cochrane {{review of}} 27 {{randomised}} controlled trials with 3, 643 patients [1] comparing different techniques of hysterectomy in benign <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>disease</b> {{has shown that}} patients undergoing laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) or total laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) have significantly lower mean blood loss (smaller drop in haemoglobin), significantly less infections and a faster return to normal activities when compared to laparotomy. On the other hand, abdominal hysterectomy (AH) requires a significantly lower operating time, {{and the frequency of}} urinary tract injuries is significantly increased for LH or LAVH [1]. The laparoscopic technique had no advantage over vaginal hysterectomy (VH) since in all but two studies LAVH was performed. In this situation, the most important steps of the operation are identical with VH.|$|E

40|$|Endometriosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>diseases</b> in women of {{reproductive}} age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The women affected suffer from pelvic pain and infertility. The complex etiology is still unclear and it is based on three main theories: retrograde menstruation, coelomic metaplasia, and induction theory. Genetics and epigenetics also play a role in the development of endometriosis. Recent studies have put the attention on the role of oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, which may be implicated in the pathophysiology of endometriosis causing a general inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity. Reactive oxygen species are intermediaries produced by normal oxygen metabolism and are inflammatory mediators known to modulate cell proliferation and to have deleterious effects. A systematic review was performed in order to clarify the different roles of oxidative stress and its role in the development of endometriosis. Several issues have been investigated: iron metabolism, oxidative stress markers (in the serum, peritoneal fluid, follicular fluid, peritoneal environment, ovarian cortex, and eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue), genes involved in oxidative stress, endometriosis-associated infertility, and cancer development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBullet wood tree, {{also called}} Spanish cherry (Mimusops elengi L.) is a {{medium-sized}} evergreen tree belonging to family Sapotaceae which {{is widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} different ailments. The present study investigated cytotoxic potential of methanolic leaf and bark extracts against human cervical cancer cell line (SiHa) by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2; 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, the apoptotic cells were quantified further by flow cytometry by FACS fluorescence activated cell sorting. The extract of M. elengi bark and leaf was effective towards tested cell line, with IC 50 values of 35. 08 ± 2. 92 μg/ml and 67. 46 ± 4. 21 μg/ml respectively. Further there is an increase in apoptotic bodies from 0. 24 % to 60 % and 69 % after treatment with extracts. These extracts exhibit significant cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptosis. The M. elengi has never shown anticancer activity on SiHa cells. These findings suggested that extracts and compounds from this plant could be useful for preventing and treating human <b>gynaecologic</b> cancer <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Endometriosis is {{a benign}} <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>disease</b> that is {{associated}} with a certain risk for malignant degeneration. The disease has a genetic background, but the locations of possible genomic aberrations are still poorly clarified. In this context, the proline form of TP 53 codon 72 polymorphism has been recently associated with the risk of developing endometriosis. In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate further the potential association between endometriosis and this polymorphism in order to evaluate whether this genetic variant may influence the susceptibility to the disease. Genomic DNA was obtained from a con-secutive series of 303 Italian Caucasian women of reproductive age who underwent laparoscopy for benign gynaecological pathologies. Endometriosis was defined according to the criteria of Holt and Weiss [Holt V and Weiss NS (2000) Recommen-dations for the design of epidemiologic studies of endometriosis. Epidemiol 11, 654 – 659] for the definite disease. Subjects of similar age without laparoscopic evidence of the disease served as control group. Molecular analysis of TP 53 codon 72 poly-morphism was performed by PCR amplification. Endometriosis was documented in 151 women. We found no statistically significant difference in the distribution of TP 53 codon 72 polymorphism genotypes between patients with and without endome-triosis. The respective proportions of arginine homozygotes, heterozygotes and proline homozygotes were 55. 6, 39. 7 and 4. 6 % in the group with endometriosis and 59. 9, 30. 9 and 9. 2 % in the control group. Moreover, no statistically significant association was demonstrated between TP 53 codon 72 polymorphism and the various clinical manifestations of the disease, although a non-significant tendency towards an increased frequency of the proline allele was observed in association with specific manifes...|$|E
40|$|Serological {{screening}} of recombinant cDNA expression libraries {{has been widely}} used for the identification of tumour antigens in various cancer types. Identification of tumour antigens in ovarian cancer may facilitate the development of vaccine-based therapies and of disease biomarkers. The purpose of our investigation is to identify tumour antigens in ovarian cancer by using the serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries method. A recombinant ovarian carcinoma cDNA expression library was screened with ascites fluid, pooled from five ovarian cancer patients. Twelve tumour antigens encoded by known genes were isolated, including ribosomal protein S 18, heat shock protein 90, JK-recombination signal binding protein, ribonucleoprotein H 1, RAN binding protein 7, TG-interacting factor, eukaryotic translation initiation factor p 40 subunit, human amyloid precursor protein-binding protein 1, ribosomal protein L 8, CDC 23, IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1, and ribosomal protein L 3. Heat shock protein 90 was chosen for further investigation. The prevalence of hsp 90 autoantibodies in ovarian cancer was determined with immunoassay. Sera from 22 normal females, 32 from ovarian cancer (22 stage III/IV, 10 stage I/II), 37 colorectal cancer, 13 breast cancer, 10 lung cancer, 20 benign gynaecologic diseases, and 10 benign breast lesions were screened. Seven (32 %) stage III/IV ovarian cancer, 1 (10 %) stage I/II ovarian cancer, 1 (3 %) colorectal cancer, 1 (8 %) breast cancer, and 1 (5 %) benign <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>disease</b> sera were found to contain hsp 90 autoantibodies. These data {{support the view that}} hsp 90 autoantibodies are frequently found in late stage ovarian cancer. Hsp 90 may, therefore, represent a novel biomarker for ovarian cancer and a candidate ovarian cancer vaccine target...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Endometriosis is a benign, chronic, estrogen-dependent <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>disease</b> {{affecting}} {{millions of}} women of reproductive age. Most of the patients suffer from cycle-dependent symptoms, such as dysmenorrhoea and pelvic pain, whereby 50 % of them require long-term treatment including recurring surgery and/or continuous hormonal treatment. Developing suitable healing options will not be feasible {{as long as the}} pathogenesis of endometriosis, especially the pathogenesis of pain generation, is not fully understood. In this perspective the smooth muscle cells in endometriotic lesions have become a promising research area. Smooth muscle cells are common components of endometriotic lesions and have been characterizied previously in peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions. To date, the origin of these endometriosis-associated smooth muscle cells is still unclear. However, {{there is some evidence that}} they are of metaplastic origin. Furthermore, their biological functionality is still not fully known. Therefore, this retrospective study aims for investigating the differentiation level among endometriosis-associated smooth muscle cells in peritoneal endometriotic lesions. Methods: Biopsies from peritoneal endometriotic lesions (n = 60) and healthy peritoneum from patients without endometriosis (control tissue, n = 10) were obtained. The controls were hysterectomy specimens from patients without endometriosis or adenomyosis. An immunhistochemical examination of peritoneal specimens using antibodies against oxytocin receptor (OTR), vasopressin receptor (VPR) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (sm-MHC) was performed during this study. To identify smooth muscle cells and their level of differentiation, antibodies for smooth muscle actin (smActin), desmin (Des) and caldesmon (Cal) were used. Results: Smooth muscle cells were detected in all endometriotic lesions. They were more abundant in the peritoneum of women with endometriosis (38 %) compared with women without endometriosis (6 %; p < 0, 001). Endometriosis-associated smooth muscle cells were differentiated based on their association with the endometriotic lesion. Intrastromal smooth muscle cells, stroma surrounding smooth muscle cells and peripheral smooth muscle cells could be distinguished. The peripheral smooth muscle cells contained an increased number of differentiated cells compared with intrastromal and stroma surrounding smooth muscle cells (p < 0, 001). Depending on the level of differentiation, smooth muscle cells stained for sm-MHC, OTR and VPR. OTR and VPR were only detected in fully differentiated smooth muscle cells. Conclusions: The present study provides first evidence for a possible metaplastic origin of endometriosis-associated smooth muscle cells. The identification of OTR and VPR leads to the hypothesis that endometriosis-associated smooth muscle cells might be functionally active and possibly involved in the generation of pain associated with endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|I {{have chosen}} the topic ?Knowledge of non-professional public {{in the field of}} {{reproductive}} health? for my bachelor thesis because I am thoroughly interested in this field, and that I find it an increasingly topical question. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with anatomy of reproductive organs, infertility issues, irregularities and pathologies in pregnancy, sexually transmitted <b>diseases,</b> inflammatory <b>gynaecologic</b> <b>diseases</b> and other negative influences on reproductive health. The remaining part of the theory is represented by prevention in the field of reproductive health and the role of midwives in this field. Nursing care in this field deals in particular with education, and for this reason, the midwife - educator is also mentioned here. The objective of this bachelor thesis is to find out what level of knowledge the non-professional public have in the field of reproductive health and, further, whether the non-professional public are interested in extending their knowledge in this field. The further, partial objectives were to compare the knowledge between women and men, as well as to find out whether people look after their reproductive health. To compile the practical part of the bachelor thesis I used the method of the quantitative research. The collection of data was conducted by means of questionnaires. The questionnaire was anonymous and consisted of 25 questions, which were closed, semi-closed and open. The research set for the quantitative research was made up of the non-professional public. They were women and men from the Region of South Bohemia in the age category of 18 ? 60 years, with a various level of education. The total set consisted of 95 (100 per cent) respondents. The result of the quantitative research has shown that the knowledge of the non-professional public in the field of reproductive health can be considered satisfactory. The comparison of knowledge in women and men has proved a slightly better knowledge in women. We have further found out that the non-professional public are interested in extending their knowledge in this field. Despite the fact that people possess knowledge in the field of reproductive health, as has been proved by this research, they do not behave in accordance with their knowledge. A number of individuals do not look after their health. Looking for instruments to motivate people to take better care of their health would exceed the scope of this thesis, and thus it remains for further researchers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In the {{management}} of HIV, women and men generally undergo the same treatment pathway, with gender differences being given limited consideration. This is in spite of accumulating evidence {{that there are a}} number of potential differences between women and men which may affect response to treatment, pharmacokinetics, toxicities and coping. There are also notable psychological, behavioural, social and structural factors that may have a unique impact on women living with HIV (WLWH). Despite our increasing knowledge of HIV and advances in treatment, there are significant gaps in the data relating specifically to women. One of the factors contributing to this situation is the under-representation of women in all aspects of HIV clinical research. Furthermore, there are clinical issues unique to women, including <b>gynaecologic</b> and breast <b>diseases,</b> menopause-related factors, contraception and other topics related to women&#x 0027;s and sexual health. Methods: Using scoping review methodology, articles from the literature from 1980 to 2012 were identified using appropriate MeSH headings reflecting the clinical status of WLWH, particularly in the areas of clinical management, sexual health, emotional wellbeing and treatment access. Titles and abstracts were scanned to determine whether they were relevant to non-reproductive health in WLWH, and papers meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed. Results: This review summarizes our current knowledge of the clinical status of WLWH, particularly in the areas of clinical management, sexual health, emotional wellbeing and treatment access. It suggests {{that there are a number}} of gender differences in disease and treatment outcomes, and distinct women-specific issues, such as menopause and co-morbidities, that pose significant challenges to the care of WLWH. Conclusions: Based on a review of this evidence, outstanding questions and areas where further studies are required to determine gender differences in the efficacy and safety of treatment and other clinical and psychological issues specifically affecting WLWH have been identified. Well-controlled and adequately powered clinical studies are essential to help provide answers to these questions and to contribute to activities aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of WLWH...|$|R
