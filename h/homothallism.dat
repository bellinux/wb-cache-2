For example, one subspecies of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Sistotrema brinkmannii is homothallic, although other subspecies have maintained their ability to outcross. Also, a variety of the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus, (A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus) produces haploid self-fertile basidiospores. Additionally, in the human pathogen C. neoformans known to outcross under laboratory conditions, both mating types are not normally distributed in natural populations, with the α mating type much more commonly found (>99%), suggesting <b>homothallism</b> is the most prevalent mode of sexual reproduction in ´C. neoformans in nature.

50|$|Some of {{the species}} within Basidiomycota have the most complex systems of sexual {{reproduction}} known among Fungi. In general for Fungi {{there are two main}} types of sexual reproduction: <b>homothallism,</b> when mating occurs within a single individual, or in other words each individual is self-fertile; and heterothallism, when hyphae from a single individual is self-sterile and needs to interact with another compatible individual for mating to take place. Additionally, mating compatibility in the Basidiomycota is further categorized into two types of mating systems: tetrapolar and bipolar.|$|E
50|$|Fungal species {{within the}} phylum Basidiomycetes, {{including}} mushroom-forming species, experience {{a more complex}} reproductive cycle. They contain the ability to self-fertilize (<b>homothallism)</b> or more commonly require hyphae from two individuals of different mating types to make contact and fertilize (heterothallism). Heterothallic fertilization occurs once two haploid mycelia (homokaryons) of different mating types have made contact. They then exchange nuclei and migrate to form a dikaryotic hyphae (heterokaryon) containing two separate haploid nuclei, one from each parent. The dikaryon then grows and may produce a diploid fruiting body that immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid mycelia which can then be fertilized by another nucleus. The dikaryon can also simultaneously fertilize again by donating a nucleus to another homokaryon.|$|E
50|$|A lichen is a {{composite}} organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner that are growing together in a symbiotic relationship. The photosynthetic partner is usually either a green alga or a cyanobacterium. Lichens occur {{in some of the}} most extreme environments on Earth—arctic tundra, hot deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. Most lichenized fungi produce abundant sexual structures and in many species sexual spores appear to be the only means of dispersal (Murtagh et al., 2000). The lichens Graphis scripta and Ochrolechia parella do not produce symbiotic vegetative propagules. Rather the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are homothallic), and it was proposed that this breeding system allows successful reproduction in harsh environments. (Murtagh et al., 2000).Homothallism appears to be common in natural populations of fungi. Although self-fertilization employs meiosis, it produces minimal genetic variability. <b>Homothallism</b> is thus a form of sex that is unlikely to be adaptively maintained by a benefit related to producing variability. However, homothallic meiosis may be maintained in fungi as an adaptation for surviving stressful conditions; a proposed benefit of meiosis is the promoted homologous meiotic recombinational repair of DNA damages that are ordinarily caused by a stressful environment.|$|E

40|$|Volvariella volvacea is an {{important}} crop in Southeast Asia, but erratic fruiting presents a serious challenge for its production and breeding. Efforts to explain inconsistent fruiting have been complicated by the multinucleate nature, typical lack of clamp connections, and an incompletely identified sexual reproductive system. In this study, we addressed {{the life cycle of}} V. volvacea using whole genome sequencing, cloning of MAT loci, karyotyping of spores, and fruiting assays. Microscopy analysis of spores had previously indicated the possible coexistence of heterothallic and homothallic life cycles. Our analysis of the MAT loci showed that only MAT-A, and not MAT-B, controlled heterokaryotization. Thus, the heterothallic life cycle was bipolar. Karyotyping of single spore isolates (SSIs) using molecular markers supported the existence of heterokaryotic spores. However, most SSIs were clearly not heterokaryotic, yet contained structural variation (SV) markers relating to both alleles of both parents. Heterokaryons from crossed, self-sterile homokaryons could produce fruiting bodies, agreeing with bipolar heterothallism. Meanwhile, some SSIs with two different MAT-A loci also produced fruiting bodies, which supported secondary <b>homothallism.</b> Next, SSIs that clearly contained only one MAT-A locus (<b>homothallism)</b> were also able to fruit, demonstrating that self-fertile SSIs were not, per definition, secondary homothallic, and that a third life cycle or genetic mechanism must exist. Finally, recombination between SV markers was normal, yet 10 out of 24 SV markers showed 1 : 2 or 1 : 3 distributions in the spores, and large numbers of SSIs contained doubled SV markers.

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in fungi {{is controlled}} by genes present at the mating type (MAT) locus, which typically harbors transcription factors that influence the expression of many sex-related genes. The MAT locus exists as two alternative idiomorphs in ascomycetous fungi and sexual reproduction is initiated when genes from both idiomorphs are expressed. Thus, the gene content of this locus determines whether a fungus is heterothallic (self-sterile) or homothallic (self-fertile). Recently, a unique sub-class of <b>homothallism</b> has been described in fungi, where individuals possessing a single MAT idiomorph can reproduce sexually {{in the absence of}} a partner. Using various mycological, molecular and bioinformatic techniques, we investigated the sexual strategies and characterized the MAT loci in two tree wound-infecting fungi, Huntiella moniliformis and Huntiella omanensis. H. omanensis was shown to exhibit a typically heterothallic sexual reproductive cycle, with isolates possessing either the MAT 1 - 1 or MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph. This was in contrast to the <b>homothallism</b> via unisexual reproduction that was shown in H. moniliformis, where only the MAT 1 - 2 - 1 gene was present in sexually reproducing cultures. While the evolutionary benefit and mechanisms underpinning a unisexual mating strategy remain unknown, it could have evolved to minimize the costs, while retaining the benefits, of normal sexual reproduction.

Of the 30 isolates. 4 {{belonged to the}} Al compatibility type, 7 were A 2 and 19 were infertile or AO. Fertility varied among the 11 fertile isolates from highly fertile to very low in fertility. Seven of the 11 isolates produced a few oospores in unpaired (solo) cultures. Although P. capsici has been considered a heterothallic species. oospore distribution patterns in pairings between compatible Al and A 2 isolates suggested mutual induction of oospore formation. Oogonia and oospores which formed near the A 2 colony were smaller than those developing near the Al colony suggesting that the smaller bodies were A 2 products and the Jarger bodies were formed by the Al isolate. This was confirmed in pairings physically separated by polycarbonate membranes. Several oosporogenic pathways in P. capsici were distinguished and five categories were suggested for the genus: (1) <b>homothallism</b> sensu stricto. (2) induced <b>homothallism.</b> (3) noninduced homothallism; (4) secondary <b>homothallism</b> and (5) heterothallism. The optimal temperature for oospore formation in darkness was 20 - 24 C. whereas 31 C was distinctly inhibitory to oospore production. Light inhibition of oospore formation {{was found to be}} temperature dependent. Effect of light over the spectrum from 290 to 750 nm was minimal at 16 C, while at 24 C there was pronounced inhibition at 440 - 470 nm with some inhibition between 500 and 700 nm. Indirect effects of light were discovered in comparisons of several culture media used to study oosporogenesis. Clarified vegetable juice agar, oatmeal agar, and a synthetic medium, inhibited oospore formation when these were exposed to light prior to inoculation with the Al and A 2 compatibility types. Rape-malt agar was not affected by light under the present test conditions. Phytophthora capsici produced abundant oospores when Difco Bacto agar was used as the solidifying agent but oospore production was greatly reduced on Seakem HGT(P) agarose, Difco Noble agar or Difco Purified agar. Chlamydospores were found in 20 of 29 isolates of P. capsici using a submerged culture method. Chlamydospores were not produced in the papaya fruit broth method developed for P. palmivora.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{evolution}} of reproductive systems and reproductive traits in the fungal genus Neurospora. More specifically, I have investigated the evolutionary forces shaping the genes involved in sexual reproduction, focusing on mating-type (mat) and pheromone receptor (pre) genes. Neurospora contains species exhibiting three different mating systems, i. e., heterothallism (self-incompatibility), <b>homothallism</b> (self-compatibility) and pseudohomothallism (partial self-incompatibility). First, a robust phylogeny of Neurospora was established. The phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple independent transitions in reproductive life style during the evolutionary history of the genus. We argued for a heterothallic ancestor of the genus, although our subsequent ancestral reconstruction analyses favored a homothallic ancestor. To be able to settle the ancestral mating system, we zoomed in on the structural architecture of the mat-locus in four homothallic species of Neurospora, thought to have arisen from independent transitions. Our results led us to suggest two different genetic mechanisms (translocation and unequal crossover) to explain the transitions in mating system from heterothallism to <b>homothallism.</b> We {{pointed out that the}} mating-system transitions in Neurospora are unidirectional, and suggested that transposable elements might be driving the transitions. In conclusion, we suggest a heterothallic ancestor for Neurospora, and that at least six transitions to <b>homothallism</b> and two transitions to pseudohomothallism have occurred in its evolutionary history. Further, we used the phylogeny of Neurospora as a framework to test if the evolution of pre-genes (pre- 1 and pre- 2) in hetero- and homothallic Neurospora is dependent on mating systems and/or even the homothallic clades themselves (i. e., mating-system and/or switch-dependent). The molecular evolution results suggest that pre- 1 and pre- 2 are overall functional in both homothallic and heterothallic Neurospora. The molecular evolution of pre- 1 seems to be independent of mating-system or homothallic clade, and we detected signs for positive selection in the C-terminal tail. For pre- 2 we found no support for mating-system dependent evolution, but indications for switch-dependent evolution. In this study we also included expression analyses of both pre- as well as mat-genes, with the prospect to assess functionality and regulation. During this thesis work, we also performed a phylogenetic study were we found that reproductive genes might be more permeable to introgression than other genes, which is in contrast to theoretical expectations. In the last study, we confirmed the co-existence of two alternative splice variants of the pheromone receptor gene pre- 1 in Neurospora crassa, and performed expression profiles studies using quantitative RT-PCR.

40|$|Mating type {{switches}} in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae occur by transposition of {{a replica of}} the 'source; unexpressed loci HML and HMR to the mating type locus (MAT). The incoming information replaces previously expressed DNA, resulting in an interconversion of MAT alleles. A strain of genotype HMLα/HMLα MATα/mata-missense HMRα/hmra-nonsense HO/ho generates cells with the genotype HMLα/HMLαMATα/MATaHMRα/hmra-nonsense HO/ho; that is, wild-type MATa + recombinants are produced efficiently by a strain in which the incoming a information and the resident mata allele bear different mutations. Production of the wild-type MATa recombinants requires the <b>homothallism</b> (switching) function, and the incoming a information and the resident mata allele must bear different mutations. This result is consistent with the formation of a heteroduplex between the incoming and the outgoing DNA at MAT. Thus a process of unidirectional gene conversion as a mechanism for mating type gene transposition is favored. A molecular model based on a single-strand transfer is proposed. Results also favor the idea that the direction of switching is controlled by cell's mating phenotype rather than by the genetic content of MAT...|$|E
40|$|Botryotinia fuckeliana (Botrytis cinerea) is a heterothallic ascomycete which {{produces}} linear 8 -spored asci (tetrads) in apothecia. Ascospores {{were collected in}} their linear sequence from individual asci, and analysed to determine the segregation patterns of alleles at gene loci controlling mating type (MAT 1), resistance to dicarboximide fungicides (Daf 1) and resistance to benzimidazole fungicides (Mbc 1). The alleles were present in their expected linear sequence in 58 % of the asci; most irregular sequences (32 % of the asci) were caused by single exchanges between adjacent spores. The MAT 1 locus was ca 12 map units from its centromere, and the Mbc 1 locus showed loose linkage with its centromere. The Mbc 1 and Daf 1 loci were ca 47 map units apart on the same chromosome and not linked with the MAT 1 locus. Pairs of homothallic ascospores were found in seven out of 105 asci. <b>Homothallism</b> was not caused by inclusion {{of more than one}} nucleus in ascospores, and it occurred only in ascospores predicted to carry the MAT 1 - 2 allele after meiosis...|$|E
40|$|Killer {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are those {{carrying}} a 1. 5 x 10 (6) -dalton double-stranded (ds) ribonucleic acid (RNA) (M) in virus-like particles and secreting a protein toxin. Most yeast (koller or not) also carry a 3 x 10 (6) -dalton dsRNA (L). We have mapped mutations in {{eight of the}} chromosomal genes needed for maintaining M (mak genes). The mak genes are widely distributed on the yeast map, with no multigene complexes. We show that mutants defective in these and other mak genes lose M dsRNA, but not L dsRNA. The mak 3 - 1 mutation results in markedly decreased cellular levels of L dsRNA, but mak 3 - 1 stains do not lose L dsRNA completely. Mutation of mak 16 results in temperature-sensitive growth, whereas mutations in mak 13, mak 15, mak 17, mak 20, mak 22, and mak 27 result in slow growth at any temperature. No effect of mak mutations on mating, meiosis, sporulation, germination, <b>homothallism,</b> or ultraviolet sensitivity has been found. The specificity of mak mutations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tuber spp. are {{filamentous}} ascomycetes which establish symbiosis {{with the}} roots of trees and shrub species. By virtue of this symbiosis they produce hypogeous ascocarps, known as truffles. Filamentous ascomycetes can reproduce by <b>homothallism</b> or heterothallism depending on the structure and organization of their mating type locus. The first mating type locus in a truffle species has been recently characterized in Tuber melanosporum {{and it has been}} shown that this fungus, endemic in Europe, is heterothallic. The availability of sequence information for T. melanosporum mating type genes is seminal to cloning their orthologs from other Tuber species and assessing their reproductive mode. Here we report on the organization of the mating type region in T. indicum, the black truffle species present in Asia, which is the closest relative to T. melanosporum and is characterized by an high level of morphological and genetic variability. The present study shows that T. indicum is also heterothallic. Examination of Asiatic black truffles belonging to different genetic classes, sorted according to the sequence polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA region, has revealed sequence variation...|$|E
40|$|Mating-type {{genes in}} fungi encode {{regulators}} of mating and sexual development. Heterothallic ascomycete species require {{different sets of}} mating-type genes to control nonself-recognition and mating of compatible partners of different mating types. Homothallic (self-fertile) species also carry mating-type genes in their genome that are essential for sexual development. To analyze the molecular basis of <b>homothallism</b> {{and the role of}} mating-type genes during fruiting-body development, we deleted each of the three genes, SmtA- 1 (MAT 1 - 1 - 1), SmtA- 2 (MAT 1 - 1 - 2), and SmtA- 3 (MAT 1 - 1 - 3), contained in the MAT 1 - 1 part of the mating-type locus of the homothallic ascomycete species Sordaria macrospora. Phenotypic analysis of deletion mutants revealed that the PPF domain protein-encoding gene SmtA- 2 is essential for sexual reproduction, whereas the α domain protein-encoding genes SmtA- 1 and SmtA- 3 play no role in fruiting-body development. By means of cross-species microarray analysis using Neurospora crassa oligonucleotide microarrays hybridized with S. macrospora targets and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified genes expressed under the control of SmtA- 1 and SmtA- 2. Both genes are involved in the regulation of gene expression, including that of pheromone genes...|$|E
40|$|In the fungal genus Cordyceps, {{the type}} species C. militaris {{produces}} bioactive ingredients and exhibits medicinal effects as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Currently, the fruiting-body of C. militaris has been artificially mass-produced as functional {{food and medicine}} in China. The unstable variation in forming fruiting-body is however a restriction in the production. The genetic study on perithecial stromata (fruiting-body) formation in vitro of C. militaris {{has not yet been}} reported. In this study, we report the effect of genetic variation including possession of the mating system on perithecial stromata formation of C. militaris. The results showed that the mono-conidial isolates with both MAT 1 - 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 - 1 (genotype MAT 1 - 1 / 2) produced stromata. While the isolates having only either MAT 1 - 1 - 1 or MAT 1 - 2 - 1 failed to produce stromata. Despite obvious heterothallism, <b>homothallism</b> was occasionally observed in a few isolates of C. militaris. Genetic variation was observed amongst the different mono-conidial isolates of C. militaris. The unstable variation or loss of fruiting-body formation was caused by the inner-specific genetic variation...|$|E
40|$|TSF 3 encodes {{one of six}} (TSF 1 to TSF 6) {{recently}} identified global negative regulators of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutant tsf 3 strains exhibit {{defects in}} transcriptional silencing of the GAL 1 promoter, allow expression from upstream activation sequence-less promoters, and exhibit pleiotropic defects in cell growth and development. Here we show that TSF 3 is involved in transcriptional silencing mediated by the alpha 2 repressor and demonstrate that specific systems of transcriptional silencing may depend on the more global role of TSF 3. Cloning and sequencing of TSF 3 allowed us to predict a 974 -amino-acid gene product identical to SIN 4, a negative regulator of transcription of the HO (<b>homothallism)</b> mating type switching endonuclease. TSF 3 disruptions are not lethal but result in phenotypes {{similar to those of}} the originally isolated alleles. Our results, together with those of Y. W. Jiang and D. J. Stillman (Mol. Cell. Biol. 12 : 4503 - 4514, 1992), suggest that TSF 3 (SIN 4) affects the function of the basal transcription apparatus, and this effect in turn alters the manner in which the latter responds to upstream regulatory proteins...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a general new approach for identifying recessive mutations that affect diploid {{strains of yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and the application of}} this method to the identification of mutations that confer an intermediate block in meiotic prophase chromosome metabolism. The method uses a temperature-sensitive conjugation mutation ste 7 - 1 in combination with <b>homothallism.</b> The mutations of interest confer a defect in spore formation that is dependent upon a gene required for initiation of meiotic recombination and development of meiosis-specific chromosome structure (SPO 11). Identified in this screen were null mutations of the DMC 1 gene, nonnull mutations of RAD 50 (rad 50 S), and mutations in three new genes designated SAE 1, SAE 2 and SAE 3 (Sporulation in the Absence of Spo Eleven). Molecular characterization of the SAE 2 gene and characterization of meiotic and mitotic phenotypes of sae 2 mutants are also presented. The phenotypes conferred by a sae 2 null mutation are virtually indistinguishable from those conferred by the previously identified nonnull mutations of RAD 50 (rad 50 S). Most notably, both mutations confer only weak sensitivity to the radiomimetic agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) but completely block resection and turnover of meiosis-specific double-strand breaks. These observations provide further evidence that this constellation of phenotypes identifies a specific molecular function...|$|E
