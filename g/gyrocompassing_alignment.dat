40|$|A {{discontinuity}} {{seems to}} exist in present aided inertial navigation systems – the operational availability of high cost inertial navigation currently depends {{on the availability of}} a valid GPS lock. In general GPS solutions can be two or more orders cheaper than their inertial sensors counterparts. This paper addresses the north alignment by gyrocompassing in the context of more modern smoothing techniques. Incremental smoothing is becoming a serious contender for in-situ state estimation. The work here presents a probabilistic model for north alignment with an analysis towards the achievable accuracy of such a system. A pose graph formulation is used to estimate inertial sensor calibration terms over a long spanning trajectory, from which a true north alignment can be extracted. The preintegral method is used to condense high rate inertial data, but allow for post integration bias correction. Results show that the proposed alignment scheme is feasible, and would for <b>gyrocompassing</b> <b>alignment</b> relaxed sensor performance constraints[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Land combat {{vehicles}} are inevitably {{subject to the}} vibration disturbance by wind gust or engine idling, etc. in the stationary initial alignment process of the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS). Obviously, it’s necessary to consider the impact of vibration disturbance during the alignment process to achieve better performance. In order to guarantee the alignment accuracy on the rocking base and shorten the convergence time of <b>alignment,</b> a <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> method of SINS based on Kalman filter pretreatment and dynamic gain adjustment was proposed. The output of gyros and accelerometers was firstly pre-filtered by Kalman filter to remove the impact of high-frequency small-amplitude rocking interference. The low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference on vehicle was tracked through dynamic gain adjustment of <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment.</b> The vehicle test of a ring laser SINS showed that the new <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> method can suppress high-frequency disturbances when the vehicle underwent low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference. And the alignment process can track the attitude change of vehicle caused by low-frequency large-amplitude rocking interference. Comparing with traditional <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> algorithm and Kalman filter alignment method, {{the performance of the}} new <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> method is much improved by filtering random noise caused by vibration disturbance of vehicle effectively...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the {{nonlinear}} factor caused by large azimuth misalignment, the conventional <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> method is hard to favorably meet the requirement of alignment speed under the condition of large azimuth misalignment of INS. In order to solve this problem, an improved <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> method is presented in this paper. The improved method is designed based on the nonlinear model for large azimuth misalignment and performed by opening the azimuth loop. The influence of the nonlinear factor on <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> will be reduced when opening the azimuth loop. Simulation and experimental results show that the initial alignment can be efficiently accomplished through using the improved method in the case of existing large azimuth misalignment, and in the same conditions, the alignment speed of the improved method is faster than that of the conventional one...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> for strap-down {{inertial navigation system}} (SINS) on moving base assisted with Doppler velocity log (DVL) is proposed in this paper. After analyzing the classical <b>gyrocompass</b> <b>alignment</b> principle on static base, implementation of compass alignment on moving base is given in detail. Furthermore, based on analysis of velocity error, latitude error, and acceleration error on moving base, two improvements are introduced to ensure alignment accuracy and speed: (1) the system parameters are redesigned to decrease the acceleration interference and (2) a data repeated calculation algorithm is used in order to shorten the prolonged alignment time caused by changes in parameters. Simulation and test {{results indicate that the}} improved method can realize the alignment on moving base quickly and effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{precision}} <b>alignment</b> <b>gyrocompass</b> (PAG) system, {{a prototype}} system, was thoroughly evaluated at one laboratory and used {{at a second}} laboratory. A wealth of information describing potential error sources such as draft sensitivity, warm-up time, creep, seismic disturbances, and their circumvention was generated. System repeatability is discussed as it affects operating procedures. Two-position, four-position, and H-modulation gyrocompass techniques were studied, tested, and evaluated. At one location, the PAG absolute system accuracy was checked against a precision astronomically referenced azimuth in a very quiet and stable suburban environment.
