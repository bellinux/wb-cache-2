40|$|<b>Electric</b> strain <b>gages</b> {{have been}} used to obtain average extensional strain over a given gage length since the 1930 s. However, the {{literature}} regarding the inherent uncertainty in a gradient strain measurement is scarce. The resistive gages are produced as flat foils by printed circuit techniques, {{in the form of a}} grid on a plastic backing. The novelty of this research program is to examine the manufacturing of the strain gage by modeling the behavior of the gage. The principal sources of error that influence the measurement of stress concentration factors are studied. Recommendations for manufacturing strain gages for high strain gradient measurements are made...|$|R
40|$|Displacement {{measurement}} methods based on optical image recording and its digital correlation entered their {{industrial application phase}} thanks to the constant computer development. Nowadays, in laboratory conditions especially, they supplant such techniques as moiré method, photo-stress method and <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages</b> in certain examples. Nonetheless, application in the field conditions, such as inflight tests, is still restricted by the operational and accuracy demands. The AIM and AIM 2 consortia have developed one of the methods based on photogrammetry combined with digital image correlation, which was originally invented in DLR and named IPCT, for wing deformation measurements. The aim in this field was to develop IPCT to the TRL 9 for the in-flight test application by industry which was demonstrated by several reference missions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} essentially of {{two distinct}} parts. The first part {{deals with the}} development of the theory and the second part deals with experimental verification of the theory. The theory developed in this paper applies to the analysis of prismatic shells, also called hipped-plate structures or "Faltwerke", and uses only techniques commonly employed in structural engineering analysis. A cylindrical shell is approximated by a prismatic shell and analysed as such. In the analysis, extensive use is made of a relaxation or distribution method. Both simply supported and continuous shells are treated. For the purpose of verifying the theory several test models were built, both prismatic and cylindrical. Stresses were measured with <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages,</b> and close agreement was found between theory and experiments...|$|R
40|$|Flat sheet {{panels of}} {{aluminum}} alloy (all 17 S-T {{except for two}} specimens of 24 S-T) were tested under normal pressures with clamped edge supports in the structures laboratory of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. The thicknesses used ranged from 0. 010 to 0. 080 inch; the panel sizes ranged from 10 by 10 inches to 10 by 40 inches; and the pressure range was from 0 to 60 -pounds-per-square-inch gage. Deflection patterns were measured and maximum tensile strains {{in the center of}} the panel were determined by <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages.</b> The experimental data are presented by pressure-strain, pressure-maximum-deflection, and pressure-deflection curves. The results of these tests have been compared with the corresponding strains and deflections as calculated by the simple membrane theory and by large deflection theories...|$|R

40|$|Since the first-published {{work in the}} 50 's {{the time}} {{dependent}} behaviour raised an increasing interest in wood material research. Creep research has a decisive influence in timber structures where prediction of total deflection is necessary for durable structural design. The nature of polymeric constituents induces viscoelastic behavior to wood. In constant environment the representation of creep against logarithm of time could be composed of two straight-line parts joined by a curved transition [1]. Such a linear description of kinetic suggests an infinite strain level in long-term prediction. However as a semi-crystalline polymer wood is expected to tend toward a limit of creep level. A simplified rheological approach using parabolic models has been proposed by Huet [2] to model timedependent behavior of wood in longitudinal direction. Sorption processes are suspected to accelerate time by increasing compliance [3]. This phenomenon called mechanosorptive effect interacts with ongoing time-dependent evolution and induces a slope decrease after a cycle in the logarithm description [4]. Matched spruce specimens (L= 100 x R= 10 x T= 2 mm) have been submitted to four-point bending creep test (inner span = 40 mm and outer span = 80 mm) in controlled climatic environment. The strain has been measured on lower and upper surface of each specimen using <b>electric</b> <b>gages.</b> Four specimens were loaded at high humidity level (w ! 27 %) below the limit of linearity of viscoelastic and mechanosorptive response [5]. Two specimens were kept unloaded for free swelling and shrinkage determination. Three specimens were weighted occasionally for moisture content determination w. Parabolic models {{have been used to}} estimate creep limit of the viscoelastic description. Submitted to sorption cycles (from w ! 27 % to w ! 7 %) the increase of compliance and the decrease of slope evolution have been observed. Comparison between viscoelastic evolution and mechanosorptive increment during a sorption cycle seems to support the hypothesis that mechanosorptive can induce an apparent time-lag but also a non recoverable strain...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop bending-type piezoelectric ceramic actuators having functionally graded microstructures (FGM). Porosity-graded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics were selected as a model material. Miniature porosity-graded actuator samples with three layers of different porosities (0, 10, 20 %) were fabricated by sintering layer-stacked powder compacts that consist of PZT and pore-forming agent (PFA) powders in air atmosphere, whereby stearic acid was added as a pore-forming agent. In order to fabricate PZT/Metal or PZT/Polymer FGM actuators using porosity-graded PZT ceramics as a preform, another pore-forming agent, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) powder was also used to increase open porosity. The electric-field-induced deflection characteristic of the beam-shaped actuator samples was measured with <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages,</b> and compared with the values calculated from the modified classical laminate theory using the elastic and piezoelectric constants of the non-FGM porous PZT ceramics. It was found that the experimentally measured deflection values of the obtained actuator samples well agreed with the calculated data. An optimum porosity profile that gives the largest deflection was also determined by the modified classical lamination theory...|$|R
40|$|A high {{temperature}} <b>electric</b> resistance strain <b>gage</b> system {{was developed and}} evaluated to 1366 K (2000 F) for periods {{of at least one}} hour. Wire fabricated from a special {{high temperature}} strain gage alloy (BCL- 3), was used to fabricate the gages. Various joining techniques (NASA butt welding, pulse arc, plasma needle arc, and dc parallel gap welding) were investigated for joining gage filaments to each other, gage filaments to lead-tab ribbons, and lead-tab ribbons to lead wires. The effectiveness of a clad-wire concept as a means of minimizing apparent strain of BCL- 3 strain gages was investigated by sputtering platinum coatings of varying thicknesses on wire samples and establishing the optimum coating thickness [...] in terms of minimum resistivity changes with temperature. Finally, the moisture-proofing effectiveness of barrier coatings subjected to elevated temperatures was studied, and one commercial barrier coating (BLH Barrier H Waterproofing) was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The data {{obtained}} {{at the time}} of the Thunderstorm Research International Project storm at the Kennedy Space Center on July 11, 1978 are analyzed in a model-independent manner. The data base included data from three Doppler radars, a lightning detection and ranging system and a network of 25 electric field mills, and rain <b>gages.</b> <b>Electric</b> field measurements were used to analyze the charge moments transferred by lightning flashes, and the data were fitted to Weibull distributions; these were used to estimate statistical parameters of the lightning for both intracloud and cloud-to-ground flashes and to estimate the fraction of the flashes which were below the observation threshold. The displacement and the conduction current densities were calculated from electric field measurements between flashes. These values were used to derive the magnitudes and the locations of dipole and monopole generators by least squares fitting the measured Maxwell current densities to the displacement-dominated equations...|$|R
40|$|Ten 24 S-T alclad {{cylinders}} of 20 -inch diameter, 45 - or 58 -inch length, and 0. 012 -inch wall thickness, {{reinforced with}} 24 S-T aluminum alloy stringers and rings {{were tested in}} pure bending. In {{the middle of the}} compression side of the cylinders there was a cutout extending over 19 inches in the longitudinal direction, and over an angle of 45 degrees, 90 degrees, or 135 degrees in the circumferential direction. The strain in the stringers and in the sheet covering was measured with metal <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages.</b> The stress distribution in the cylinders deviate considerably from the linear law valid for cylinders without a cutout. The maximum strain measured was about four-thirds of the value calculated from the Mc/I formula when I was taken as the moment of inertia of the cross section of the portion of the cylinder where the cutout was situated. A diagram is presented containing the strain factors defined as the ratios of measured strain to strain calculated with the Mc/I formula. All the 10 cylinders tested failed in general instability. Two symmetric and one antisymmetric pattern of buckling were observed and the buckling load appeared to be independent of the method of manufacture and the length of the cylinder. The buckling load of the cylinders having cutouts extending over 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees was 66, 47, and 31 percent, respectively, of the buckling load of the cylinder without a cutout...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{conducted}} with a pierced light-gage, cold-formed steel channel {{were used to}} evaluate four different criteria for experimentally determining the elastic buckling loads of thin plates. The single test specimen was a ten foot length of a 14 -gage section with a nominal 8 " web and nominal 3 " lipped flanges. The section was loaded as a beam bent about its minor axis so that the web was placed in compression. A constant-moment mid-span region of five times the web width simulated a long plate subjected to in-plane compression. Tests of the unpierced specimen were followed by tests in which the specimen had a single hole {{in the center of}} the web. A repetitive process of flanging the plain holes and then cutting off the flanges created a succession of plain and reinforced holes of increasing diameter. A total of thirty-six tests were carried out. The specimen was instrumented with as many as forty <b>electric</b> strain <b>gages</b> and nine dial gages. The four buckling criteria considered were the maximum strain (or strain reversal) criterion, the top-of-the-knee criterion, the inflection point criterion, and the Southwell plot method. The last was judged to be the most accurate and appropriate, and it was applied in studying the effects of the hole on the elastic buckling load. The critical load was found to be insensitive to hole size for both plain and reinforced holes up to a hole diameter of about one-half the plate width. Tests were not conducted for large holes. The addition of a reinforcing lip increased the buckling load by over 50 %. The experimental results agree fairly well with the results of a finite element study...|$|R
