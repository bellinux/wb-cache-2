2500|$|Sometime in {{the course}} of his time in the east, Gaius led an {{expedition}} into Arabia. Exactly where and for what purpose remains uncertain, though Pliny mentioned it in connection with Aelius Gallus' exploits in South Arabia. The term [...] "Arabia" [...] is never defined, and the term was used loosely by Roman sources. Various reasons, such as an attempt by Rome to control the incense trade, have been suggested but never proven. Juba II, former king of Mauretania, accompanied Gaius to the east. In order to prepare Gaius for his encounter with the Arabs, Juba wrote him a treatise. According to Pliny, the young prince made it as far as the Gulf of Aqaba. It is certain that this expedition happened before his time in Armenia, and, referencing Gaius' cenotaph in Pisa, it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> have taken place during his consulship.|$|E

50|$|A {{resignation}} is {{a personal}} decision to exit a position, though outside pressure exists in many cases.

60|$|The supreme {{condition}} {{of success in}} a Communist revolution is {{that it should not}} paralyse industry.

All these things follow in a fatal sequence; and the end of them <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> be something quite different from what genuine Communists desire.|$|E

60|$|The use I {{have made}} of it is to put it {{carefully}} away among other treasured objects, picked up at odd times in out-of-the-way places.

The grub or mite, or whatever it is, may do so at its pleasure, and flourish and grow fat, and rear a numerous family, and get them out if it can; but all these corroding processes and changes {{going on inside the}} shell do not in the least diminish my nut's intrinsic value.|$|E
