[...] and prompts the yes/no response again - similar to the [...] "but thou must" [...] response in Dragon Warrior. In addition, as all three princesses will have committed to marrying all three forms of Kuros, the original plan for the game's ending was for the three princesses to come together and see their heroes whom they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry,</b> only to find out all three princesses promised to marry the same person. To rectify the situation, Pickford called for what he referred to as [...] "the ultimate cheapo cop-out", where a UFO abducts Kuros with a teleport beam, sending him into the future and setting the stage for the next sequel which would have been called Lasersword. However, this never came to be.|$|E
