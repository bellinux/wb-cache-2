25|$|One {{of those}} named, Bernard Delfont, was upset when his support was revealed, feeling that Maxwell should <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> before doing so. Critics {{pointed to the}} fact that Maxwell's Pergamon Press printed a large number of its {{textbooks}} and scientific journals in Eastern European countries.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{contemporary}} poet Martial, Nero also held Nerva's literary abilities in high esteem, hailing him as the [...] "Tibullus of our time". Another prominent member of Nero's entourage was Vespasian, an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 40s. It appears Vespasian befriended Nerva during his time as an imperial advisor, and may <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to watch over Vespasian's youngest son Domitian when Vespasian departed for the Jewish war in 67.|$|E
500|$|As {{the tour}} went on, there was {{discussion}} {{at a high}} level over Jardine's future. The M.C.C. authorities had realised that Bodyline was dangerous and should not be continued, but some figures such as Lord Hawke did not want to let Jardine down. Australians saw him as more of a problem; the likes of Alexander Hore-Ruthven wanted guarantees that Jardine would not use Bodyline and even that he not play. Plum Warner also believed that Jardine should no longer captain. Jardine himself saved the English selectors from any possible dilemma. In March 1934, he first told Surrey that he would be unable to play regularly any more and he resigned as captain. Then in an announcement in the Evening Standard, he stated that [...] "I have neither the intention nor the desire to play cricket against Australia this summer." [...] It is unclear whether this was due to the pressure over Bodyline, over assurances that the M.C.C. may <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to give or simply due to financial worries. This decision effectively ended his first-class career. He never played another Test and played only two more first-class matches in England, in 1937 and 1948, and one in India in 1943–44.|$|E

2500|$|According to , Hannah named Samuel {{to commemorate}} her prayer to God for a child. [...] " [...] [...] [...] [...] called his name Samuel, saying, Because I <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> of the Lord" [...] (KJV). The Hebrew root {{rendered}} as [...] "asked" [...] in the KJV is [...] "sha’al", a word mentioned seven times in 1 Samuel 1. Once {{it is even}} mentioned in the form [...] "sha’ul", Saul’s name in Hebrew (1 Samuel 1:28).|$|E
2500|$|Reynolds joined {{several of}} his fellow {{officers}} in urging that Hooker be replaced, {{in the same way}} he had spoken out against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside after Fredericksburg. On the previous occasion, Reynolds wrote in a private letter, [...] "If we do not get some one soon who can command an army without consulting 'Stanton and Halleck' at Washington, I do not know what will become of this Army." [...] President Abraham Lincoln met with Reynolds in a private interview on June 2 and is believed to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> whether he would consider being the next commander of the Army of the Potomac. Reynolds supposedly replied that {{he would be willing to}} accept only if he were given a free hand and could be isolated from the political influences that had affected the Army commanders throughout the war. Unable to comply with his demands, Lincoln promoted the more junior George G. Meade to replace Hooker on June 28.|$|E
2500|$|From August 4 to 12, 1850, the Melvilles {{and their}} {{neighbor}} Sarah Morewood, Evert Duyckinck, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and other literary figures from New York and Boston, came to Pittsfield {{to enjoy a}} period of social parties, picnics, dinners, and the like. On August 5, Nathaniel Hawthorne and his publisher James T. Fields joined the group, while Hawthorne's wife stayed at home {{to look after the}} children. As the men took a stroll through Ice Glen, someone noticed that Hawthorne and Melville were absent, and the group went looking for the two, who were at last found [...] "deep in conversation." [...] The following day, the group visited the Hawthornes, who since May had been living in nearby Lenox. [...] "I liked Melville so much," [...] Hawthorne wrote to his friend Horatio Bridge, [...] "that I <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to spend a few days with me," [...] an uncharacteristic move for a man so attached to his work that he would not suffer overnight guests to keep him from it. The following days, Melville wrote the essay [...] "Hawthorne and His Mosses," [...] a review of Hawthorne's Mosses from an Old Manse that appeared in two installments, on August 17 and 24, in The Literary World.|$|E
