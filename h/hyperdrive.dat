5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's <b>hyperdrive</b> works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} civilization, Humanity, obtained {{plans for}} the construction of a stargate after the Arcean civilization initiated first contact with them. Human scientists realized that, with the inclusion of a fusion power source, the technology behind the stargates could be modified to create a <b>hyperdrive</b> engine. <b>Hyperdrive</b> allowed starships to travel great distances on their own.|$|E
25|$|In {{the game}} universe, stars have single planets, {{each with a}} space station in its orbit. Stars are always {{separated}} by interstellar distances effectively untraversable using the ship's sublight engines. Travel between stars is accomplished by hyperspace jumps, and is constrained to those within range of the limited fuel capacity (a maximum of 7 light years) of the ship's <b>hyperdrive.</b> Sublight fuel capacity is apparently infinite.|$|E
5000|$|Interstellar {{transport}} in Star Wars {{is provided}} by <b>hyperdrives.</b> <b>Hyperdrives</b> transport the spaceship which {{they are a part}} of into another dimension, known as hyperspace, in which objects with mass are capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. Although empty, hyperspace is permeated by [...] "mass shadows" [...] of objects in realspace. Any object in hyperspace colliding with one of these mass shadows is destroyed, so in order to navigate safely, starships must utilize Hyperspace lanes, such as the Corellian Trade Spine. These lanes are devoid of realspace mass shadows, enabling long distance travel along them.|$|R

25|$|On patrol, Han and Chewbacca {{discover}} the meteor Luke {{had planned to}} investigate is actually a probe droid, which alerts the Empire to the Rebels’ location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack, using AT-AT Walkers to capture the base. Despite great resistance, the Walkers destroy the base's shield generator and force the Rebels to retreat. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but the <b>hyperdrive</b> malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer and eventually kiss. Vader summons bounty hunters, including the notorious Boba Fett, to assist in finding the Falcon. Luke, meanwhile, escapes with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter and crash-lands on the swamp planet Dagobah. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his student. Yoda trains Luke as a Jedi, and raises his sunken ship from the swamp {{with the power of}} the Force, after Luke claims it to be impossible.|$|E
25|$|Season three premiered in the United States on July 14, 2006, {{picking up}} where season 2 ended. Having stopped the Wraith from {{reaching}} Earth and {{having failed to}} develop a working Wraith retrovirus, the expedition faces its third year in the Pegasus galaxy with the Wraith still a threat and a new, powerful enemy bent on destroying the expedition and Atlantis: the Asurans, self-replicating nanobots, also known as Replicators. The situation becomes complicated when an experiment gone awry drains their only ZPM, leaving them without a power source for the city's shields. Soon thereafter, they find a lost Ancient vessel and unwillingly turn over the city of Atlantis to its crew. The SGC sends General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey to try to negotiate an agreement between Earth and the Ancients to allow the expedition to return to Atlantis. The Ancients are then subsequently killed by an invading Asuran force while O'Neill and Woolsey send off a distress call to earth and go into hiding. The main members of the Atlantis expedition on Earth disobey their orders {{and go back to}} the city, rescue O'Neill and Woolsey, and repel the Asuran invasion. The season finale starts off with Earth launching a first strike against the Asurans, who are building an armada to attack Earth. The Asurans counterattack by attacking Atlantis with a powerful beam weapon fired through a satellite housing a Stargate. As a last resort, the Atlantis team fires up the city's stardrive and escapes into space. The finale ends when the <b>hyperdrive</b> malfunctions, leaving the city flying through uncharted space with a day's worth of energy left in their sole ZPM and Dr. Weir critically injured.|$|E
5000|$|Features of the {{postulated}} future {{include an}} Earth {{governed by a}} World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" [...] in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as <b>hyperdrives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 6ixth Session is a {{drum and}} bass {{compilation}} album mixed by Dieselboy, and included {{for the first}} time a second unmixed CD of complete original tracks. It was released by Palm Pictures on March 28, 2000. The 6ixth Session featured a cyborg-themed mix described by the Washington Post as “hard-edged <b>hyperdriven</b> dance music.” This project marked the beginning of Dieselboy’s VIP remix phase.|$|R
5000|$|Each species's <b>hyperdrives</b> {{works on}} a unique [...] "frequency", {{a fact that the}} renegade Ancient {{scientist}} Janus took advantage of when creating the Attero device: {{a weapon of mass destruction}} intended to disrupt the hyperspace window generated by any Wraith ship in the galaxy, instantly vaporizing the ship as it entered the window. This device was ultimately abandoned by Janus due to unforeseen, yet catastrophic side-effects on the Stargate network: causing active gates to explode, destroying most or all of the planet on which it resides.|$|R
500|$|In space suits, Sheppard and Zelenka {{reach the}} {{controls}} and repair them, {{but in the}} process Zelenka is injured by a micro-asteroid. By then, Atlantis has lost too much power to jump again. Furthermore, Sheppard learns McKay has disobeyed his order and angrily tells him to deactivate the nanites. Weir, having apparently fully recovered, regains consciousness. When she learns the nanites are keeping her alive, she warns Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) that saving her this way is a bad idea. McKay apologises to Sheppard, and they continue working. In the end, McKay decides to use an experimental Jumper with a <b>hyperdrive</b> he worked on since [...] "Tao of Rodney" [...] and use it to steal a Zero Point Module from the Asuran homeworld.|$|E
500|$|Darth Vader {{is ordered}} by the Emperor (Carter) to capture Luke and turn him {{to the dark side}} of the Force. Vader {{recruits}} bounty hunters to track down and capture Luke's friends, intending to use them as bait to trap Luke, including Raggedy Andy, whom he orders to leave. With the Millennium Falcons <b>hyperdrive</b> broken, Han and company escape by hiding amongst a field of disposed trash, but are tracked by Boba Fett (Ernie the Giant Chicken), after hitting a [...] "space bum" [...] collecting some of the garbage. Luke has a premonition that his friends are in danger and leaves Dagobah to save them, although he has not finished his Jedi training. Yoda initially doesn't want him to go, but encourages it after Luke suggests Yoda fight Vader himself.|$|E
500|$|Amidala's ship {{is damaged}} {{as they pass}} the Federation {{blockade}} and becomes unable to use its <b>hyperdrive,</b> landing for repairs on the desert planet Tatooine. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Amidala (in disguise {{as one of her}} handmaidens) visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase new parts at a junk shop. They meet the shop's owner, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, who is a gifted pilot and engineer, and has created a protocol droid called C-3PO. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin, and is convinced that he is the [...] "chosen one" [...] of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force. Qui-Gon wagers Anakin's freedom with Watto in a Podrace, which Anakin wins. Anakin joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving his mother Shmi behind. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon encounters Darth Maul, Darth Sidious's apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. A duel ensues, but Qui-Gon quickly disengages and escapes on board the starship.|$|E
50|$|The Vaygr are {{a warrior}} clan {{originally}} from Vay, an isolated {{planet in the}} eastern fringes of the galaxy. The discovery of early and inefficient <b>hyperdrives</b> enabled these warriors to travel and raid widely across their sector of space. Always a nomadic race, the strongest warlords brought groups together into crusades. A Vaygr crusade is entirely independent. The build capacity of their Motherships (Also known as flagships) combined with the resource harvesting of their individual craft enable them to live self-sufficiently in space. Communication between separate Vaygr crusades is minimal.|$|R

On Earth, although no one seriously believes the Kzin will stay away, the ARM returns to its old habits of trying to eliminate all knowledge and technology of war. We Made It continues to create <b>hyperdrives,</b> as the Human military forces attempt to reverse-engineer Kzinti gravity technology. They also attempt to locate and form an anti-Kzin alliance with the Pierin aliens (although according to the Ringworld RPG, the Pierin may already be enslaved at this point).|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Dieselboy {{released}} his fourth mix CD, [...] "A Soldier's Story" [...] on the Moonshine label. It opened {{with his first}} original “intro” and marked his CD debut as a producer with Atlantic State, a track co-produced with Technical Itch. Also released on the Moonshine label was System Upgrade (2000) while Dieselboy joined forces with Palm Pictures/Island Recordings and his releases The Descent, Invid, Render. The 6ixth Session was a double CD release on Palm Pictures, featuring a cyborg-themed mix described by the Washington Post as “hard-edged <b>hyperdriven</b> dance music".|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the TIE fighter, {{a variety of other}} TIE craft appear throughout the films. Darth Vader flies a TIE Advanced in Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back introduces a TIE shuttle and TIE bombers, which ferry Captain Needa (Michael Culver) to Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer and bomb asteroids in the hunt for the Millennium Falcon, respectively. Both TIE craft have a design that stems from an unused [...] "TIE boarding craft" [...] concept developed for A New Hope. The TIE bomber's double-hull design led ILM's modelmakers to dub the ship a [...] "double chili dog" [...] fighter. TIE interceptors — faster TIE fighters with dagger-shaped wings and four laser cannons — appear at various points in Return of the Jedi. Two scales of TIE interceptor models were used during filming. The Force Awakens features TIE/FO starfighters that have deflector shields and special operations TIE/SF fighters with heavier weapons, a <b>hyperdrive,</b> and shields. [...] "Flatter, fang-like" [...] TIE Striker interceptors [...] appear in Rogue One (2016). [...] features the TIE Silencer, the personal starfighter of Kylo Ren.|$|E
500|$|... "Lifeline" [...] first {{surfaced}} in February 2007. Carl Binder {{wanted to do}} a heist episode during the off-season, though the writers had no idea where it would fit in the overall season arc. However, as [...] "Adrift" [...] was written, they realized their heist story flowed naturally from it. Even though Martin Wood was credited for directing the episode, Andy Mikita ended up directing most of it instead, as well as directing parts of [...] "Adrift"; Wood was directing [...] at the time of filming. Amanda Tapping requested that showrunners Mallozzi and Mullie not give her a big part for the episode, as she was in the Arctic filming for Stargate: Continuum. Another reason that Carter's appearance was small was that Torri Higginson was still a part of the show, and the producers wanted Carter to be introduced slowly. The episode, as a [...] "third part", was difficult to write, since the second part ("Adrift") is a comeback resolve of the first part ("First Strike"), and the third part has to [...] "resolve the resolve." [...] In the writing stages, there was also talk {{as to whether or not}} to save the experimental <b>hyperdrive</b> jumper. Eventually it was decided that it would be saved, to keep open the possibility of using it again.|$|E
500|$|Star Wars {{literature}} {{states that}} Sienar Fleet Systems manufactures TIE fighters and most TIE variants. TIE fighters' solar panels power a twin ion engine (TIE) system that accelerates gases {{at a high}} speed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability. Described as lacking a <b>hyperdrive</b> or shield generators, the fragile TIE fighters are deployed in large numbers from bases or larger ships; a Star Destroyer carries a wing of 72 various TIE craft. Expanded Universe material holds that TIE fighter pilots, who undergo intense physical and psychological testing, are trained to be intensely loyal to Emperor Palpatine and the Empire, willing to sacrifice themselves and their wingmates to accomplish their mission. TIE pilots were seen as expendable assets, as it was far cheaper to manufacture {{a great deal of}} standardized spacecraft in overwhelming numbers than it was to fully equip the craft. A TIE fighter consists of the absolute minimum necessary to function as a spacecraft, being essentially nothing more than a cockpit with an engine and weapons. Although Expanded Universe material often describes TIE fighters as lacking an ejection seat, the player can eject from TIE craft in LucasArts' [...] flight simulator. During the events of The Force Awakens, the First Order sees the value in its TIE pilots and equips its TIE fighters with shields to protect their occupants. The First Order also upgraded the TIE fighter to have missiles and a co-pilot/gunner A TIE fighter stolen by Poe Dameron and Finn in The Force Awakens has an ejection seat, allowing both characters to survive a crash.|$|E
50|$|In {{the events}} of Ringworld, Nessus {{inadvertently}} reveals to Wu and Speaker-to-Animals that the Man-Kzin Wars were engineered by the Puppeteers. The Puppeteers viewed the Kzin as too dangerous and hoped a series of wars in which generations of the most aggressive Kzinti males were killed off by humans would help breed reason into the Kzinti as the preferred alternative over outright extermination. To that end, the Puppeteers used a starseed lure on Procyon {{to ensure that the}} Outsiders would equip mankind with <b>hyperdrives,</b> knowing that it would be the tool that would allow victory for humans.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Inspector's Teeth" [...] {{is set on}} {{a future}} Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the {{paramount}} great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias ("Interplanetary Tours" [...] in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is common between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems, though limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as <b>hyperdrives.</b> Most reachable systems have life-bearing planets inhabited by alien races; an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples.|$|R
50|$|The second trap {{does not}} go as well. Like in the first, the Guard ambushes the second force (this time laying a dense field of hypermines, which account {{for a quarter of}} the million Achuultani vessels), but some of Sorkar's {{couriers}} had escaped and warned Hothan's fleet of the nova trap, so that stratagem was unusable. Instead, Colin traps Hothan's forces in normal space (again, using the Enchanach Drive's side effect to exploit the <b>hyperdrive's</b> limitation of being unable to work in a sufficiently deep gravity well). With a good deal of luck and a well-timed planetoid assault on the flank, the Achuultani command structure disintegrates and they are routed.|$|R
2500|$|When {{they reach}} the {{vicinity}} of the Ringworld, they are unable to contact anyone, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworld's automated meteoroid-defense system. [...] The severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands near a huge mountain. [...] Many of the ship's systems survive intact, including the faster-than-light <b>hyperdrive,</b> but the normal drive is destroyed, leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the <b>hyperdrive.</b> They set out {{to find a way to}} get home.|$|E
2500|$|Asuran {{satellite}} weapon (main article) In the Stargate Atlantis season 3 finale, [...] "First Strike", the Asurans send {{a satellite}} weapon to attack Atlantis {{in response to}} the Apollos bombing of their homeworld. The weapon consists of an eight-chevron Stargate, <b>hyperdrive,</b> shield, and a navigation system. Once it reaches its target, the Stargate activates and the Asurans fire an energy beam through.|$|E
2500|$|According to roleplaying {{and other}} material, X-wings {{depicted}} in the movies and expanded universe material that takes place around the same era are equipped with four laser cannons {{and a pair of}} proton torpedo launchers. The fighter has two flight modes: one in which the wings are flat and another when they are expanded into [...] "attack position", affording the wingtip lasers a larger fire area. [...] "S-foil" [...] servomotors control the transition between the two, hence the expression [...] "to lock s-foils in attack position". Lacking an on-board navigation computer, they rely on an astromech droid to calculate hyperspace jumps. The Rebel Alliance adopted the military strategy of Doctrine of Space Denial, wherein the Rebellion would raid Imperial boneyards and shipping frigates, both to disrupt Imperial logistics and operations, and also to requisition desperately needed materials. X-wing <b>hyperdrive</b> capabilities allowed for this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire may react. The presence of a <b>hyperdrive</b> and deflector shields differentiate the X-wing from the Empire's TIE fighters, emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions.|$|E
50|$|The Ancient Ship Destiny uses a {{different}} method of faster-than-light propulsion, simply {{referred to as}} FTL by the Destiny Expedition. Much of its workings remain unexplained. Destiny's drives, once engaged, must remain active {{for a minimum of}} four hours and, upon exiting FTL travel, must remain inactive for a minimum of three to prevent damage to the drives. Unlike sublight and <b>hyperdrives</b> on previously seen ships in both the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxies, Destiny's engines appear to be a single unit which provide both forms of propulsion. This same method of FTL is used of both the Ancient Seed Ships seen in Stargate Universe, and the Alteran city ship seen in Stargate: The Ark of Truth.|$|R
5000|$|The Asgard {{are one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{advanced}} races in the Stargate universe. They were once contemporaries of the Ancients, and learned much from them. Amongst their most significant advancements are beaming technology, intergalactic <b>hyperdrives,</b> and plasma beam weapons, all of which they have shared with Earth. The Asgard are no longer capable of sexual reproduction and instead perpetuate themselves through cloning, as they have the technology to upload and store Asgard consciousnesses and transfer them to new bodies. Neutronium is a key element of Asgard technology. Technology is a central aspect of Asgard civilization; they have become so dependent on it that their mindsets are incapable of coming up with more [...] "primitive" [...] solutions to a problem. This weakness proved critical in their war with the Replicators.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} orbit, Ivan faces another problem, as the Phantom {{does not}} have enough fuel to jump to another system, and the old fighter is no match for the Ganios orbital defenses. Ivan scans the local hypersphere force lines and determines that one of them is unmarked on all star charts (i.e. it does not lead anywhere). Realizing he has nothing to lose, Tamantsev transitions into hypersphere and uses the last of his fuel to maneuver the ship to intersect with the unmarked force line, remembering that 3 million years ago, none of the known races did not possess <b>hyperdrives</b> (it is an invention unique to humans). Instead, they used stationary portals which used the hypersphere force lines as conduits to rapidly send objects between planets. Ivans theory turns out to be correct, and his fighter enters one such conduit and rapidly travels to another system far from Ganio. Unfortunately, the conduit throws his ship out into normal space into a planets low orbit. Lacking fuel, Ivan is unable to slow down his descent and is forced to eject, while the Phantom crashes in the nearby woods. Before ejecting, Ivan notices a city protected by a giant wall not too far from the crash site.|$|R
2500|$|The {{spaceship}} HMS Camden Lock in the 2006-2007 BBC2 {{comedy series}} <b>Hyperdrive</b> bears {{the serial number}} XH558. The set and prop designer, model-maker Andrew Glazebrook, stated [...] "its registration number XH558 is actually that of the Royal Air Force's [...] "Avro Vulcan" [...] bomber and was suggested by the show's writers, Andy Riley and Kevin Cecil." [...] This direct involvement with the Avro Vulcan and {{its role as a}} military aircraft is clearly connected to its science-fiction counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Blake's 7 to {{television}} and cinema space opera {{is the use}} of moral ambiguity and dysfunctional main characters to create tension and long-term plots to aid cohesiveness. [...] These devices can be seen in Firefly, [...] Farscape, , Cowboy Bebop, Stargate Atlantis, Babylon 5, Dark Matter, [...] Lexx, Andromeda, Star Wars Rebels, and the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, among others. The influence of Blake's 7 is a source of contrasts with other science fiction franchises, such as deviation from the good-versus-evil dualism in Star Wars, ′s 'feel-good' political tone, and the more episodic structure of Doctor Who. (However, Rogue One does share its grey morality, lead antiheroes, and grim ending.) [...] Blake's 7 also influenced <b>Hyperdrive</b> and Aeon Flux.|$|E
2500|$|In the Legends novels Death Star, Dark Empire II, Jedi Search and Champions of the Force, an {{experimental}} Death Star prototype, DS-X (a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a control room) was conceived by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin {{as a test}} bed for the first Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable [...] "dead planet". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, <b>hyperdrive</b> engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{character}} of TIE Fighter is Maarek Stele, although {{his name is}} only revealed in the official strategy guide and The Stele Chronicles, a short work of fiction explaining the backstory to TIE Fighter. TIE Fighter had advanced features including Gouraud shading for more realistic polygon models, and a more advanced targeting computer (showing a miniature polygon of the targeted vessel, which allows the player to see the target's relative orientation).Besides allowing the player to fly the TIE fighters, TIE Bombers, and TIE Interceptors seen in the films, the game also adds new craft with shields, weaponry, and <b>hyperdrives.</b> These included the Cygnus Assault Gunboat, TIE Advanced [...] "Avenger", TIE Defender (added to the Star Wars: Essential Guide to Vehicles), and Cygnus Missile Gunboat (in the Defender of the Empire and Enemies of the Empire expansion packs). In fact, by the fifth campaign, the new TIE craft completely replace the movie fighters. As a result, the gameplay ends up similar to X-Wing, since the player's side does not feature mass overwhelming attacks with expendable craft (as the Empire would do {{at the height of}} its power), and often the player does not have the benefit of wingmen. This can be partially explained by the player being part of a special task force headed by Thrawn, tasked with destroying the rogue Grand Admiral Zaarin.|$|R
5000|$|The Travelers are {{humans who}} live on a fleet of ships to avoid the Wraith, {{introduced}} in [...] "Travelers". Although not as technologically advanced as the Ancients, the Travelers possess <b>hyperdrives</b> and advanced weapons. Due to their population outgrowing their available space, the Travelers {{had been forced to}} abandon some of their people on planets. Their discovery of an Aurora-class battleship promised to solve this problem, but without the ATA gene they were unable to operate it. They kidnap John Sheppard and extort him to create an interface for them. Though uncooperative at first on account of his abduction, Sheppard and the Traveler leader Larrin eventually came to an understanding after a mutual experience with the Wraith. In [...] "Be All My Sins Remember'd", the Travelers become concerned by the Asuran Replicator threat after one of their trading partners is wiped out. Several of their ships, including their Ancient battleship, join the Atlanteans and the Wraith in battling the Replicators over their homeworld. According to producers Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, the Travelers were created as a [...] "wild card" [...] like the Genii, but with advanced technology that would make them a [...] "challenge" [...] for the Atlantis team. Their lifestyle was devised as a way around the established fact that the Wraith wipe out any civilizations that approach them in technological advancement.|$|R
50|$|Humans who {{are from}} Earth are {{referred}} to as the Tau'ri by most other life forms in the galaxy, including the Goa'uld. Earth is a relatively important player on account of the radical change it unwittingly brought about when troops under the command of Colonel Jack O'Neill killed Goa'uld Supreme System Lord Ra and started a guerrilla war against the Goa'uld. However, its importance pales in comparison {{to the power of the}} System Lords or the Free Jaffa Nation, even though after the extinction of the Asgard and the defeat of the Ori, the Tau'ri became the dominant race of known space — although they were initially at a huge technological disadvantage, they later managed to reverse-engineer Goa'uld technology to the point where they started building their own ships, though much of it was rendered obsolete when the Asgard granted a significant amount of non-weapon technology. The Tau'ri also created remarkable technological feats, such as fighters equipped with <b>hyperdrives</b> powered by an unstable isotope. Their power increased further when they discovered that, due to crossbreeding with Ancients before their extinction, some Earth-born humans actually possessed a unique gene required to operate some of the more advanced Ancient technology. The peak of their power occurred when the Asgard donated their entire technological knowledge to Earth prior to their extinction. With this and some Ancient technology, the Tau'ri actually surpassed their precursors and defeated the Ori.|$|R
