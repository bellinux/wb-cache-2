Knowledge compilation underlies algorithms for ex- act probabilistic inference and parameter learning in several languages, including ProbLog, PRISM, and LPADs.

40|$|International audienceSelf-sensing {{techniques}} {{is defined}} as the use of an actuator as a sensor at the same time. The main advantage of such techniques is the embeddabil- ity and the packageability of the systems. This paper deals with the development of a self-sensing technique able to estimate the displacement, the force and the state in piezoelectric cantilevered actuators. The main novelties relative to previous works are: 1) three signals (displacement, force and states) are provided at the same time instead of only two (displacement and force), 2) and these three signals are provided in a complete way, i. e. low and high frequency information can be provided (instead of exclusively low or high frequency). It is therefore possible to further use the measurement for a displacement control or for a force control by using the output feedback methods or by using modern control methods (state-feedback). In order to allow such measurement possibilities, the proposed approach consists in combining an unknown- input-observer (UIO) with the classical electrical <b>cir-</b> <b>cuit</b> of a self-sensing.

Both gen- eration of the voltage pulses necessary for memory operation from a lower supply voltage and the interpretation of the memory response as one of two states is investigated. It is con- cluded, with some reservations, that such circuitry can be implemented using the polysilicon process. Using organic thin film transistors only the latter functionality is shown, generation of the necessary voltage pulses is not achieved but also not completely precluded. ...|$|R

One of the most efficient class of FHE schemes include BGV and FV schemes, {{which are based on}} the hardness of the RLWE problem. They share some common features: ciphertext sizes grow after each homomorphic multiplication; multiplication is much more costly than addition, and the cost of homomorphic multiplication scales linearly with the input ciphertext sizes. Furthermore, there is a special relinearization operation that reduce the size of a ciphertext, and the cost of relinearization is on the same order of magnitude as homomorpic multiplication. This motivates us to define a discrete optimization problem, which is to decide where (and how much) in a given circuit to relinearize, in order to minimize the total computational cost. In this paper, we formally define the relinearize problem. We prove that the problem is NP-hard.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a number of}} experiments with superconducting <b>cir-</b> <b>cuits</b> containing small Josephson junctions. The circuits are made out of aluminum islands which are interconnected with a very thin insulating alu- minum oxide layer. The connections form a Josephson junction. The current trough the junction {{is related to the}} superconducting phase difference across the junction and described by the well-known Josephson relation. The char- acteristic energy scale for this effect is the Josephson energy, which is a measure for the strength of the coupling of the islands. Due to the parallel plate geometry of the junction a capacitance is formed. This capacitance leads to a charging effect. The characteristic energy scale for this effect is given by the charging energy. With the shadow evaporation technique it is possible to make the Josephson junction area very small and the two characteristic energy scales of the same order of magnitude. Charge and phase are conju- gate variables. Therefore a circuit containing such small Josephson junctions exhibits quantum effects. The microfabrication technique used in this the- sis allows fabrication of solid circuits with controlled quantum mechanical behavior. Applied Science...|$|R

Principles are identified that maximize {{the benefits of}} pro- tocol verification while minimizing the labor and computation required. A new protocol description language and verifier (both called Mur') are de- scribed, along with experiences in applying them to two industrial protocols that were developed as part of hardware designs. 1 Introduction Most complex digital designs must be regarded as concur- rent systems: individual modules run in parallel and must coordinate by explicit synchronization and communication. Complexity will continue to increase, portending a shift in total design effort from, for instance, faster arithmetic <b>cir-</b> <b>cuits,</b> to mechanisms for coordination. Those mechanisms usually involve protocols: rules that, if followed by each party in a coordinated action, assure a desired outcome. Unfortunately, protocol design is a subtle art. Even when a designer exercises the utmost care, {{there is a strong}} possibility that he or she will fail to anticipate some possi- ble interaction among rules, resulting in errors and dead- locks. Even worse, the nondeterminism resulting from dif- fering internal states or delays means that resulting errors are often not reliably repeatable, making testing and de- bugging extremely difficult...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the usage of digital post-correction techniques in pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) can be exploited optimally during the design-phase of the converter. It is known that post-correction algorithms reduce the influence of several <b>cir-</b> <b>cuit</b> impairments on the final accuracy of the converter [1], [2]. However, until now, no models relating these circuit impairments to the final accuracy of the ADC, taking the usage of a post-correction algorithm into account, {{have been known to}} exist. To take maximum advantage of a certain correction algorithm, this model is a must. Therefore, this paper introduces a behavioral model of a pipelined ADC, including several important error mechanisms, representing possible circuit impairments like offset, gain error, harmonic distortion, etc. With this model, including the post-correction algorithm, simple design con- straints for each part of the circuit can be derived such that a certain target accuracy of the ADC is achieved. In the analog design-phase these high-level constraints can be translated to implementation-dependent low-level design requirements. If these low-level requirements are fulfilled, the model guarantees that the converter will achieve its target accuracy. A design-example for a 12 -bit pipelined ADC is worked out. Simulation results will be shown, validating the correctness of the presented design-method. The proposed design-strategy can be applied to all pipelined ADC's with post-correction like in [1], [2], taking maximum advantage of the benefits of the correction algorithm during the analog design-phase...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis {{techniques}} take realizable Linear Temporal Logic specifications {{and produce}} correct <b>cir-</b> <b>cuits</b> that implement the specifications. The generated circuits {{can be used}} directly, or as miters that check the correctness of a logic design. Typically, those techniques generate non-deterministic finite state automata, which can be determinized at a possibly exponential cost. Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we present a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended regular expression specification Φ, and a logic design implementation S, and generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that checks whether S satisfies Φ. The technique passes the generated circuit C to ABC, a bounded model checker, to validate correctness. We use free input variables to encode the non- determinism in Φ and we obtain {{a number of states}} in miter linear in the size of Φ. Our technique succeeds to generate the input to the model checker while other techniques fail because of the exponential blowup, and in most cases, ABC succeeds to either find defects in the design that was otherwise uncheckable, or validate the design.

40|$|Current neurobiological {{accounts}} {{of language and}} cognition offer diverging views on the questions of ‘where’ and ‘how’ semantic information is stored and processed in the human brain. Neuroimaging data showing consistent activation of different multi-modal areas during word and sentence comprehension suggest that all meanings are processed indistinctively, {{by a set of}} general semantic centres or ‘hubs’. However, words belonging to specific semantic categories selectively activate modality-preferential areas; for example, action-related words spark activity in dorsal motor cortex, whereas object-related ones activate ventral visual areas. The evidence for category-specific and category-general semantic areas begs for a unifying explanation, able to integrate the emergence of both. Here, a neurobiological model offering such an explanation is described. Using a neural architecture repli- cating anatomical and neurophysiological features of frontal, occipital and temporal cortices, basic aspects of word learning and semantic grounding in action and perception were simulated. As the network underwent training, distributed lexico-semantic <b>cir-</b> <b>cuits</b> spontaneously emerged. These circuits exhibited different cortical distributions that reached into dorsal-motor or ventral- visual areas, reflecting the correlated category-specific sensorimotor patterns that co-occurred during action- or object-related semantic grounding, respectively. Crucially, substantial numbers of neurons of both types of distributed circuits emerged in areas interfacing between modality-preferential regions, i. e. in multimodal connection hubs, which therefore became loci of general semantic binding. By relating neuroanatomical structure and cellular-level learning mechanisms with system-level cognitive func- tion, this model offers a neurobiological account of category-general and category-specific semantic areas based on the different cortical distributions of the underlying semantic circuits...|$|R
