5|$|Almost {{immediately}} the Air Force was reduced from 290to 190fixed-wing aircraft and had five of its twelve bases closed. In 2002, the Armée XXI reforms continued {{the pattern of}} reduction, with bases at Mollis, Turtmann, and Interlaken closed, jets relocated out of Dübendorf (later planned <b>for</b> <b>closing),</b> and the helicopter base at Alpnach placed on the closure list. These closures left Payerne, Sion, and Meiringen as the only combat bases, Emmen as the main helicopter base, and Locarno as a training base. Buochs was maintained for war-time reactivation, and the theoretical plan for using highways near Payerne, Sion, and Lodrino as emergency runways was retained, although no pilots have been trained in their use since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange <b>for</b> <b>closing</b> the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible <b>for</b> <b>closing</b> and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
