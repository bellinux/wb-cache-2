No formal investigation was launched until 2000, after three former Croatian intelligence and military police officers informed the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia about the killings. Five, including Orešković and Norac, were arrested in 2001 and tried.

2500|$|The hearing, which {{concluded}} Gilles de Rais was not <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes,</b> {{was partially}} {{turned into a}} fictionalized biography called Gilles de Rais ou la Gueule du loup, narrated by the writer Gilbert Prouteau. [...] "The case for Gilles de Rais's innocence is very strong," [...] Prouteau said. [...] "No child's corpse was ever found at his castle at Tiffauges and {{he appears to have}} confessed to escape excommunication...The accusations appear to be false charges made up by powerful rival lords to benefit from <b>the</b> confiscation <b>of</b> his lands." [...] However, the journalist Gilbert Philippe from the newspaper Ouest-France, said that Prouteau was being [...] "facetious and provocative". He also claimed that Prouteau thought the retrial was basically [...] "an absolute joke". Historians continue to believe him <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crimes,</b> mainly differing as to his motivation.|$|R

The prisoners appeared at trial, before Chief Justice Tindal, Justice Joseph Littledale and Baron Vaughan, at the Old Bailey between 2 and 3 December.

25|$|If a {{defendant}} is {{sentenced to death}} at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review. The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result {{in one of three}} outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not <b>guilty,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.|$|E

25|$|The {{experience}} of the Japanese occupation of Burma worked to alienate the nationalists {{as well as the}} population at large. Toward the end of the Second World War, on 27 March 1945 the Burma National Army (successor to the BIA) turned against the Japanese following the British re-invasion of Burma. Ne Win, as one of the BNA Commanders, was quick to establish links with the British – attending the Kandy conference in Ceylon and taking charge of the anti-Communist operations in the Pyinmana area as commander of the 4th Burma Rifles after the Red Flag Communists and the Communist Party of Burma went underground to fight against the government in October 1946 and on 28 March 1948 respectively. Burma obtained independence on 4 January 1948, and for the first 14 years it had a parliamentary and democratic government mainly under Prime Minister U Nu, but the country was riven with political division. Even before independence, Aung San was assassinated together with six of his cabinet members on 19 July 1947; U Saw, a pre-war prime minister and political rival of Aung San, was found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> and executed. U Nu as leader of the Socialists took charge of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the Communists, Socialists and the BNA in 1945 now that Aung San was dead and the Communists expelled from the AFPFL.|$|E
25|$|Rape {{was first}} {{recognised}} {{as a crime}} against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foca (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture, and sexual enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. The indictment was of major legal significance and {{was the first time that}} sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as {{a crime against humanity}}. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniac (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in Foca, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Tom Flanagan, a {{conservative}} {{professor of political}} science at the University of Calgary, has argued that Conservapedia is more about religion, specifically Christianity, than conservatism and that it [...] "is far more <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> they're attributing to Wikipedia" [...] than Wikipedia itself. Matt Millham of the military-oriented newspaper Stars and Stripes called Conservapedia [...] "a Web site that caters mostly to evangelical Christians". Its scope as an encyclopedia, according to its founders, [...] "offers a historical record from a Christian and conservative perspective". APC magazine perceives this to be representative of Conservapedia's own problem with bias. Conservative Christian commentator Rod Dreher has been highly critical of the website's [...] "Conservative Bible Project", an ongoing retranslation of the Bible which Dreher attributes to [...] "insane hubris" [...] on the part of [...] "right-wing ideologues".|$|E

500|$|During Kwaśniewski's {{visit to}} Russia in September 2004, Russian {{officials}} {{announced that they}} were willing to transfer all the information on the Katyn massacre to the Polish authorities as soon as it became declassified. In March 2005 the Prosecutor-General’s Office of the Russian Federation concluded a decade-long investigation of the massacre. Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Savenkov announced that the investigation was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 out of 14,542 Polish citizens who had been sentenced to death while in three Soviet camps. He did not address the fate of about 7,000 victims who had not been in POW camps, but in prisons. Savenkov declared that the massacre was not a genocide, that Soviet officials who had been found <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> were dead and that, consequently, [...] "there is absolutely no basis to talk about this in judicial terms". 116 out of 183 volumes of files gathered during the Russian investigation were declared to contain state secrets and were classified.|$|E
500|$|Prosecutors {{agreed that}} Cisneros was guilty {{under the law}} of the parties - that she was <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> of murder even though she did not commit the crime directly. However, {{prosecutors}} failed to word her charge appropriately, suggesting that Cisneros [...] "directly" [...] hired Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez to murder Fischer instead of working through intermediaries. On February 14, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi ordered Cisneros released on a US$50,000 bond, about one-sixth of the original bond posted for her trial. The order stated that the prosecution did not agree to the bail, but the document stated they had failed to file the appropriate paperwork within the mandatory ten days. On February 22, a judge ordered her released from prison. She was unavailable for comment, and it was not known if she returned to Brownsville. Fischer's family denounced the ruling and said the appeals court [...] "seemed to have lost sight" [...] that their son was killed. Brownsville prosecutors said even if there was not enough evidence to convict Cisneros for capital murder, she could still be convicted of ordinary murder, since the appeal was approved because there was no direct evidence linking Cisneros with a murder-for-hire charge. The reversal was upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in November 1996.|$|E
