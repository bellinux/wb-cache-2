50|$|A <b>drawer</b> <b>pull</b> (wire pull {{or simply}} pull) is a handle {{to pull a}} drawer out of a chest of drawers, cabinet or other {{furniture}} piece.|$|E
50|$|Series 8 {{and some}} late model Series 7 {{locomotives}} were equipped with doors {{on which the}} outside door latch handle was mounted near floor level with a simple <b>drawer</b> <b>pull</b> type handle at mid-door level.|$|E
50|$|They {{produce a}} range of {{residential}} lock products, including tubular locks, key locking hardware sets, electronic keyless locks, deadbolts, and Mortise locks. They also provide cabinet and <b>drawer</b> <b>pulls</b> for interior spaces like Kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.|$|R
50|$|Most commonly, {{one or two}} handles or <b>drawer</b> <b>pulls</b> are {{attached}} to the front face of the <b>drawer</b> to facilitate <b>pulling</b> it out from its enclosure. In some cases, drawers may have another means by which to pull it, including holes cut in the front face or a hollowed-out area to insert the fingers on the bottom side of the front face of the drawer.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal pull handles are widespread, {{including}} <b>drawer</b> <b>pulls,</b> handles on latchless {{doors and}} the outside of car doors. The inside controls for opening car doors from inside are usually pull handles, although their function of permitting the door to be pushed open is accomplished by an internal unlatching linkage.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>drawer</b> <b>pull</b> often {{includes}} a plate {{to which the}} handle is fastened. The handle may swing from one or two mounts ("drop handle" [...] or [...] "swing handle"), making a drop <b>drawer</b> <b>pull.</b> A bail handle {{is a kind of}} swing handle consisting of an open loop attached to two mounts. The handle may also be fastened to the plate with rivets, making it immovable. The plate may be ornamented by piercing, embossing, or both. The ornament may also be cut on the surface with tools, leaving it sunken into the metal. The stock for handles may be round, rectangular, or irregular forged shapes.|$|E
50|$|A bail handle, {{or simply}} bail, is a handle that {{consists}} of an open loop that moves freely within two fixed mounts. It {{may be used for}} carrying an item, such as a bucket or kettle, or as a <b>drawer</b> <b>pull.</b>|$|E
50|$|Late-model Series 7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} side doors {{on which the}} outside door latch handle was mounted near floor level with a simple <b>drawer</b> <b>pull</b> type handle at mid-door level. Unit no. E1845 and later numbers were observed with such lower mounted door handles. Unit no. E1882 was one observed exception with a high-mounted door handle, although {{this may have been}} the result of a door replacement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible at {{this time}} of night," [...] {{answered}} Sir Henry; [...] "but tired horses may do much with care and looking to." [...] He went hastily to the cabinet which stood in one of the oriel windows, and searched for something in the <b>drawers,</b> <b>pulling</b> out one after another.|$|R
5000|$|Commodes {{were made}} by ébénistes; the French word for [...] "cabinet-maker" [...] is derived from ebony, a black {{tropical}} hardwood notable as a foreign luxury. The beautiful wood was complemented with ormolu (gilt-bronze <b>drawer</b> <b>pulls).</b> The piece of furniture would be provided with a marble slab top selected to match the marble of the chimneypiece.|$|R

5000|$|By 1918, the company's {{products}} (in {{addition to}} the lenses and lamps) were lantern globes, colored and crystal specialties, and food preservation ware such as canisters and fruit jars. [...] Around 1920, the company began making an interesting (but less important) product—a wall-mounted mail box. These mailboxes were made of glass, enabling one to easily see if mail had been delivered. Sneath employee William Chapman, working {{under the supervision of}} Ray Pruden, was granted a patent for the glass mailbox in 1921. Ray Pruden was superintendent of the factory, assuming that title after Henry Crimmel’s stroke. William Chapman was a well-known glass blower who also secured a patent for an ash tray. [...] Employees of the company also patented other products, including a <b>drawer</b> <b>pull,</b> a caster for furniture, a newspaper receptacle, and a chick feeding fount. [...] Years later, the glass mailbox was shown in Popular Mechanics magazine.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} {{comes with}} over 800 unique objects and actors {{that relate to}} each other like real world counterparts. Drag an actor to a chair and he sits, drag a gun or cigarette to a hand and it will be held, dresser <b>drawers</b> <b>pull</b> open and trees can lose their leaves. Further, actor features like ‘reach-for’ and ‘look-at’ simplify posing that can be modified down to a single finger's joint.|$|R
25|$|The hall {{originally}} seated 2,901. The cantilevered {{boxes are}} {{often described as}} looking like <b>drawers</b> <b>pulled</b> out in a hurried burglary, but none has a compromised sightline. The ceiling was wilfully sculptural, a conceit at {{the very edge of}} building technology and, as it turns out, way beyond the contemporary understanding of acoustics. Robin Day, who designed the furniture for the auditorium, used a clearly articulated structure in his designs of bent plywood and steel.|$|R
5000|$|Furniture {{was made}} thoughtfully, with {{functional}} form and proportion. Rather than using ornamentation — such as inlays, carvings, metal pulls, or veneers — which {{was seen as}} prideful or deceitful, they developed [...] "creative solutions such as asymmetrical drawer arrangements and multipurpose forms to add visual interest." [...] Furniture was made of cherry, maple or pine lumber, which was generally stained or painted {{with one of the}} colors which were dictated by the sect, typically blue, red, yellow or green. <b>Drawer</b> <b>pulls</b> for dressers or other furniture were made of wood.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled his}} own drawing-table to the window, set out his board and colour-box, filled a great {{glass from the}} {{seltzer-water}} bottle, drank some of the vapid liquor, and plunged his brushes in the rest, with which he began to paint. The work all went wrong. There was no song for him over his labour; he dashed brush and board aside after a while, opened his <b>drawers,</b> <b>pulled</b> out his portmanteaus from under the bed, and fell to packing mechanically. J. J. heard the noise from the next room, and came in smiling, with a great painting-brush in his mouth.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a hidden}} garden {{revealed}} {{only when a}} vast <b>drawer</b> is <b>pulled</b> out from beneath the main building. This has replicas of greenery and garden implements and follows a traditional ornamental garden theme.|$|R
60|$|Except {{that the}} body had been carried to {{the bed in the}} inner chamber, all {{remained}} as it had been found. There were no signs of robbery--not even of a struggle. The cushions of the easy-chair still bore the impress of the sitter's weight; the footstool was hardly pushed aside; the massive library table was undisturbed; the silver spoons and sugar-tongs beside the tumbler and plate on the supper tray; the yellow light of the lamp still burnt; not a paper was ruffled, not a <b>drawer</b> <b>pulled</b> out. Only a rifle stood leaning against the window shutter, and towards it both friend and brother went at once, hoping and trusting {{that it would be a}} stranger to their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Damn your father! What's {{the good}} of a guinea?' He went to a <b>drawer</b> and <b>pulled</b> out a handful of gold--the tithes had been paid {{a couple of days}} before. 'Here are ten; a man can go to hell on ten guineas.' ...|$|R
5000|$|.....This evening Wilkes and a {{half dozen}} of his {{followers}} went to Father Szymanowski's residence. They were received pleasantly by the pastor. Wilkes stated his mission, demanding that the priest surrender the church books, give up the keys {{of the house and}} vacate the premises. Before the visitors were aware of it, the priest reached to a bureau <b>drawer,</b> <b>pulled</b> out a revolver, and pointing at the men said: 'Now you fellows have made trouble enough in this congregation. I will have you understand this is my house and I want you to get out at once or I will compel you to.' Wilkes didn't wait to hear any more. He and his party fled. Wilkes and his followers now threaten to burn the building. The priest has stationed himself at the window up stairs, revolver in hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|Door Mounting. For both face-frame and {{frameless}} kitchen cabinets, it is conventional for cabinet {{doors to}} overlay the cabinet carcase. Face-frame cabinets allow for various door mounting options. Traditional overlay doors do not abut, allowing a partial {{view of the}} face frames when the doors are closed. Full overlay cabinet doors fit closely so that they obscure the face frame when closed. A third and less conventional option for face-frame cabinets is to inset doors into, and flush with, the face frame (see below). Since frameless (see below) cabinet doors also fully overlay their carcases, the two types (frameless and full-overlay face-frame cabinets) have a similar installed appearance (when doors are closed), both may use European cup hinges, and both tend to use decorative door and <b>drawer</b> <b>pulls</b> (since {{there is no room}} for fingers at the door or drawer edge when installed).|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, most male - and some female - Ainscoughs {{in the villages}} of Blackrod, Haigh, Aspull were coal miners. They started as <b>drawers,</b> <b>pulling</b> coal carts, {{at the age of}} ten (until this was stopped by legislation), graduating to miners at around the age of sixteen. The area was rich in cannel coal, a high-grade, rich but {{volatile}} coal, and many mines were on the estate of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres who lived at Haigh Hall. All but one of the five sons of Ralph (b.1782 in Blackrod) were miners - and nearly all male descendants of these Ainscoughs were also miners, as censuses from 1841 to 1901 attest. In the 1850s and 1860s, some of the Ainscough miners moved further afield to Westhoughton, Pemberton, Hindley and Ince, with some members of their families going into the silk and cotton weaving industries.|$|R
500|$|In a third incident, {{a disgruntled}} {{constituent}} {{walked into his}} office, with a gun drawn and reportedly said [...] "Don Chafin, I'm gonna' shoot you dead." [...] Chafin reached into his desk <b>drawer</b> and <b>pulled</b> out a pistol of his own, and said, [...] "Go ahead. [...] We'll hop into Hell together." [...] The man left without firing a shot.|$|R
50|$|The scandal became {{nationwide}} {{news and}} a continuing top story in New York City. A fictionalized version {{served as the}} basis for the original pilot episode of the television series Law & Order, Everybody's Favorite Bagman. Manes, now facing the prospect of indictment on corruption charges, stayed in seclusion until March. On the night of March 13, he took a phone call from his psychiatrist, who discussed additional care with Manes (and his wife on an extension phone upstairs). Shortly before 10 p.m. the psychiatrist was called away from the phone and, while on hold, Manes reached into a kitchen <b>drawer,</b> <b>pulled</b> out a large kitchen knife and plunged the eight-inch blade into his heart. His daughter screamed for her mother, who came down to find Manes on the floor in a pool of blood. Marlene Manes pulled the knife from his heart as their daughter frantically called 911. Donald Manes was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|R
60|$|Marcia {{pushed into}} the room where she had left Bartley. She had no escape from her fate; she must meet it, {{whatever}} it was. The room was empty, and she began doggedly to search the house for him, up stairs and down, carrying the child with her. She {{would not have been}} afraid now to call him; but she had no voice, and she could not ask the servant anything when she looked into the kitchen. She saw the traces of the meal he had made in the dining-room, and when she went a second time to their chamber to lay the little girl down in her crib, she saw the <b>drawers</b> <b>pulled</b> open, and the things as he had tossed them about in packing his bag. She looked at the clock on the mantel--an extravagance of Bartley's, for which she had scolded him--and it was only half past eight; she had thought it must be midnight.|$|R
60|$|I was for {{the first}} time really vexed. I went to the nearest <b>drawer</b> and <b>pulled</b> it out sharply. It stuck as it had before, leaving a part of the drawer unopened. By working it, however, I {{discovered}} that it was impeded by some obstacle that had slipped to {{the upper part of the}} drawer, and held it firmly fast. Inserting my hand, I pulled out the impeding object. It was the missing cigar case! I turned to him with a cry of joy.|$|R
50|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Holy Mysteries (reserved sacrament) {{are kept}} in a {{tabernacle}} (Greek: αρτοφοριον/artophorion) or ark (Slavonic: ковчег/kovchég) on the altar at all times. The tabernacle is normally wrought of gold, silver, or wood and elaborately decorated. It is often shaped like a miniature church building, and usually has a cross {{on the top of}} it. It may be opened using small doors, or a <b>drawer</b> that <b>pulls</b> out. Some churches keep the tabernacle under a glass dome to protect it (and the Holy Mysteries) from dust and changes in humidity.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of April 14, 2009, {{authorities}} say that Rachel Wade was alone in her apartment waiting for Joshua Camacho. Camacho was watching movies with Ludemann. While Wade was outside walking her dog, she heard a car honk and she stated that Ludemann yelled, [...] "Stay away from my man!" [...] Wade {{said that she was}} scared and she decided to call an old boyfriend, Javier. He told her to come over to his house. She got her purse, opened a kitchen <b>drawer</b> and <b>pulled</b> out a steak knife.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "That's it! Now then!" [...] They each grasp {{a handle}} of the <b>drawer</b> and <b>pull.</b> [...] "One, two, three--pull! Once more--pull! Now the third time--pull! And out she comes!" [...] The bolt {{suddenly}} gives and the drawer drops violently to the floor, scattering its contents in every direction, while the two men totter backward and cling to each other to keep their balance. At the same moment the voices of Mrs. Roberts and Mrs. Campbell make themselves heard without in vague cries of astonishment, question, and apprehension, mounting into a wild shriek as the drawer crashes to the floor.|$|R
