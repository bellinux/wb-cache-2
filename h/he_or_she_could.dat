5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E

His/her position, training, technical knowledge and scientific expertise vary considerably with the disciplines, times, places and even the editorial project itself. The illustrator could be the scientist himself, or a collaborator possessing a deep knowledge of the scientific discipline in which he/she participates; <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> also <b>could</b> be an anonymous technician who produces images respecting the demands of an author.

25|$|For example, {{consider}} national defense, {{a standard}} {{example of a}} pure public good. Suppose homo economicus thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all {{of the millions of}} other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.|$|E
25|$|Shaping {{involves}} gradually {{modifying the}} existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages {{with a dog}} by hitting it, then <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in {{which he or she}} touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{animation}} technique rotoscoping and how abstraction of an animation’s information affects the viewer’s perception. This {{problem has been}} studied through creating three rotoscoping animations. These animations have been viewed and discussed in focus groups and {{the result has been}} analyzed through a semiotics and representation theoretical perspective. The result shows that the more abstract an animation is, the harder it is to understand meaningful information in it. This study also covers the significance of cultural and contextual aspects on how meaning is formed and shows on the result that if a viewer is familiar with the subject of the animation, {{the more likely it is}} that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> easier <b>could</b> understand the animation...|$|R

50|$|Where the {{property}} specified belongs jointly to the testator {{and to a}} third person {{it is clear that}} the testator cannot override the rights of the co-owner; the testator’s will cannot do more than <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> personally <b>could</b> do and the legacy is not binding on the co-owner. There is a presumption in such a case that only the testator’s share is bequeathed if it is doubtful from the will whether the testator intended to burden his or her estate with the duty of buying out the co-owner’s share. This presumption may, however, be rebutted and more easily so where the testator bequeaths property belonging jointly to the testator and his or her spouse. If {{the property}} bequeathed belongs jointly to the testator and to the residuary heir, the whole of the property is deemed to be bequeathed; but the heir has an election whether to accept the terms of the will or to keep his or her share of the property.|$|R
25|$|Although the defense's expert {{testimony}} agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, {{in order to}} successfully assert the insanity defense, the defendant must prove that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not discern right from wrong {{at the time of}} the crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced her to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with eligibility for parole in 40 years.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} minimalist {{approach to}} change provides for removing the sovereign and retaining the governor-general. The most notable model {{of this type}} is the McGarvie Model, while Copernican models replace the monarch with a directly-elected figurehead. These Copernican models allow for regular and periodic elections {{for the office of}} head of state while limiting the reserve powers to the appointed governor-general only. A popularly elected head of state would have the same powers as the monarch, but <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not dismiss the prime minister. If this were to happen, it would be a first, as all other former Commonwealth realms have created presidencies upon becoming republics.|$|E
25|$|Although all {{individuals}} with ORS {{believe they have}} an odor, {{in some cases the}} individual reports they cannot perceive the odor themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of the odor (i.e. anosmia) exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (olfactory hallucination). Olfactory hallucination can be considered the result of the belief in an odor delusion, or the belief a result of the olfactory hallucination. In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> detect the odor themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present.|$|E

25|$|The Blackwell Company {{also ran}} a coupon {{campaign}} that offered “free” {{goods to the}} consumers of the Bull Durham brand. Coupons were included in every pack of Bull Durham Tobacco. After a consumer had saved up a set amount of coupons <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> cash them in for an item of equivalent value. For example, for 100 coupons and one dollar one could get a gold plated watch. There were over 180 rewards each costing a different number of coupons. This advertising style was unique for its time and increased sales as people had double the incentive to buy the product. This style of advertising is still seen in companies today. The company and especially Carr used every angle of advertising they could think of {{in order to promote}} Bull Durham. These advertising techniques were completely unique for their time and many of the methods have greatly influenced modern day advertising.|$|E
500|$|From 1547, if a peer or peeress {{was convicted}} of a crime, except treason or murder, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> claim [...] "privilege of peerage" [...] to escape {{punishment}} if it was their first offence. In all, the privilege was exercised five times, until it was formally abolished in 1841 when James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he {{was convicted of}} duelling. He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{after winning}} a round, contestants spent their {{winnings}} on prizes that were presented onstage.

However, a contestant would lose any money on account by landing on Bankrupt or failing to claim it by not winning subsequent rounds. The shopping element was eliminated from the syndicated version on the episode that aired October 5, 1987, both to speed up gameplay and to alleviate the taxes paid by contestants. However, the network version continued to use the shopping element until the end of its first NBC run on June 30, 1989.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to being}} hired at Mirage, the {{producer}} had spent years {{looking for a}} suitable screenwriter – someone who was [...] "equally strong {{in the areas of}} satire and romance" [...] and could think in Austen's language [...] "almost as naturally as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think {{in the language of the}} twentieth century." [...] Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a series of comedic skits, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was [...] "exactly what [...] been searching for." [...] Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film Dead Again. A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt Sense and Sensibility, although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt Persuasion or Emma before agreeing to Doran's proposal. The actress found that Sense and Sensibility contained more action than she had remembered, and decided it would translate well to drama.|$|E
500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the defendant in an appeal of murder. If the defendant was taken in the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong evidence of guilt that there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, and if he was still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff said the word craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|E
500|$|It {{was learned}} {{that if the}} {{forklift}} were incorrectly positioned the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a see-saw and jam the pylon against the wing's attachment points. The forklift operator was guided only by hand and voice signals, as <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. [...] Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon, {{but there was a}} shift change halfway through the job. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned, resulting in unseen structural damage to the wing's pylon attachment points. The structural damage was not enough to cause an immediate failure. However, fatigue cracking developed, and worsened with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed the maintenance on N110AA. [...] Finally, the damaged rear pylon mount reached its breaking point and failed. Due to the absence of this attachment, the engine, at full takeoff power, swung itself and the pylon upward on the latter's still-attached forward mount. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount failed from the resulting stresses, and the engine/pylon assembly broke free of the wing.|$|E
