5|$|Imelda {{also managed}} to {{convince}} Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination along with presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos. She first invited Lopez to personally meet with her in his suite. Lopez accepted the invite but preferred {{to talk with her}} in her suite instead. To persuade Lopez, her methods include appealing to Lopez's sympathy by telling him the struggles that she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign for Ferdinand's nomination and how she feels being abandoned by Lopez. Lopez refused multiple times until Imelda cried in front of him. Imelda then proceeded to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> and make him sign a document stating that he accepts the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During {{the same}} year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito, {{who would be}} killed in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento {{continued}} to exercise the idea of {{freedom of the press}} and began two new periodicals entitled La Tribuna and La Crónica respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over.|$|E

5|$|The crusade {{ended with}} the catastrophic defeat of the crusaders in the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444. After the battle Hunyadi wanted to return to Hungary through Wallachia, but he was {{captured}} by Wallachian soldiers at the Danube. Vlad only released him after Lawrence Héderváry, Palatine of Hungary, threatened him with a war. According to historian John Jefferson, Vlad held Hunyadi in captivity {{because he wanted to}} <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to the sultan. Camil Mureşanu writes that Hunyadi was only imprisoned because the soldiers who captured him did not recognize him. Historian Kurt W. Teptow says, Vlad held Hunyadi responsible for the catastrophe and almost killed him. After releasing Hunyadi, Vlad gave him precious gifts and accompanied him as far as the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionaries started {{negotiations}} with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held Sun Yat-sen's power of attorney, to buy a million rifles. However, the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders. From China, Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement. However, he was forced into hiding within 48 hours {{when he came to}} know that the Japanese authorities planned to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to the British. Later reports indicated he was protected at this time by Toyama Mitsuru right-wing political leader and founder of the Genyosha nationalist secret society.|$|E
5|$|Tintin is {{captured}} by Mitsuhirato, {{who plans to}} poison him with Rajaijah; however, {{a member of the}} Sons of the Dragon swaps the poison for coloured water, and Tintin escapes unscathed. When Mitsuhirato discovers the deception, he convinces J.M. Dawson, the corrupt Chief of Police at the Shanghai International Settlement, to put a warrant out for Tintin's arrest. Meanwhile, Tintin enters the Settlement in search for Professor Fang Hsi-ying, an expert on poisons whom he hopes can develop a cure for Rajaijah, but discovers that he has been kidnapped. Dawson's police arrest Tintin and <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to the Japanese, who sentence him to death before he is rescued by Wang.|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, India's ODI team {{began to}} hit rocky waters. After losing a {{bilateral}} {{series in the}} West Indies, they were knocked out of a triangular tournament in Malaysia ahead of the finals, and were eliminated {{in the first round}} of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy on home soil. Kartik took four wickets at 34.00 and an economy rate of 5.36 in the Challenger Trophy and could not earn a recall. He had a steady domestic first-class season, taking 26 wickets at 25.53 in nine matches, never taking more than five wickets in a match. He took 13 wickets at 27.92 in eight one-day matches for the season, and was overlooked as Kumble and Harbhajan were the spinners selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. India were knocked out in the first round after losing to Bangladesh, and Harbhajan was dropped while Kumble retired from ODIs, but Kartik did not do enough to persuade the selectors to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> a recall.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E
5|$|Æthelfrith of Northumbria {{may have}} married Acha, {{who was the}} mother of his son Oswald (born in about 604), {{according}} to Bede. Æthelfrith pursued Acha's exiled brother Edwin in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged. Edwin found hospitality in the household of Cearl of Mercia and later married Cearl's daughter. Edwin's nephew Hereric, an exile in the British kingdom of Elmet, was slain there under treacherous circumstances. Edwin eventually sought the protection of Rædwald, where he was received willingly. Rædwald promised to protect him, and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions. When news of Edwin reached Æthelfrith in Northumbria, he sent messengers to Rædwald offering money in return for Edwin's death, but Rædwald refused to comply. Æthelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time, offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted. Rædwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to ambassadors.|$|E

Although Clisson survived, Charles was determined to punish the would-be assassin, Pierre de Craon, who had taken refuge in Brittany. John V, Duke of Brittany was unwilling to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over, so Charles prepared a military expedition.|$|E
25|$|Jungians have {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of parent hunger, forcing one repeatedly to seek out unactualised parts of the father archetype in the outside world. One answer men have been offered is to move into generativity; to find the lost father within themselves, the internal father, and <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> on to their successors, thereby shifting from demanding parental guidance to providing it.|$|E
25|$|Roma, {{unaware of}} Levene's fate, reveals his true {{intentions}} behind the partnership.

25|$|PP leader Alexandru Averescu {{was working}} to gather as much support as needed for {{prompting}} Carol to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> power. His plan backfired: on one hand, the Stelists {{did not necessarily}} endorse {{the idea of a}} new Averescu government; on the other, the PP moderates protested against Averescu's cohabitation with fascist groups. By early 1936, the Constitutional Front still existed, but the PP had effectively withdrawn from it.|$|E
25|$|The knight {{was usually}} {{accompanied}} by one, {{two or more}} squires, the most experienced of whom (mainly from the impoverished szlachta) had to protect their master during the battle, and to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> the most convenient weapons. Other servants had to deliver fresh horses, spears, shields, {{and take care of}} wounded men. All were armed with swords or falchions and often bows or cross bows. They all formed the smallest element in the army's structure − the kopia, or Lances fournies.|$|E
25|$|After an Interpol alert, Parmar {{was arrested}} while {{attempting}} to enter Germany. Germany chose to handle the case locally rather than <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to India. Parmar went on a hunger strike to win his religious right to wear a turban and have vegetarian meals in the Düsseldorf jail. After India received information that Parmar had made assassination threats against Indira Gandhi, they found that Germany had decided that the evidence was weak. They had expelled Parmar and released him to Canada in June 1984 after nearly a year in jail.|$|E

25|$|The king then {{continues}} clockwise, repeating the dialogue and anointment, eight times overall, until finally {{returning to the}} east. The pandit of the east will then sum up the anointment with a similar speech as above, with appropriate replies from the king. The Chief Brahmin will then approach the king and <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> the great royal nine-tiered white umbrella, the symbol of a consecrated king. The king will accept it and hand it over to a royal page. A mantra is then invoked by the Brahmin, to fanfare and music. The king will then rise from the throne and proceed to the crowning.|$|E
25|$|Carver {{visits the}} social {{services}} offices personally and tries to convince them to put Randy {{at the top of}} the list for foster placement.

At day's end Randy is still sleeping on the bench in Carver's office. The next morning Mello gives Carver an angry tirade when he discovers Randy and orders him to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to DSS. Randy offers Carver his savings to bribe someone for a foster place.|$|E
25|$|In 1804, the Turks {{extended}} {{their efforts to}} capture Zacharias {{as well as the}} former Bey of Mani, Tzanetos Grigorakis, who retreated to the mountains after being deposed and after the events of the 1803 Ottoman Invasion of Mani. The reason for this increased interest into Zacharias' capture was because it had been revealed that together with Zanet and other prominent Maniots, he had been conspiring with Napoleon Bonaparte, who had sent them French weapons. In charge of the attempt to capture Zacharias was Seremet, who had been instructed to capture Zacharias and <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to the higher authorities.|$|E
