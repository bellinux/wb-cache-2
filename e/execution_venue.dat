40|$|The new {{regulatory}} environment triggered by MiFID {{has resulted in}} a transformed competitive landscape and increased fragmentation among <b>execution</b> <b>venues</b> in Europe. One key component of MiFID is best execution, i. e. investment firms are obliged to achieve the best result for customer orders on a consistent basis. Specifically for retail transactions, the total consideration, i. e. price and explicit transaction costs, shall apply as a benchmark for the best result. In contrary to RegNMS, MiFID does not require to achieve the best result based on a real-time comparison of available prices. Therefore, after the introduction of MiFID the question on the extent of suboptimal order executions after transaction costs arises. Applying order book data for EURO STOXX 50 securities of ten European <b>execution</b> <b>venues,</b> this paper analyses suboptimal order executions including transaction costs by simulating an optimal Smart Order Routing engine. The results show that after explicit transaction costs, specifically cross-system settlement costs, still an economically relevant number of suboptimal order executions prevails.

25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010, {{and has more}} than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of <b>execution</b> <b>venues</b> has lowered transaction costs, increased market liquidity, and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} for investment firms and clients that arise out of {{an interpretation of the}} Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) best execution requirements from a law and economics perspective. While best execution is often framed as a matter of investor protection, research on market microstructure suggests that there is, in fact, an efficiency rationale (and not only a distributional rationale) for having some degree of best execution regulation. In terms of the specific rules of MiFID, the analysis reveals that an investment firm’s best execution policy will play a central role. MiFID’s best execution concept is process- based, ie investment firms need to show that they took measures leading to best execution in expectation; actual best execution is not required. The paper also discusses current issues such as the form of the execution policy and the appropriate number of <b>execution</b> <b>venues...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{discover}} performance {{persistence in}} the equity transactions of institutional investors and their brokers {{over the period}} 1999 - 2005. Brokers (institutional clients) ranked as top performers based on execution quality outperform brokers (clients) ranked as bottom performers over adjacent periods. The broker and client persistence patterns are independent and cannot be explained by client investment style or soft dollar arrangements. The best brokers tend to specialize in certain industries, charge higher commissions, more often work the order, and can consistently execute trades with no price impact. The best performing clients tend to be larger, concentrate order flow with fewer brokers, and can robustly obtain negative trading costs, suggesting that their trading desks help create positive (investment) alpha through their trading strategies. We find that the worst brokers lose market share slowly and that the worst clients tend to specify low commission <b>execution</b> <b>venues,</b> suggesting they focus on explicit costs. Our findings imply that broker selection is an important dimension of an institution’s Best Execution obligation, and that persistence in execution performance is important enough to explain {{a significant portion of}} mutual fun...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} and regulatory initiatives {{have led to}} the emergence of a competitive, but fragmented, equity trading landscape in several markets around the world. While these changes have coincided with benefits like reduced transaction costs, advancements in trading technology, and access to a diverse array of <b>execution</b> <b>venues,</b> regulators and market participants have also raised concerns about the welfare implications of innovations like dark pools as well as the resulting increase in execution complexity. Exchanges are often viewed as natural monopolies due to the presence of network externalities and economies of scale. However, heterogeneity in traders' preferences means that no single venue can serve the interests of all investors. Fragmentation of the marketplace {{can be seen as a}} direct outcome of this heterogeneity. In this article we review the theoretical and empirical literature examining the economic arguments and motivations underlying market fragmentation, the resulting implications for liquidity and price efficiency, and the role for public policy. Beyond the concerns for equity markets, the lessons from this literature are relevant for other asset classes experiencing an increase in competition between trading venues...|$|R
40|$|The {{institutional}} brokerage industry {{faces an}} ever-increasing pressure to lower trading costs, {{which has already}} driven down average commissions and shifted volume toward low-cost <b>execution</b> <b>venues.</b> However, traditional full-service brokers that bundle execution with services remain a force and their commissions are still considerably higher than the marginal cost of trade execution. We hypothesize that commissions constitute a convenient way of charging a prearranged fixed fee for long-term access to a broker’s premium services. We derive testable predictions based on this hypothesis and test them on a large sample of institutional trades from 1999 to 2003. We find that institutions negotiate commissions infrequently, and thus commissions vary little with trade characteristics. Institutions also concentrate their order flow with a relatively small set of brokers, with smaller institutions concentrating their trading more than large institutions and paying higher per-share commissions. These results are stable over time, are consistent with our predictions, and cannot be explained by cost-minimization alone. Finally, we discuss {{the evolution of the}} institutional brokerage market within the proposed framework and make informal predictions about future developments in the industry.

5000|$|The {{burning in}} 1789 of Christian Murphy, for coining, {{received}} practically no {{attention from the}} newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but {{it may have been}} enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London. [...] Hammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women. He denounced the punishment as [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] which [...] "disgraced our statutes", as [...] "the practice did the common law". He also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution. [...] William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women. Almost 140 years earlier, during the Interregnum, a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission (after its chairman Matthew Hale), was tasked by the House of Commons to take [...] "into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law". [...] Among the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament. [...] Hammett was confident though. He believed that public opinion was on his side and that [...] "the House would go with him in the cause of humanity".

40|$|The {{processing}} of data streams plays {{a central role in}} emerging applications such as pervasive computing, sensor-based environments, and on-line business processing. Such applications receive unbounded input streams that are processed against a set of standing queries. To overcome the infinite nature of data streams, the queries define windows (scopes of interest) to limit access to the unbounded input data. The window queries are repeatedly evaluated each time a new input arrives, and hence are termed sliding window queries. The straightforward application of traditional pipelined query processing techniques to sliding window queries may result in inefficient and incorrect behavior. ^ In this thesis, I address several research challenges for building a scalable query processing engine for stream database systems. I propose various scheduling techniques that guarantee the correct execution of pipelined sliding window queries. Based on the scheduling techniques, I present new algorithms for correctly evaluating complex window-based query operations. I address scalability issues through sharing the execution of multiple concurrent queries and propose new query evaluation strategies for shared execution. My research on shared <b>execution</b> opens new <b>venues</b> for optimizing multiple sliding-window queries considering the window size as an optimization parameter. I propose new algorithms to evaluate join queries over data streams using general window constraints. Since video is considered a stream of consecutive image frames, video operations may be expressed as queries over video streams. From this viewpoint I used the proposed query engine to express and execute basic video operations such as fast forward and region-based blurring as queries over video streams. ^ I have studied the performance of the proposed techniques both analytically and experimentally, using real streams of retail transactions, medical video data, and synthetic data streams, and {{in the context of a}} prototype stream database system. The performance study demonstrates the superiority and practicality of the proposed techniques in terms of response time and throughput. ...|$|R
