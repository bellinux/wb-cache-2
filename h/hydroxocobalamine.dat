40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is a review of usefulness, {{indications}} and handling of some antidotes which are at our disposal for therapeutic use since several years, especially naloxone, flumazenil, Fab fragments of digoxin specific antibodies, <b>hydroxocobalamine,</b> 4 -methyl-pyrazole, N-acetylcystein or the new metal chelators. Older clinically relevant substances are also reviewed. Journal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Case report: A 53 -year old {{pharmacist}} {{is admitted}} to hospital after poisoning with a magistral formulation containing mercuric oxycyanide. The initial treatment {{consists of the}} administration of <b>hydroxocobalamine</b> and dimercaprol (BAL), followed by a blood purifying treatment, hemodialysis, then dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and hemoperfusion. Material and methods: Mercury is quantified using cold vapor - atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) in blood and ICP-MS in urine. The mercury concentrations, determined in blood and urine 24 hours after ingestion were respectively 3087 $mu$g/L (reference value < 5 $mu$g/L) and 9573 $mu$g/g creatinin (reference value < 3 $mu$g/g). Mercury was quantified in blood and urine during 52 days of hospitalisation to follow its excretion and treatments efficiency. A mercury quantification is carried out using ICP-MS on two locks of hair collected two months after ingestion. Hair specimen (6 cm) was cut into six equal lengths. Results and discussion: Mercury concentrations range from 4. 6 to 41. 2 ng/mg (reference value < 1 ng/mg). These high concentrations {{could be explained by}} a contamination of the hair by sebum...|$|E
40|$|The {{stones and}} seeds of some {{plants such as}} apples, apricots, and peaches contain {{significant}} amounts of cyanide glycosides. Apricot pits are more toxic as they contain higher amounts of cyanogens and release hydrogen cyanide more easily. A previously healthy 27 -month old male patient was admitted to our emergency department as intubated. His history revealed that he was intubated in the hospital where {{he was taken to}} with the complaint of fainting after having eaten numerous apricot pits with other family members. His general status was poor and he was unconscious. Both of his pupils were reactive. His deep tendon reflexes were increased and his plantar reflex was extensor bilaterally. The case was diagnosed as cyanide intoxication and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Oxygen was constinuosly given under observation. After administration of <b>hydroxocobalamine</b> and sodium bicarbonate and correction of sodium deficit the patient regained consciousness and his general health improved. On the second day of admittance, he was discharged with a stable condition. This case was presented to emphasize that parents should not feed small children with apricot pits.

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{designed}} to examine the differential effect of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP on glutamate neurotransmission. In primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells, the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimulates the elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i), the release of glutamate, the synthesis of NO and an increase of cGMP. Although NO {{has been shown to}} stimulate guanylyl cyclase, it is unclear yet whether NO alters the NMDA-induced glutamate release and [Ca 2 +]i elevation. We showed that the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), partially prevented the NMDA-induced release of glutamate and elevation of [Ca 2 +]i and completely blocked the elevation of cGMP. These effects of NO on glutamate release and [Ca 2 +]i elevation were unlikely to be secondary to cGMP as the cGMP analogue, dibutyryl cGMP (dBcGMP), did not suppress the effects of NMDA. Rather, dBcGMP slightly augmented the NMDA-induced elevation of [Ca 2 +]i with no change in the basal level of glutamate or [Ca 2 +]i. The extracellular NO scavenger <b>hydroxocobalamine</b> prevented the NMDA-induced release of glutamate providing indirect evidence that the effect of NO may act on the NMDA receptor. These results suggest that low concentration of NO has a role in maintaining the NMDA receptor activation in a cGMP-independent manner. ope...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{and local}} effect: Smoke {{inhalation}} causes systemic and local, mainly respiratory, toxicity {{due to the}} asphyxiant and irritant properties of toxic gases. Oxygen deprivation and intoxication: The syndrome of oxygen deprivation and intoxication by asphyxiant gases is caused by combustion-induced oxygen deprivation and exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN), but also to other toxic gases. A loss of consciousness {{is a good sign}} of systemic toxicity; however, the respective role of CO, CN and other toxic gases cannot be determined. The presence of apnea, lactic acidosis, and severe cardiovascular disturbances is consistent with CN poisoning. A correlation exists between blood CO concentration determined on a sample obtained {{at the site of the}} fire, and the occurrence and severity of the clinical disorders. Irritant gases intoxication: This syndrome explains the mucosal injury affecting the eyes and the lungs. These complications are better diagnosed by clinical examination rather than by various investigations such as chest X-ray of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Dysphonia is always a sign of severe poisoning. Clinical course: In non-burned victims, delayed neurological and respiratory complications can be observed. Oxygen administration is the cornerstone supportive therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen should be discussed according to the severity of the syndrome of oxygen deprivation and intoxication by asphyxiant gases. In case of cyanide poisoning, a safe and effective antidote should be given; <b>hydroxocobalamine</b> seems to be the drug of choice. Supportive treatment is efficient to treat respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation should be considered in patients exhibiting early dysphonia associated with dyspnea...|$|E
