50|$|The Defence of India Act 1915, also {{referred}} to as the Defence of India Regulations Act, was an <b>emergency</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> enacted by the Governor-General of India in 1915 with the intention of curtailing the nationalist and revolutionary activities during and {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War. It was similar to the British Defence of the Realm Acts, and granted the Executive very wide powers of preventive detention, internment without trial, restriction of writing, speech, and of movement. However, unlike the English law which was limited to persons of hostile associations or origin, the Defence of India act could be applied to any subject of the King, and was used to an overwhelming extent against Indians.The passage of the act was supported unanimously by the non-official Indian members in the Viceroy's legislative council, and was seen as necessary to protect against British India from subversive nationalist violence. The act was first applied during the First Lahore Conspiracy trial in the aftermath of the failed Ghadar Conspiracy of 1915, and was instrumental in crushing the Ghadr movement in Punjab and the Anushilan Samiti in Bengal. However its widespread and indiscriminate use in stifling genuine political discourse made it deeply unpopular, and became increasingly reviled within India. The extension of the law in the form of the Rowlatt Act after the end of World War I was opposed unanimously by the non-official Indian members of the Viceroy's council. It became a flashpoint of political discontent and nationalist agitation, culminating in the Rowlatt Satyagraha. The act was re-enacted during World War II as Defence of India act 1939. Independent India retained the law in a number of amended forms, which have seen use in proclaimed states of national emergency including Sino-Indian War, Bangladesh crisis, The Emergency of 1975 and subsequently the Punjab insurgency.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the draft}} of a paper {{initially}} presented in the Oxford Jurisprudence Discussion Group. The paper assesses the relationship between individual <b>emergencies</b> and <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> {{in light of the}} ideal {{of the rule of law}} and Joseph Raz 2 ̆ 7 s thesis about the normal justification of authority. After sketching out the main theoretical positions on how <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> ought to provide for its own potential failure in the face of private emergencies, I argue that it is only in the most extreme and generalized cases that its sole legitimate response is to disclaim all competence in favour of its subjects. Whereas, in other cases (the focus of the paper), the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> may not be able to provide legitimate ex ante guidance, it may still be able to preserve the legitimacy of its authority. It may do so by granting some practical latitude to its subjects confronted with individual emergencies to act in accordance with morality, and by vindicating their correct responses ex post facto. The argument rests on the premise, which I defend, that morality never lapses even in the face of emergencies and that, therefore, the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> can always expect its subjects to abide by it. I then go on to contrast justification and excusatory defences as means of providing moral latitude to individuals facing emergencies, and conclude by refuting the assumption that people typically act irrationally when confronted with emergencies...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{article is}} an {{overview}} of developments in substantive <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> in Nigeria in the last 53 years. It examines the sharing of constitutional legislative powers to enact <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> between the federal (national) government and the state (local) governments. The examination of federal laws revealed proactive legislative activity responding to emerging local and international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> issues. The main development {{at the state level}} is the introduction by States in Northern Nigeria of Sharia Penal Codes and the enactment of the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> of Lagos State 2011. A common trend is the entrenchment of death penalty as punishment for some crimes. Implications: While federal <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> have responded to emerging realties, state <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> have generally failed to respond to emerging issues at the state level. Consequently, in most of the southern states <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> introduced in 1916 have continued to apply. Value: The paper demonstrates the need for southern States to reform their <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> to respond to emerging realties, the federal government to respond to some outstanding <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> issues and calls for a suspension of death penalty and a revaluation of its continued relevance...|$|R
