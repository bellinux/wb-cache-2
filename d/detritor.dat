Method used in this research was eksploratif, by exploitedly source of data exist in nature. Determination of sample location, that was with Purposive Sampling technique, because condition and population of heterogeneous sample. Technique intake of sampel systematicly, at location of house lawn, divisible wayside and garden in 10 station locations. At every location of intake of sample made by 4 plot. Density of highest ant Selonopsis sp was 30 body/m 2 in the Lunjuk jaya and the lowest was 0, 5 body/m 2 in the Mess Unsri. Density of highest ant Dolichoderus sp was 61 body/m 2 in the Taman Bukit Siguntang, while the lowest was 3, 25 body/m 2 in the Lunjuk Jaya and the Puncak Sekuning. Density of highest ant Ponera sp was 0, 5 body/m 2 in station of the Taman Bukit and the lowest was 0, 25 body/m 2 in the Kampus Unsri Bukit Besar. Pattern of Distribution of Selonopsis sp, Dolichoderus sp and Ponera sp is group. Selonopsis sp of personating <b>detritor,</b> predator and have symbiosis of mutualisme with plantlice, Dolichoderus sp of personating of <b>detritor</b> and predator and also Ponera sp of personating predator.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{fine grinding}} {{machines in the}} minerals industry are stirred mills whose performance largely depends on the competency of the grinding medium. Medium wear in stirred mills {{is one of the}} key parameters for medium selection. A wear evaluation methodology is developed and applied in this paper to measure the wear rate of river sand using a laboratory batch stirred mill. The procedure is demonstrated by testing the sand medium in a 0. 55 kW batch stirred media <b>detritor</b> (SMD). The sand wear rate determined in the laboratory batch mill is successfully scaled up to that determined on a full-scale Metso 355 kW SMD mill...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the surface}} {{properties}} of minerals with grinding and regrinding {{play a key role}} in mineral flotation performance, being recognised in industry through the development of the IsaMill and Stirred Mill <b>Detritor.</b> This paper describes some initial results in a larger study which attempts to quantify changes in the flotation properties of sulphide minerals with regrinding using different mills. Pyrrhotite has been chosen in the current study due its importance in the recovery of Platinum Group Minerals and in its separation from pentlandite in Sudbury basin nickel ores. This current paper focuses on the results obtained using a Magotteaux Mill only. Factors which affected pyrrhotite flotation were particle size, grinding media contamination, and exposure of new mineral surface. Pyrrhotite recovery decreased with size reduction from 90 %, achieved before regrinding, to 77 %, 64 %, 30 % and 7 % after regrinding with stainless steel medium to d{ 80 } values of 60, 40, 20 and 10 m, respectively. Contact angle measurements were applied to quantify surface hydrophobicity as a function of particle size and the B. E. T. method was used to obta{{in the surface}} area. Increased collector addition only partially restored pyrrhotite recovery. The surface of the pyrrhotite mineral was changed by regrinding in a way that hindered collector adsorption onto the new mineral surface. A further dramatic depression of pyrrhotite recovery when using mild steel regrinding medium demonstrated that there was an additional contribution to pyrrhotite depression from media contamination in this case.

40|$|The final degree {{project for}} a Bachelor of Science in Mining and Mineral Engineering {{has been carried}} out at Boliden Mineral AB between April and June 2013. The report {{describes}} the history and geology of the mines of Boliden, origin and the development of one of the largest metal-mining companies in Europe - Boliden Mineral AB. In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. The objective of this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for the improvement of the regrinding in the ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and the segregation of the fractions in the silos. It is proposed to install a cone {{on the top of the}} silos to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a mobile conveyor on the way to the silos and to the ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. The main task of the thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of regrinding effects on the results of flotation. The analysis of the sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden. The analytical equipment such as X-rays and ICP were used for metal analysis and QEMSCAN was used for mineralogical determinations analyses. Theoretical calculations and results of conducted laboratory experiments suggests that regrinding in the ball mill has a positive effect on the flotation process, but some improvement is required, especially the regrinding of the gangue particles. This process helps to liberate all metal particles and improves results of metal recovery. For improvement of regrinding process, it is proposed to replace the regrinding ball mill with a newer, more efficient mill of SMD type (Stirred Media <b>Detritor).</b> Validerat; 20131218 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
