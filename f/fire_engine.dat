5|$|Other {{advantages}} of using an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> were {{that it would}} not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did. Also, the cost of an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> would be about one-third that of a steam boiler <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> A typical electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Electric <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Company of Seneca Falls, New York, {{was formed}} on June 25, 1890, to {{manufacture}} the <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> apparatus and associated equipment. The Electric <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Company of America was formed December 1899 in Des Moines, Iowa. It was to manufacture self-propelled automobile electric fire engines and general equipment for fire departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{would have}} several advantages over the steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> One {{was that an}} electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were {{assigned}} to the <b>fire.</b> Structural <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were used in building complexes, where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings. Smaller wildland <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout the park.|$|R
25|$|For {{many years}} firefighters {{sat on the}} sides of the <b>fire</b> <b>engines,</b> or even stood on the rear of the vehicles, exposed to the elements. This {{arrangement}} was uncomfortable and dangerous (some firefighters were thrown to their deaths when their <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> made sharp turns on the road), and today nearly all <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> have fully enclosed seating areas for their crews.|$|R
5000|$|While in port, Swift {{received}} 140 Project Handclasp pallets and two <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b> The Wisconsin National Guard State Partnership Program {{donated the}} <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> to Project Handclasp for transportation to Nicaragua, their partner nation.|$|R
5|$|There were various {{experimental}} illustrations showing what {{an electrical}} <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{could do better}} than a steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> if the complete system was put into operation. One set up demonstration was at the Crystal palace electrical exhibition of 1892.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> in 1899. The French electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine,</b> known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{would be}} efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Several {{second-hand}} Pierce-Arrow {{cars were}} bought by fire departments, stripped {{down to the}} chassis and engine, the wheelbase lengthened, and built back into <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b> Some of these <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were in service for up to 20 years.|$|R
50|$|Lysander Button (September 2, 1810 - July 29, 1898) was the {{inventor}} {{of many of the}} early improvements made on hand and steam <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b> Many of those improvements {{made their way to the}} modern <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> of today.|$|R

5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> of the same capacity as a steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
5000|$|The Gramm/Ahrens-Fox <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> had Hercules {{motors and}} either Nortrhern or Hale fire pumps, while the Gramm/Bickles used Seagrave motors and pumps. Bickle also made <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> on Seagrave's own chassis, and on various other {{commercial}} truck chassis, {{at the same}} time that they were making Gramm/Bickles.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> arrived {{eight minutes}} after the fire alarm went off. However, it took nearly two hours for the firefighters to reach the fire itself. The fire was {{initially}} tackled by the Ninth Fire Company that was joined by the crews of seven other <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the <b>Fire</b> <b>Engines</b> {{reformed}} {{to support}} The Magic Band at The Liquid Room in Edinburgh, and released a limited edition collaboration single with Franz Ferdinand; The seven-inch single contained a Franz Ferdinand {{cover of the}} <b>Fire</b> <b>Engines</b> song [...] "Get Up and Use Me" [...] with <b>Fire</b> <b>Engines</b> covering Franz Ferdinand's [...] "Jacqueline". The band continued to play occasional concerts until 2006. On 2 October 2007, the Acute label issued Hungry Beat, a collection of the band's original studio recordings, making them available {{for the first time}} on CD in the US.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Sachs {{had also}} invented an {{electric}} <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> vehicle {{consisting of a}} wagon on which a spring-supported platform held an electric motor which operated two rotary water pumps.

5|$|On 13 April 1845, fire {{destroyed}} much of London, {{which was}} at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings. One of the first casualties was the town's only <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself out later the same day. One-fifth of London was destroyed and this was the province's first million dollar fire.|$|E

5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> was proposed to replace the steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> in use at the time. It was to be constructed {{in such a way}} that it would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E
5|$|Eccles {{became the}} first {{municipal}} corporation in England to operate a motorised <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> in 1901. It was supplied to Eccles Corporation by a local firm, the Protector Lamp and Lighting Co., also known for manufacturing Miners' Safety Lamps. Barton Aerodrome, the first municipal aerodrome in the UK to be licensed by the Air Ministry, was opened on 29 January 1930 on a site at Barton-on-the-Moss.|$|E
5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States. Several French {{landmarks}} such as the Eiffel Tower, its Jules Verne Restaurant and the Château de Chantilly were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at Fisherman's Wharf, Dunsmuir House, San Francisco City Hall and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The Lefty O'Doul Bridge was featured in the <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> chase scene. The horse racing scenes were shot at Ascot Racecourse.|$|E
