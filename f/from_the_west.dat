5|$|On 1 August 1870, the DR opened {{additional}} tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington. On 10 July 1871, the DR {{opened its}} own facilities at South Kensington. The enlarged station had two through platforms for each {{company and a}} bay platform for terminating MR trains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> The junction between the two companies' tracks was also moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> side of the station to the east side.|$|E
5|$|A {{second letter}} arrived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> this time {{addressed}} to Cope. The writer, O. W. Lucas, was a naturalist {{who had been}} collecting plants near Cañon City, Colorado when he came upon an assortment of fossil bones. After receiving more samples from Lucas, Cope concluded the dinosaurs were large herbivores, gleefully noting that the specimen was larger than any other previously described, including Lakes' discovery. Hearing of Lucas' finds, Marsh instructed Mudge and a former student, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to set up a}} quarry on his behalf near Cañon. Unfortunately for Marsh, he learned from Williston that Lucas was finding the best bones and refused to quit Cope to come work for Marsh. Marsh ordered Williston back to Morrison, where Marsh's small quarry collapsed and nearly killed his assistants. This setback would have dried up Marsh's bone supply <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> if not for receipt of a third letter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaties of Versailles brought an end to the Anglo-French War, Agamemnon {{returned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies to Chatham, where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced. She came out of dock on 4 June 1784, and was subsequently laid up in ordinary.|$|E
25|$|Magpies Chairman Kevin Hammond was {{disappointed}} at <b>the</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers decision and informed <b>the</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers {{of that in}} 2008, if the Magpies did not receive {{a fair share of}} player allocation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers, they would form a feeder partnership with rivals Canberra Raiders. <b>The</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers capitulated.|$|R

5|$|Brighton Forum {{is built}} on a high, {{prominent}} corner position, giving it good visibility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and south and long southward views. Knapped flint is the main building material, augmented by stone dressings and some yellow brickwork to the quoins. The roof is laid with tiles.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E

5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering {{equipment for the}} river crossings inhibited a flanking attack of Warsaw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck.

The Arram Beck flows in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge.
