40|$|Safety {{and cost}} {{information}} is {{developed for the}} conceptual decommissioning of large (1175 -MWe) pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and large (1155 -MWe) boiling water reactors {BWRs) at multiple-reactor stations. Three decommissioning alternatives are studied: DECON (immediate decontamination), SAFSTOR (safe storage followed by deferred decontamination), and ENTOMB (entombment). Safety and costs of decommissioning are estimated by determining the impact of probable features of multiple-reactor-station operation that {{are considered to be}} unavailable at a single-reactor station, and applying these estimated impacts to the decommissioning costs and radiation doses estimated in previous PWR and BWR decommissioning studies. The multiple-reactor-station features analyzed are: the use of interim onsite nuclear waste storage with later removal to an offsite nuclear waste disposal facility, the use of permanent onsite nuclear waste disposal, the dedication of the site to nuclear power generation, and the provision of centralized services. Five scenarios for <b>decommissioning</b> reactors at <b>a</b> multiple-reactor station are investigated. The number of reactors on a site is assumed to be either four or ten; nuclear waste disposal is varied between immediate offsite disposal, interim onsite storage, and immediate onsite disposal. It is assumed that the decommissioned reactors are not replaced in one scenario but are replaced in the other scenarios. Centralized service facilities are provided in two scenarios but are not provided in the other three. <b>Decommissioning</b> of <b>a</b> PWR or a BWR at a multiple-reactor station probably will be less costly and result in lower radiation doses than <b>decommissioning</b> <b>an</b> identical reactor at a single-reactor station. Regardless of whether the light water reactor being decommissioned is at a single- or multiple-reactor station: • the estimated occupational radiation dose for <b>decommissioning</b> <b>an</b> LWR is lowest for SAFSTOR and highest for DECON • the estimated cost of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>a</b> PWR is lowest for ENTOMB and highest for SAFSTOR • the estimated cost of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>a</b> BWR is lowest for OECON and highest for SAFSTOR. In all cases, SAFSTOR has the lowest occupational radiation dose and the highest cost...|$|R
