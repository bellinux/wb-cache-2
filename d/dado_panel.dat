5000|$|The village pub is the New Inn. An {{historic}} pub {{interior of}} [...] "national importance" [...] Listed Status: Grade II. This red-brick hotel-cum-pub built in 1885 for the South Down & East Grinstead Brewery retains its plan-form and fittings virtually intact at present. The central entrance has 'Hotel Entrance' etched {{glass in the}} doors {{and to the right}} are a pair of doors leading to the public bar with one remaining 'Public Bar' etched panel. To be noted is the ceramic button with the figure '1' above the inside of the front doors - a requirement of licensing magistrates. The pub part is small with a long public bar fronting the main street (there was probably a screen dividing it originally) and one small room behind. The spartan public bar fittings are much as they were in Victorian times with a wood-block floor, a long Victorian counter with the front painted cream, bar back fitting with three large cash drawers (note two slots for notes) and four ceramic spirit barrels (note ‘I Whisky’ from the days before the fad of inserting an ‘e’ to distinguish the Irish from the Scottish variety). There are two sections of wall bench seating attached to matchboard dado panelling and a small early 20th century tiled fireplace with decoration on the wood surround and with a log fire. To be noted is the hatch on the left of the servery for customers of the hotel and waiters who would have served the former restaurant. At the rear right is the snug, a small room which now has a carpet and is home to a bar billiards table, The matchboard <b>dado</b> <b>panels</b> have been painted white and service is via the original split doors with a hatch/shelf {{to the back of the}} bar.

50|$|Four Mile Tree's oldest {{interior}} woodwork is in {{the central}} stairhall where the turned balustrading on the stair, the heavy hand rail and the high dado place the date {{in the first half}} of the eighteenth century. The southwest room, which probably dates from the early nineteenth century, has two framed niches flanking a simple mantel and overmantel topped by an architrave, frieze and cornice; only the cornice and a <b>paneled</b> <b>dado</b> ornament the other walls of the room. The remaining rooms have mantels which seem to date from the first half of the nineteenth century but only in the southeastern room is there a paneled room.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the timber}} floors were predominately covered with carpet with the {{exception}} of the amenities areas. This was removed in 2010 and the original hoop-pine timber floors were polished and restored.
