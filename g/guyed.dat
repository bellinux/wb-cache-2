25|$|Ultimately, {{the site}} chosen {{for both the}} {{transmitter}} and the studio was Black Mountain, approximately 5km west of the city centre at 812 m above sea level. Extensive tests from the site proved {{that it was the}} ideal location for the transmitter, with signals adequately covering the Canberra area. The ABC also decided to place their transmitter atop Black Mountain— both would be perched atop <b>guyed</b> masts (as opposed to towers) with each rising to 126 metres and 152 metres, respectively. ABC's studio would be located in Canberra city proper. In order to access the transmitters and studio, a road needed to be built up to the summit— construction commenced in July 1961. CTL were granted the lease to the Black Mountain site on 26 September 1961.|$|E

500|$|Getzein's {{record for}} {{complete}} games {{is based in}} part on the customs of the 1880s. [...] In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era.

In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd <b>guyed</b> Getzein terribly.

500|$|Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not {{everyone}} {{was of the}} same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, {{which was part of}} her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe [...] "all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery - adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenalia also included a heroine who <b>guyed</b> Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being “in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another”. As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming “Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude”.|$|E
