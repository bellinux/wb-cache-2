Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E

It is funded by the Irish Government's Health Service Executive and provides specialist care in ophthalmology and ear, nose and throat disease.|$|R
40|$|Eye–hand {{coordination}} {{was investigated}} {{with the global}} effect paradigm. In this paradigm, saccades typically land in between the target and a nearby presented distractor, the configuration’s center of gravity. This so-called global effect, or spatial averaging, is attributed to incomplete target selection. Four experiments demonstrated a similar effect for hand movements; thus, <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand are coupled during target selection. However, under some conditions the global effect was different for <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand, suggesting that their coupling is not achieved through a shared target representation. Instead, <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand seem to use 2 separate target representations that exchange information. The convergent amplitudes of <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand with simultaneous execution support this interpretation. Latencies showed a similar converging pattern. A great number of daily activities require the coordinated action of <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand. Whether reaching for a coffee cup or playing tennis, {{it is necessary to}} couple motor information with visual information for these actions to be successful. Because the hand motor system relies on visual information, {{it seems likely that the}} motor systems of <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand are closely coupled. Coupling can be studied with respect to the time of movement initiation and the representation of target position of both <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand. It is generally assumed that the information used for movement initiation differs for <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand movements (e. g., Gielen, van den Heuvel, & van Gisbergen, 1984), at least in the case of reactive movements (Sailer, Eggert, Ditterich, & Straube, 2000). This as-sumption is supported by the rather weak correlations found be-tween <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> hand movement latencies toward visual target...|$|R
