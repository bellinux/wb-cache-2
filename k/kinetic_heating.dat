The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium. Titanium is quite rigid and difficult to machine, which {{made it difficult to}} form into curves given available techniques. This made the construction of the leading edges of the wing and similar surfaces difficult to form. The solution was found by machining only small [...] "fillets" [...] of the material with the required shape and then glueing them onto the underlying framework which was more linear. A good example is on the wing; the underlying framework of spars and stringers formed a grid, leaving triangular notches along the leading edge that were filled with fillets.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{designs for}} the first {{autonomous}} DNA nanomechanical devices that execute cycles of motion without external environmental changes. These DNA devices translate along a circular strand of ssDNA and rotate simultaneously. The designs use various energy sources to fuel the movements, include (i) ATP consumption by DNA ligase in conjunction with restriction enzyme operations, (ii) DNA hybridization energy in trapped states, and (iii) <b>kinetic</b> (<b>heat)</b> energy. We show {{that each of these}} energy sources can be used to fuel random bidirectional movements that acquire after n steps an expected translational deviation of O(# n). For the devices using the first two fuel sources, the rate of stepping is accelerated over the rate of random drift due to <b>kinetic</b> (<b>heat)</b> energy. Our first DNA device, which we call walking DNA, achieves random bidirectional motion around a circular ssDNA strand by use of DNA ligase and two restriction enzymes. Our other DNA device, which we call rolling DNA, achieves random bidirectional motion without use of DNA ligase or any restriction enzyme, and instead using hybridization energy. We also describe how to modify the design for the rolling DNA device to include a "latching mechanism" that fixes the wheels position at specified location along the road, so as to provide for overall unidirectional translational movement...|$|R

As the 730 was expected to operate at high speeds for extended periods of time, more data was needed on high speed operations, leading to Operational Requirement ER.134T for a testbed capable of speeds greater than Mach 2. The aircraft was expected to run at these speeds for extended periods of time, allowing it to study <b>kinetic</b> <b>heating</b> effects on such an aircraft.

50|$|The {{wings and}} {{airframe}} of the MiG-31 {{are stronger than}} those of the MiG-25, permitting supersonic flight at low altitudes. Like the MiG-25, its flight surfaces are built primarily of nickel-steel alloy, enabling the aircraft to tolerate <b>kinetic</b> <b>heating</b> at airspeeds approaching Mach 3. The MiG-31 airframe comprises 49% arc-welded nickel steel, 33% light metal alloy, 16% titanium and 2% composites. Its D30-F6 jet engines, each rated at 152 kN thrust, allow a maximum speed of Mach 1.23 at low altitude. High-altitude speed is temperature-redlined to Mach 2.83 - the thrust-to-drag ratio is sufficient for speeds in excess of Mach 3, but such speeds pose unacceptable hazards to engine and airframe life in routine use.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{minimize}} thermal stress {{is to maintain}} temperature and pressure in the cockpit within acceptable ranges, using a cockpit temperature management system. However, one problem with this system is that it works by measuring the dry bulb temperature of surrounding air without taking radiant temperature and humidity into account. Radiant heat rises when operating at low altitudes because of the greenhouse effect and <b>kinetic</b> <b>heating</b> {{on the surface of}} the aircraft. Furthermore, if cockpit temperature exceeds skin temperature, which is 33 degrees Celsius, the pilot will sweat, leading to increased humidity as the sweat evaporates. Today, the Air Force uses a more advanced air-cooling system that assesses pilots' mean skin temperature and wet bulb globe temperature. By directly measuring pilots' condition in the cockpit, the new system minimizes thermal stress and supports performance quality.|$|E

The {{results of the investigation}} of mass loss <b>kinetic</b> and <b>heat</b> flows of waste tyre pyrolysis were applied to aid the design of waste tyre pyrolysis process.

40|$|Summary. Tile kinetic {{temperature}} of {{a section of}} a propeller blade has been calculated for a blade with high thermal conductivity, and also for a blade which is non-conducting. -Calculations have been made for clear air, and for conditions of icing to find {{the extent to which}} <b>kinetic</b> <b>heating</b> is effective against ice. On a non-conducting blade the temperature is lowest at the position, on the cambered face, where the velocity of the air is greatest. At this position there is practically no protection from <b>kinetic</b> <b>heating.</b> In. the case of a blade which is a good conductor, the average temperature is calculated by balancing the flow of heat b ~ convection to and from the blade.

It was found that ion heating does not have much effect on the escape of H(+) ions because of the limiting nature of the H(+) escape fluxes.
