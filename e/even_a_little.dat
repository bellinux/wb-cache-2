5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds {{the most fun}} in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E

25|$|Using {{a normal}} {{distribution}} one can estimate the return period of 1950-level annual rainfall for the Dubbo region as around 375 years, or {{about three times}} the length of instrumental rainfall data. For areas <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further west, however, the skewness is too high to use this method, but {{there can be little}} doubt that the return periods are similar. Excluding records post-1968, when enhanced greenhouse gases has undoubtedly impacted Australian rainfall beyond (admittedly generally high) natural variability, there are no other totals over a substantial area that compare for improbability of being repeated.|$|E
25|$|October and November are {{generally}} the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cold and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than {{other parts of}} Korea except Jeju-do and several islands off the southern coast.

Snow falls on an average of only about 5 days per year. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> accumulation of snow can effectively shut down this seaport city because of the hilly terrain and unfamiliarity of motorists with driving on snow.|$|E

25|$|While Cambridge {{began writing}} in the 1870s to make money to help support her children, her formal {{published}} career spans from 1865 with Hymns on the Litany and The Two Surplices, to 1922 with an article 'Nightfall' in Atlantic Monthly. According to Barton, her early works 'contain the seeds of her lifelong insistence on and pursuit of physical, spiritual and moral integrity {{as well as the}} interweaving of poetry and prose which was to typify her writing career'. Cato writes that 'some of her ideas were considered daring and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> improper for a clergyman's wife.

25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E

500|$|... "Callin' In Sick" [...] is a style {{parody of}} music popular in Seattle, Washington, most notably grunge. [...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is {{a little bit harder}} I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} remix of [...] "Blow" [...] featuring Pharrell Williams {{was included}} on Beyoncé: Platinum Edition (2014). Mike Wass from Idolator noted how {{the song was}} [...] "borderline unlistenable" [...] and the newly-added line, [...] "I'm a milkman at your door" [...] a contender for [...] "worst lyric/euphemism of 2014". Allan Raible, an ABC News writer, deemed it redundant due to the minimal new addition to the original version. Lindsay Zoladz from the Vulture, panned the [...] "inexplicable" [...] remix as [...] "a poorly assembled cut-and-paste job", further criticizing Williams's vocals as [...] "awkward, labored, and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> off-key". Critic Robert Christgau, writing for Cuepoint, was more positive towards the remix, deeming it [...] "cuter".|$|E

[...] Sam Beresky of the Daily Lobo, who was less enthusiastic about the album, complimented Maroon 5 on [...] "Harder to Breathe", in which he said, [...] "The song is enjoyable. There are some aspects of mellow, soulful rockers like Train, John Mayer— maybe <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Stevie Wonder or Jamiroquai. The track has a good rock meets R sound and is predictable enough to get radio play." ...|$|E

[...] This, coupled with the realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year. He hitchhiked from Denver, Colorado to Berkeley, California in 1984, across [...] "a thousand miles of desert and mountains through Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, with about 40 dollars in my pocket," [...] describing it as [...] "one of the stupidest and most memorable things I've ever done." ...|$|E

While staging the concerts Harrison had made a point of distancing himself from the politics behind the war in what was formerly known as East Pakistan, and he similarly advocated peace activist Swami Vishnudevananda's proposal for Planet Earth passports – whereby [...] " [...] underlies all nations, all cultures, all colours, all races, all religions".

[...] He consequently graded the episode an A−, further attributing the success of the episode to [...] "top-tier" [...] writers Orci and Whedon and [...] "skilled" [...] director Brad Anderson. Murray wrote, [...] "I wouldn't say that 'The Transformation' broke any new ground. If anything, it recapitulated pretty much every previous Fringe element—bio-weapons sales, telepathic communication, Massive Dynamics, [...] airplane crashes, etc.—but did so {{in a way that was}} energetic, tense, and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> emotional." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall had difficulty [...] "suspend disbelief" [...] with the science behind Bowman's rapid transformation. Though she {{thought it was}} [...] "sweet" [...] that Scott's proposal [...] "echo the real-life recent marriage between Anna Torv and Mark Valley," [...] Stegall was pleased that the series could now move onto another storyline.|$|E
500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E

A spirit of good will prevails." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series [...] "just as dull as it sounds," [...] and arguing that [...] "weariness" [...] could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, [...] "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show." [...] Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013; network chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, [...] "We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV’s skyrocketing growth." ...|$|E
