[...] In the first step, a cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) catalysed oxidation produces several products including (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-epoxide. [...] The enzyme epoxide hydrolase, then hydrates the epoxide ring to yield the vicinal diol (...) -benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, which is then oxidised by cytochrome P450 oxidase again forming the mutagen and carcinogen (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. [...] This diol epoxide covalently binds to DNA by a ring-opening to alkylate the nucleobase forming a distorted structure, as shown at right, with intercalation of a pyrene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moiety between the base pairs favouring π-stacking; these distortions have been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies. [...] Aflatoxin has a similar mechanism of action, though its binding is through the N7, rather than the N2, position of guanine. [...] Multiple stereochemical outcomes are possible from these transformations.

The presence {{and quantity of}} <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> in the natural rubber molecules were analysed using infrared spectroscopy. The characteristic peaks of <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> at the wave numbers 870 and 1140 cm - 1 were observed. The quantities of <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> were found to depend on reaction temperature and reaction time.

The Tg increased with increasing level of <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> in the natural rubber molecules in a linear manner. Mooney viscosity increased with increasing the level of <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups.</b> Furthermore, shear stress and shear viscosity increased with increasing epoxide content in NR molecules. Pseudoplastic behaviour was observed for the flow of ENR melt at 100 o C. That is, shear viscosities decreased with increasing shear rates (shear-thinning behaviour). Thai corresponds to the power-law equation, where the power law index (n) of ENR was in the range of 0. 20 to 0. 31. Therefore, plug-like flow profiles obviously occurred. The power law index (n) decreased with increasing epoxide content. However, the consistency index (K) increased with increasing the quantities of epoxide on the NR molecoules...|$|R

The reaction systems involving carbon dioxide additionally were catalyzed by tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB). The dynamics of the molecular groups were studied by taking into account known reaction mechanisms to investigate whether the optimal reaction conditions were observed. Radial distribution functions and self-diffusion coefficients were calculated and revealed that in case of the systems with cycloaliphatic <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> as reagent the CO 2 molecules were located far away from the agglomerate formed by the dispersed tetraethylammonium bromide catalyst and <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> (EC), and they do not present enough mobility to overcome the long distances to react.

30|$|For the {{reaction}} step II to take place, the CO 2 molecules {{will have to}} approach considerably to the <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups.</b> As the results displayed in Figure  5 indicate, {{this seems to be}} much more difficult {{in the case of the}} CS 2 -EC than in case of CS 1 -EB. In the system CS 2 -EC the catalyst and the <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> cluster together, and CO 2 molecules result to be excluded from these aggregates, far away from the aspired reaction sites. The access for CO 2 molecules by transport through the clusters formed by the <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> and catalyst results to be limited.

50|$|Juvenile hormone's {{activity}} is destroyed by two enzymes. JH esterase cleaves the methyl ester giving JH acid.

In the Lepidoptera, the order is as given here; ester cleavage preceding epoxide hydration. Either one terminates the activity of the hormone.

50|$|These transformations set {{the stage}} for the {{introduction}} of both epoxide groups, which were formed with high levels of diastereoselectivity based on the principles of macrocyclic stereocontrol. The first epoxide was introduced via nucleophilic epoxidation of the enone using potassium hydride and tert-butylhydroperoxide; this led to the formation of a 4:1 mixture of diastereomeric epoxides, favoring the desired isomer in which attack had occurred from the peripheral face of the enone. At this stage, the ketone was transformed into the second <b>epoxide</b> <b>group</b> using the Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky reaction; notably, the product was formed as a single diastereomer, again due to initial peripheral attack of the dimethylsulfonium methylide nucleophile on the ketone. Subsequent removal of the TBS protecting group and Sarett oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohol completed the total synthesis of racemic periplanone B.|$|E

The reduction in amine groups {{as a function}} of time was followed to study the overall reaction kinetics of collagen with either BDDGE or PGE. Linearization of the experimental data resulted in a reaction order of 2 with respect to the amine groups in the PGE masking reaction, whereas a reaction order of 2. 5 was obtained in the BDDGE crosslinking reaction. The reaction orders were independent of the pH in the range of 8. 5 - 10. 5 and the reagent concentration (1 - 4 wt %). The reaction order with respect to <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> was equal to 1 for both reagents. As expected, the reaction rate was favored by a higher reagent concentration and a higher solution pH. Because the BDDGE crosslinking reaction occurs via two distinct reaction steps, the content of pendant <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> in the collagen matrix was determined by treating the collagen with either O-phosphoryl ethanolamine or lysine methyl ester. The increase in either phosphor or primary amine groups was related to the content of pendant groups. Crosslinking at pH 9. 0 resulted in a low reaction rate but in a high crosslink efficacy, especially after prolonged reaction times. A maximum concentration of pendant <b>epoxide</b> <b>groups</b> was detected after 50 h. Reaction at pH 10. 0 was faster, but a lower crosslinking efficacy was obtained.

5000|$|Polyfunctional primary amines form an {{important}} class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an addition reaction with the <b>epoxide</b> <b>group</b> {{to form a}} hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.Aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Reactivity is broadly in the order aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Whilst aromatic amines were once widely used as epoxy resin hardeners due to the excellent end properties they imparted, health concerns with handling these materials means that they have now largely been replaced by safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alternatives.|$|E

Lauryl methacrylate (LMA) a poor water soluble long chain vinyl monomer is commercially available. Polystyrene/poly(LMA-divinyl benzene) or PS/P(LMA-DVB) composite seed particles were first prepared by slightly modified activated swelling of micron-sized PS seed particles utilizing either water or water-ethanol dispersion medium. The influence of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as steric stabilizer {{on the size}} and size distribution was evaluated. The poor solubility of LMA in the continuous phase hindered the homogeneous swelling of PS particles even {{in the presence of}} ethanol (5 % w/w) and resulted in fairly polydispersed PS/P(LMA-DVB) composite seed particles. The composite seed particles were then functionalized with <b>epoxide</b> <b>group</b> by seeded polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) to produce PS/P(LMA-DVB) /PGMA composite polymer particles.
