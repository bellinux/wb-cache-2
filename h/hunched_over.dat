5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E

Dahl's winning entry:The heather-encrusted Headlands, veiled in fog as thick as smoke in a crowded pub, <b>hunched</b> precariously <b>over</b> the moors, their rocky elbows slipping off land's end, their bulbous, craggy noses thrust into the thick foam of the North Sea like bearded old men falling asleep in their pints.|$|R
60|$|The solitary man {{who drove}} this curious car was broad and burly. He sat <b>hunched</b> up <b>over</b> his steering-wheel, with {{the brim of}} a Tyrolean hat drawn down over his eyes. The red end of a {{cigarette}} smouldered under the black shadow thrown by the headgear. A dark ulster of some frieze-like material was {{turned up in the}} collar until it covered his ears. His neck was pushed forward from his rounded shoulders, and he seemed, as the car now slid noiselessly down the long sloping road, with the clutch disengaged and the engine running free, to be peering ahead of him through the darkness in search of some eagerly-expected object.|$|R
25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, {{had no one to}} play with and no one to talk to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E

Some show the beast trotting like a horse with a horn; others <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> with head to the ground, like a bison, and still others immersed in swamps like a hippopotamus. The use of the horn {{and whether or not}} there was one, and how large, have been popular topics. The statistical correlations of modern palaeontology have taken much of the speculation out of the subject, although some details remain undetermined.|$|E

2500|$|Seeking a new band, Hackett {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in Melody Maker stating {{that he was}} looking for musicians [...] "determined to strive beyond existing stagnant music forms". The advert was responded to by Genesis lead vocalist Peter Gabriel. Genesis, which also featured keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and drummer Phil Collins, had recently lost founding guitarist Anthony Phillips and, after seeing them perform, Hackett auditioned for the group. He joined in December 1970. Hackett had little on stage playing experience when he joined Genesis, but he soon settled into his role, and his unique stage image of wearing glasses and seated in a <b>hunched</b> position <b>over</b> his guitar, served as a counter to Gabriel's extravagant costumes and theatrics.|$|R
40|$|It {{all started}} in Las Vegas. A lone figure {{adorned with a}} floral pattern silk shirt <b>hunched</b> maniacally <b>over</b> a {{fire-engine}} red IBM Selectric typewriter in the gray Nevada dawn, a macabre journalist typing away in the squalor of his once luxurious hotel suite convinced {{that he is a}} “monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger ” (Thompson, 1971). My own personal research into the American author/propagandist, admittedly originally inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, led me to a cultural/rhetorical investigation of Eastern and Western poetry. I set out with the naive intention of analyzing pieces of poetry from different cultures and performing an analysis of the rhetorical devices employed by the authors. Realizing the staggeringly ambiguous nature of this query, I then sought to narrow my focus and settle on those works that were written directly before, during, or after periods of social/political instability, more specifically revolution, occupation, civil war, etc. With this common denominator, I analyzed the rhetorical devices employed by the authors and discovered some surprising similarities between the pieces, as I expected that, because of the different attitudes towards rhetoric in “Eastern ” and “Western ” cultures, the device...|$|R
6000|$|Two {{pictures}} {{come into}} my memory. I have {{climbed to the top}} of a tree by the edge of the playing field, and am looking at my school-fellows and am as proud of myself as a March cock when it crows to its first sunrise. I am saying to myself, [...] "if when I grow up I am as clever among grown-up men as I am among these boys, I shall be a famous man." [...] I remind myself how they think all the same things and cover the school walls at election times with the opinions their fathers find in the newspapers. I remind myself that I am an artist's son and must take some work as the whole end of life and not think as the others do of becoming well off and living pleasantly. The other picture is of a hotel sitting-room in the Strand, where a man is <b>hunched</b> up <b>over</b> the fire. He is a cousin who has speculated with another cousin's money and has fled from Ireland in danger of arrest. My father has brought us to spend the evening with him, to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering.|$|R
500|$|With a one ball, two strike pitch from relief pitcher Randy Choate {{incoming}} to Cubs outfielder Nate Schierholtz in a May 4 game, {{the batter}} foul tipped the pitch. [...] Instead of Molina {{being in a}} position to catch it cleanly with his glove, the ball hit the thigh. [...] Molina instantly <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> the ball, trapping it between the thigh and rib cage. [...] He held on, qualifying it as a third strike.|$|E
500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All I {{could think of was}} my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E
500|$|The dead {{rise from}} their graves around Michael's feet; some emerge to walk towards Heaven, others towards Hell. They are tiny {{compared}} to Christ and the saints. Lorne Campbell notes that these panels display a deeply pessimistic view of humanity, with the damned far outnumbering the saved, especially compared to Stefan Lochner's Cologne panel, where the saved crowd {{the entrance to}} Heaven. The dead undergo a gradual transformation as they move from panel to panel. The souls rising at Michael's feet show little expression, becoming more animated as they move to either side; horror and desperation become especially visible {{on the faces of}} the damned as they move towards Hell. On the left, the saved all have, according to Jacobs, [...] "the same beatific expressions", but their postures gradually change from facing Christ and Michael to looking towards Heaven's gate, notably with the couple below Mary– the man turns the woman's gaze away from Michael, towards Heaven. This contrasts with another couple on the opposite panel who face Hell; the woman is <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> as the man raises his hand in vain to beseech God for mercy.|$|E
60|$|Faster, faster, faster! That old resistless weight {{began to}} press Madeline back; the old incessant bellow of wind filled her ears. Link Stevens <b>hunched</b> low <b>over</b> the wheel. His eyes were hidden under leather helmet and goggles, but {{the lower part}} of his face was unprotected. He resembled a demon, so dark and stone-hard and strangely {{grinning}} was he. All at once Madeline realized how matchless, how wonderful a driver was this cowboy. She divined that weakening could not have been possible to Link Stevens. He was a cowboy, and he really was riding that car, making it answer to his will, as it had been born in him to master a horse. He had never driven to suit himself, had never reached an all-satisfying speed until now. Beyond that his motive was to save Stewart--to make Madeline happy. Life was nothing to him. That fact gave him the superhuman nerve to face the peril of this ride. Because of his disregard of self he was able to operate the machine, to choose the power, the speed, the guidance, the going with the best judgment and highest efficiency possible. Madeline knew he would get her to Mezquital in time to save Stewart or he would kill her in the attempt.|$|R
60|$|No great {{distance}} was covered, however, before Bells swerved to the left, {{out of line}} with Black Star and Night. Then Venters, aiming high and waiting for the pause between Wrangle's great strides, began to take snap shots at the rustler. The fleeing rider presented a broad target for a rifle, but he was moving swiftly forward and bobbing up and down. Moreover, shooting from Wrangle's back was shooting from a thunderbolt. And added to that was the danger of a low-placed bullet taking effect on Bells. Yet, despite these considerations, making the shot exceedingly difficult, Venters's confidence, like his implacability, saw a speedy and fatal termination of that rustler's race. On the sixth shot the rustler threw up his arms and took a flying tumble off his horse. He rolled <b>over</b> and <b>over,</b> <b>hunched</b> himself to a half-erect position, fell, and then dragged himself into the sage. As Venters went thundering by he peered keenly into the sage, but caught no sign of the man. Bells ran a few hundred yards, slowed up, and had stopped when Wrangle passed him.|$|R
60|$|Bostil's {{anger and}} anxiety {{might never have}} been. The light of the upland rider's joy shone in his keen gaze. The slope before him was open, and almost level, down to the ridge that had hidden the missing girl and horse. Buckles was running {{for the love of}} running, as the girl low down over his neck was riding for the love of riding. The Sage King whistled again, and shot off with graceful sweep to meet them; Sarchedon plunged after him; Two Face and Plume jealously trooped down, too, but Dusty Ben, after a toss of his head, went on grazing. The gray and the black met Buckles and could not turn in time to stay with him. A girl's gay scream pealed up the slope, and Buckles went lower and faster. Sarchedon was left behind. Then the gray King began to run as if before he had been loping. He was {{beautiful}} in action. This was play--a game--a race--plainly dominated by the spirit of the girl. Lucy's hair was a bright stream of gold in the wind. She rode bareback. It seemed that she was <b>hunched</b> low <b>over</b> Buckles with her knees high on his back--scarcely astride him at all. Yet her motion was one with the horse. Again that wild, gay scream pealed out--call or laugh or challenge. Sage King, with a fleetness that made the eyes of Bostil and his riders glisten, took the lead, and then sheered off to slow down, while Buckles thundered past. Lucy was pulling him hard, and had him plunging to a halt, when the rider Holley ran out to grasp his bridle. Buckles was snorting and his ears were laid back. He pounded the ground and scattered the pebbles.|$|R
500|$|The cover photo {{features}} (from left to right) Johnny, Tommy, Joey and Dee Dee Ramone, {{staring at}} the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, {{with the majority of}} their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that [...] "Tommy [...] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [...] <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> a bit." [...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: [...] "We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused." ...|$|E
500|$|It was Plath's {{publication}} of Ariel in 1965 that precipitated her rise to fame. As {{soon as it}} was published, critics began to see the collection as the charting of Plath's increasing desperation or death wish. Her dramatic death became her most famous aspect, and remains so. Time and Life both reviewed the slim volume of Ariel in the wake of her death. The critic at Time said: [...] "Within a week of her death, intellectual London was <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. 'Daddy' was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, 'Daddy' was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life breathed a burning river of bile across the literary landscape. [...] In her most ferocious poems, 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus,' fear, hate, love, death and the poet's own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims. They are poems, as Robert Lowell says in his preface to Ariel, that 'play Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Cézanne solved this [...] "spatial conundrum" [...] in the final three {{versions}} of The Card Players, by eliminating spectators and other [...] "unnecessary detail" [...] while displaying only the [...] "absolute essentials": two players immersed in their game. The scene {{has been described as}} balanced but asymmetrical, as well as naturally symmetrical with the two players being each other's [...] "partner in an agreed opposition". The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> the table. Even cards themselves are contrasting light and dark hues. In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants as well as the center of the painting's [...] "symmetrical balance".|$|E
2500|$|Cranston {{contributed a}} great deal to the character's persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the {{development}} of the series, the actor wrote his own back story for the character. At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline. He had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed a regular brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as [...] "impotent" [...] and like a [...] "dead caterpillar". Cranston has also repeatedly identified elements in scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled, and has {{gone so far as to}} call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his father for how Walt carries himself physically, which he described as [...] "a little <b>hunched</b> <b>over,</b> never erect, [...] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders". In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as [...] "a kid trapped in a man's body".|$|E

The Cutter plans on removing Bette's ears as part of a plan to create a perfect woman through the use of stolen body parts. Batwoman rescues Bette from the killer and accidentally reveals her identity. At the end of the story, Bette is seen in her Flamebird outfit, telling Kate that she wants to become her new partner. Kate eventually agrees to train Bette, and gives her a capeless grey military outfit and the codename Plebe. Later still, Bette acquires pyrotechnic technology and adopts the codename Hawkfire.|$|E

Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a [...] "Sly" [...] beltbuckle and a silver lamé suit, he joined in on [...] "I Want To Take You Higher." [...] <b>Hunched</b> <b>over</b> the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked {{to the front of the}} stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. [...] "He went up the ramp , got on a motorcycle and took off," [...] Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Ehrlich said Stone refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began.|$|E

He kept silent, though every time the ball fooled a Natchez player Daddy wanted to yell. And when it started for Bo and, as if in revenge, bounded wickeder at every bounce to skip off the grass and make Bo look ridiculous, then Daddy experienced the happiest moments of his baseball career. Every time a tally crossed the plate he would chalk it down on his soap box.|$|E

Summerlee was on guard, sitting <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> our small fire, a quaint, angular figure, his rifle across his knees and his pointed, goat-like beard wagging with each weary nod of his head. Lord John lay silent, wrapped in the South American poncho which he wore, while Challenger snored with a roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods. The full moon was shining brightly, {{and the air was}} crisply cold. What a night for a walk! And then suddenly came the thought, [...] "Why not?" [...] Suppose I stole softly away, suppose I made my way down to the central lake, suppose I was back at breakfast with some record of the place--would I not in that case be thought an even more worthy associate? Then, if Summerlee carried the day and some means of escape were found, we should return to London with first-hand knowledge of the central mystery of the plateau, to which I alone, of all men, would have penetrated. I thought of Gladys, with her [...] "There are heroisms all round us." [...] I seemed to hear her voice as she said it. I thought also of McArdle. What a three column article for the paper! What a foundation for a career! A correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach. I clutched at a gun--my pockets were full of cartridges--and, parting the thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba, quickly slipped out. My last glance showed me the unconscious Summerlee, most futile of sentinels, still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the smouldering fire.|$|E
