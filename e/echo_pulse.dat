The phase synchronization is also solved as long as no additional phase difference is introduced by the two receive channels. This is because the phase errors caused by the transmitter are the same in direct and <b>echo</b> <b>pulses</b> and hence can be counteracted; besides, as the direct and the <b>echo</b> <b>pulses</b> are received with small time difference, the phase errors caused by the receiver in direct and in <b>echo</b> <b>pulses</b> are nearly the same and also can be counteracted.

Research has shown that return waveforms can give even more detailed insights into the vertical structure of surface objects, surface slope, roughness and reflectivity than the conventional systems.

A drug eluting coronary stent (Endeavor, cobalt alloy, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA) was evaluated for magnetic field interactions, heating, and artifacts at 3 Tesla. MRI-related heating was assessed with the stent in a gelled saline-filled phantom using a transmit/received RF body coil with a whole body averaged SAR of 2. 0 W/kg. Artifacts were characterized using T 1 -weighted, spin echo, and gradient <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequences. Results. The stent exhibited minor magnetic field interactions that will not cause migration. Heating was not substantial (+ 0. 5 C). Artifacts may create a problem if the area of interest {{is in the same}} area or close to the stent (e. g., for a T 1 -weighted, spin <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequence, within approximately 16 mm; for a gradient <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequence, within approximately 23 mm).

40|$|The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) {{on board}} ICESat {{spacecraft}} measures the surface height (altimetry) via {{the time of}} flight of its 1064 nm laser pulse. The GLAS laser transmitter produces 6 ns wide pulses with 70 mJ energy at 1064 nm at a 40 Hz rate. The altimeter receiver consists of a telescope, aft optics, a silicon avalanche photodiode, and electronic amplifiers. The transmitted and <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> waveforms are digitized at 1 GHz rate. The laser pulse time of flight is determined on the ground from the two digitized pulse waveforms and their positions in the full waveform record (about 5. 4 ms ong) by computing the pulse centroids or by curve fitting. The GLAS receiver algorithms in on board software selects the two waveform segments containing the transmitted and the echo pulses and sends them to ground. The probability of <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> detection and the accuracy of time of flight measurement depend on the received signal level, the background light within the receiver field of view, the inherent detector and amplifier noise, the quantization of the digitizer, and some times by cloud obscurations. A receiver model has been developed to calculate the probability of detection and accuracy of the altimeter measurements with these noise sources. From prelaunch testing, the minimum detectable <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> energy for 90 % detection probability was about 0. 1 fj/pulse onto the detector. Such a receiver sensitivity allows GLAS to measure the surface height through clouds with optical density less than 2. The <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> energy required to achieve 10 cm ranging accuracy {{was found to be}} about 3 times higher than the minimum detectable signal level. The smallest single shot range measurement error, which was determined by ranging to a fixed target with strong echo pulses and no background light, was 2 to 3 cm. The maximum linear response <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> energy was 10 fJ/pulse for the strongest echo signals, assuming a Lambertian scattering snow surface, clear sky atmosphere transmission, and no pulse width spreading due to surface slopes. Results from the initial 38 days of GLAS operation on-orbit with Laser 1, showed the <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> energies varied, as expected, over a wide dynamic range due to the variability of atmosphere transmission and Earth surface characteristics. The receiver was able to reliably detect the ground surface echoes and measure time of flight under such dynamic conditions, except when there were dense clouds. When over Antarctica, the <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> energies were several times stronger than predicted. This suggests that the 1064 nm backscattering from the snow pack and ice-sheet &ce are not completely Lambertian but is somewhat peaked at opposit. ion. With Laser 1, the peak amplitude of the echo pulses from flat ice sheets under clear sky conditions exceeded the linear response range of the receiver, causing some pulse waveform distortion due to saturation. We have characterized the effects of receiver saturation on the time of flight, pulse width, and pulse energy measurements for flat surface by testing a night spare detector in the lab with simulated echo pulses. A data processing algorithm that minimizes the errors due to saturation for these measurements are described...|$|E

In this paper, solutions based on state-of-the-art numerical methods, including the Discrete Wavelet Transform and Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map, are proposed to carry out these tasks.

40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} {{excellent}} specialised texts and articles that describe the physical principles of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques. There are also many texts written with the clinician {{in mind that}} provide an understandable, more general introduction to the basic physical principles of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques and applications. There are however very few texts or articles that attempt to provide a basic MR physics introduction that is tailored for clinicians using CMR in their daily practice. This {{is the first of}} two reviews that are intended to cover the essential aspects of CMR physics {{in a way that is}} understandable and relevant to this group. It begins by explaining the basic physical principles of MR, including a description of the main components of an MR imaging system and the three types of magnetic field that they generate. The origin and method of production of the MR signal in biological systems are explained, focusing in particular on the two tissue magnetisation relaxation properties (T 1 and T 2) that give rise to signal differences from tissues, showing how they can be exploited to generate image contrast for tissue characterisation. The method most commonly used to localise and encode MR signal echoes to form a cross sectional image is described, introducing the concept of k-space and showing how the MR signal data stored within it relates to properties within the reconstructed image. Before describing the CMR acquisition methods in detail, the basic spin echo and gradient pulse sequences are introduced, identifying the key parameters that influence image contrast, including appearances in the presence of flowing blood, resolution and image acquisition time. The main derivatives of these two pulse sequences used for cardiac imaging are then described in more detail. Two of the key requirements for CMR are the need for data acquisition first to be to be synchronised with the subject's ECG and to be fast enough for the subject to be able to hold their breath. Methods of ECG synchronisation using both triggering and retrospective gating approaches, and accelerated data acquisition using turbo or fast spin echo and gradient <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequences are therefore outlined in some detail. It is shown how double inversion black blood preparation combined with turbo or fast spin <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequences acquisition is used to achieve high quality anatomical imaging. For functional cardiac imaging using cine gradient <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequences two derivatives of the gradient <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> sequence; spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) are compared. In each case key relevant imaging parameters and vendor-specific terms are defined and explained. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Because the nearspace slow-moving {{platform}} borne {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) can realize high resolution imaging using low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), a full-aperture ScanSAR (FA-ScanSAR) operation, which switches the range beam pulse by pulse, was proposed for wide swath imaging. This operation separates the wide swath into several sub-swaths, and each {{of which can be}} illuminated by a narrow range beam. The SAR antenna switches the range beam to point at each of the sub-swaths in turn, transmits <b>pulses</b> and receives <b>echoes</b> <b>pulse</b> by pulse.

A design example is given to compare the performance of the conventional strip operation, ScanSAR and FA-ScanSAR operation.

Filtering is also required to shape each received signal into a form suitable for processing by a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) followed by a time-to-digital converter (TDC).

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of an earlier work by Nygrén et al. (2012), where the velocity of a hard target was determined from a set of echo pulses reflected by the target flying through the radar beam. Here the method is extended to include the determination of range at a high accuracy. The method is as follows. First, the flight time of the pulse from the transmitter to the target is determined at an accuracy essentially better than the accuracy given by the sampling interval. This method makes use {{of the fact that the}} receiver filtering creates slopes at the phase flips of the phase modulated <b>echo</b> <b>pulse.</b> A precise flight time is found by investigating the echo amplitude within this slope. A value of velocity is calculated from each <b>echo</b> <b>pulse</b> as explained in the earlier paper. Next, the ranges together with velocities from a single beam pass are combined to a measurement vector for a linear inversion problem. The solution of the inversion problem gives the time-dependent range and velocity from the time interval of satellite flight through the radar beam. The method is demonstrated using the EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter) UHF radar and radio pulses reflected by a satellite. The achieved standard deviations of range are about 5 – 50 cm and those of velocity are about 3 – 25 mm s − 1...|$|E
