Following several media controversies, West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with. The song features rapper and occasional singer Kid Cudi, a performer West once described as his favorite artist. The two had previously collaborated on West's fourth album 808s & Heartbreak, an album {{that served as a}} big influence on Cudi. As a friend of West, Cudi was invited to Hawaii to listen to recording sessions of the album. One day when Cudi was <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio, he overheard the composition of [...] "Gorgeous", which he was overwhelmed by. He asked immediately to be featured on the track. While a {{majority of}} the artists who worked on the album passed their time playing games of basketball, Cudi smoked marijuana and worked-out on a treadmill in preparation of the recording of his lines. On the recording of the song, Cudi mused; ...|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio. We {{asked him to come}} freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of the}} sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E
5000|$|The usual liturgical {{color in}} Western Christianity for Advent is violet (or purple). The violet or purple color {{is often used}} for <b>hangings</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> church, the vestments of the clergy, and often also the tabernacle. In some Christian denominations, blue, a color {{representing}} hope, is an alternative liturgical color for Advent, a custom traced to the usage of the Church of Sweden (Lutheran) and the medieval Sarum Rite in England. In addition, the color blue is also used in the Mozarabic Rite (Catholic and Anglican), which dates from the 8th century. This color {{is often referred to}} as [...] "Sarum blue".|$|R

500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Murray's {{family lived}} in poverty and were {{constantly}} moving to different areas of London, which meant that he was often bullied and involved in fights. By the time his family settled in Clapton in 1970, Murray joined a skinhead gang and [...] "had a violent {{couple of years of}} being out on the street." [...] He developed an interest in rock music when he was 15 after hearing [...] "Voodoo Chile" [...] by Jimi Hendrix on the radio, about which he recalls, [...] "everything changed, just like that. Getting into rock music wasn't like a gradual process for me; it was completely sort of extreme, totally black and white. I heard 'Voodoo Chile' on the radio and I thought, 'Bloody hell! What is THAT? How do you do THAT?' And I started <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rock music section of the record stores and buying albums, thinking about getting into the big time, wondering what that would be like." [...] After [...] "hanging 'round record stores" [...] and acquiring several Hendrix and blues albums, Murray decided to take up the guitar. At 16, he formed his first band, a trio called Stone Free, which also included Adrian Smith on vocals, who would also become a member of Iron Maiden in 1980. From there, Murray would answer ads in Melody Maker and regularly audition for different bands at the weekend, leading to short stints in Electric Gas, [...] "this sort of soft-rock, American-type band," [...] and The Secret, [...] "this sort of mad punk band," [...] with whom he would record a single, [...] "Café De Dance", in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|The {{widespread}} use of the swan as a badge largely derives from {{the legend of the}} Swan Knight, today most familiar from Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin. [...] A group of Old French [...] chansons de geste called the Crusade cycle had associated the legend with the ancestors of Godfrey of Bouillon (d. 1100), the hero of the First Crusade. [...] Although Godfrey had no legitimate issue, his family had many descendants among the aristocracy of Europe, many of whom made use of the swan in their heraldry or as a para-heraldic emblem. [...] In England these included the important de Bohun family, which used the so-called Bohun swan as its heraldic badge; [...] after the marriage in 1380 of Mary de Bohun (d. 1394) to the future King Henry IV of England, the swan became adopted by the House of Lancaster, who continued to use it for over a century. The swan with the crown and chain is especially associated with Lancastrian use; it echoes the crown and chain of Richard II's white hart, which he began to use as a livery badge from 1390. [...] As well as several of his own white hart badges, Richard's treasure roll of 1397 also includes a swan badge with a gold chain, perhaps presented by one of his enemies mentioned above: [...] "Item, a gold swan enamelled white with a little gold chain <b>hanging</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neck, weighing 2 oz., value, 46s. 8d". [...] He declared to Parliament that he had exchanged liveries with his uncles as a sign of amity at various moments of reconciliation.|$|E
