The MRE 113A respirable dust sampler developed for use in our pneumoconiosis research was the first landmark and led to greater insight into the causes of this disease. Under Dr Jim Vincent's leadership, an innovative research programme, begun by Dr Trevor Ogden, was aimed at designing new sampling instruments for coarser aerosols. The culmination of this work was the development of the IOM <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> sampler, which has become established as the device of choice for measuring the part of an aerosol that penetrates beyond the larynx.

The following parameters were evaluated in a chamber containing two pigs of 10 kg body-weight: <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> gravimetric concentrations were measured using area samplers and expressed as mg/m 3. The respirable dust concentration was also measured using a "TM digital microP respirable dust-measuring instrument', which {{has been shown to}} give similar results to the gravimetric method. The endotoxin concentration was evaluated using the Limulus-assay and expressed as ng/m 3 of air containing the <b>inhalable</b> or respirable <b>dust</b> or as ng/mg of <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>dust.</b> Feed flour dust was introduced into the chamber to obtain different concentrations of <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> ranging from 3. 62 to 76. 66 mg/m 3 and from 0. 24 to 1. 40 mg/m 3, respectively. The endotoxin concentration was modulated by mixing the feed flour with Escherichia coli endotoxins before blowing it into the chamber.

Estimating historical skin exposures of farmers dipping sheep in pesticide solutions for an epidemiological study proved particularly challenging, but this research demonstrated a strong association between concentrated organophosphate pesticides and neurological symptoms. As a consequence the UK government withdrew these pesticides from the market until safer handling systems were devised. In addition, new sampling instruments to measure dermal exposure to chemicals and new theoretical models to help understand how skin exposure may arise.

40|$|Workers in the {{agricultural}} industry exhibit higher rates of respiratory diseases than workers who are not employed in agriculture. Farm workers may be chronically exposed to organic dust, which is composed of molds, fungi, pesticides, herbicides, animal-derived particles, feed and bedding particles, and endotoxin. Exposure to organic dust {{has been linked to}} the development of various respiratory diseases. Research evidence has shown that variability in exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> is present, and no studies have assessed variability in exposures to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> specifically among dairy parlor workers. A field-based study was conducted to assess exposures to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> exposure among individuals working as milkers or pushers on dairy farms in the Midwestern United States. A total of 62 dairy parlor workers participated, and 18 of these workers agreed to participate in repeat measurements and were sampled for two work shifts. Two, bilateral personal breathing zone samples were collected continuously from each worker during one work shift using inhalable samplers, amounting to 160 <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentration measurements. The filters were weighed, and the TWA of inhalable airborne dust exposure was calculated for each subject and reported in mg/m 3. Statistical analyses were used to examine exposure variability. The results of the statistical analyses did not indicate any statistically significant differences in the means of exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> between paired sampler groups, with p-values of 0. 793, 0. 617, and 0. 619. An ANOVA analysis of within-worker variance found no statistically significant differences, with p-values of 0. 702 and 0. 744 for sampler location and sampling day, respectively. Results of the simple linear regression analyses suggested that temperature and humidity levels contribute to less than ten percent of the variability in <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations. Analyses of the study indicate that exposure to inhalable agricultural dust does not vary significantly (p-value of 0. 05 or less) between the means of right-side and left-side collected exposures, as well as from day-to-day, among dairy parlor workers. The geometric mean of 0. 54 mg/m 3 (GSD 2. 5 mg/m 3) of the <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations from this study align with geometric means found in previous studies of <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations among dairy farm workers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to determine prevalences of sensitization to bakery-associated antigens (BAAs) and work-related respiratory symptoms at a large commercial bakery. METHODS: The following measurements were carried out: personal breathing zone (PBZ) and general area (GA) monitoring for <b>inhalable</b> flour <b>dust,</b> α-amylase and wheat, a questionnaire, and blood tests for IgE specific to flour dust, wheat, α-amylase, and common aeroallergens. RESULTS: Of 186 bakery employees present during our site visit, 161 completed the questionnaire and 96 allowed their blood to be drawn. The geometric mean PBZ and GA <b>inhalable</b> flour <b>dust</b> concentrations for the lower-exposure group was 0. 235 mg/m(3), and for the higher-exposure group was 3. 01 mg/m(3). Employees in the higher-exposure group had significantly higher prevalences of work-related wheezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and frequent sneezing than the lower-exposure group. The prevalence of IgE specific to wheat was significantly higher among employees who ever had {{a job in the}} higher-exposure group or in production at another bakery at both the ≥ 0. 10 kU/L and the ≥ 0. 35 kU/L cutoffs, and to flour dust and α-amylase at the ≥ 0. 10 kU/L cutoff, compared to the lower-exposure group.

Methods: Work-related allergy and asthma were assessed on history, clinical evaluation, pulmonary function and fractional exhaled nitric oxide. Specific IgE reactivity to a range of common inhalant, food and spice allergens was evaluated using ImmunoCAP and allergen microarray. The presence of non-IgE-mediated reactions was determined by basophil stimulation (CAST-ELISA). Specific allergens were identified by immunoblotting to extracts of raw and dried processed garlic, onion and chili pepper. Results: Asthma was confirmed in all 3 subjects, with work-related patterns prominent in worker 1 and 3. Sensitization to multiple spices and pollen was observed in both atopic workers 1 and 2, whereas garlic and chili pepper sensitization featured in all 3 workers. Microarray analysis demonstrated prominent profilin reactivity in atopic worker 2. Immunoblotting demonstrated a 50 -kDa cross-reactive allergen in garlic and onion, and allergens of approximately 40 and 52 kDa in chili pepper. Dry powdered garlic and onion demonstrated greater IgE binding. Conclusions: This study demonstrated IgE reactivity to multiple spice allergens in workers exposed to high levels of <b>inhalable</b> spice <b>dust.</b> Processed garlic and onion powder demonstrated stronger IgE reactivity than the raw plant.

40|$|Objective- A {{case study}} {{was carried out}} to assess cement dust {{exposure}} and its determinants among construction workers and for comparison among workers in cement and concrete production. Methods- Full-shift personal exposure measurements were performed and samples were analysed for <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> and its cement content. Exposure variability was modelled with linear mixed models. Results- <b>Inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations at the construction site ranged from 0. 05 to 34 mg/m(3), {{with a mean of}} 1. 0 mg/m(3). Average concentration for inhalable cement dust was 0. 3 mg/m(3) (GM; range 0. 02 - 17 mg/m(3)). Levels in the ready-mix and pre-cast concrete plants were on average 0. 5 mg/m(3) (GM) for <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> and 0. 2 mg/m(3) (GM) for inhalable cement dust. Highest concentrations were measured in cement production, particularly during cleaning tasks (<b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> GM = 55 mg/m(3); inhalable cement dust GM = 33 mg/m(3)) at which point the workers wore personal protective equipment. Elemental measurements showed highest but very variable cement percentages in the cement plant and very low percentages during reinforcement work and pouring. Most likely other sources were contributing to dust concentrations, particularly at the construction site. Within job groups, temporal variability in exposure concentrations generally outweighed differences in average concentrations between workers. 'Using a broom', 'outdoor wind speed' and 'presence of rain' were overall the most influential factors affecting inhalable (cement) dust exposure. Conclusion- Job type appeared to be the main predictor of exposure to inhalable (cement) dust at the construction site. <b>Inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations in cement production plants, especially during cleaning tasks, are usually considerably higher than at the construction site...|$|E

40|$|For about 20 years, {{between the}} 60 ’s and the 80 ’s {{of the last}} century, in the Passo a Campalto area (Lagoon of Venice - Italy) about 400, 000 m 3 of {{phosphogypsum}} (PG) were deposited at {{the border of the}} lagoon and next to urban areas without any environmental control. These materials are a by-product formed during the wet processing of phosphate rocks by sulphuric acid and have a significant environmental impact due to their abundance and their chemical-physical and radiochemical characteristics. The PG contains both chemical elements, which are considered dangerous for the ecosystems and natural radionuclides whose concentrations are much higher if compared to those typical for the Earth’s crust. These discarded materials caused for many years the dispersion of radionuclides in the environment due to the tidal erosion, the re-suspension of radioactive <b>inhalable</b> <b>dusts,</b> the uncontrolled radon exhalation and the bioaccumulation of some radionuclides in the lagoon environment. After a decision of the appointed authorities, the Venice Water Authority (Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport), planned a permanent safety control of the site resulting in the complete isolation of the entire volume of contaminated materials from the environmental system. The entire project was specific for the particular features of the site and it required the improvement of analytical, sampling and measurement techniques in order to verify the effectiveness of the safety action. The radon assessment, in particular the check of the effectiveness of the inhibition of radon exhalation, is part of a more complex study, covering many other aspects of the management of a permanent disposal; they will be the object of further notes.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Dairy working {{increases}} {{the prevalence of}} lower airway respiratory diseases, especially COPD and asthma. Epidemiological studies have reported that chronic inhalation of organic dusts released during specific daily tasks could represent a major risk factor for development of these pathologies in dairy workers. Knowledge on size, nature and biological activity of such organic dusts remain however limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare size distribution, microbial composition and cellular effects of dusts liberated by the spreading of straw bedding in five French dairy farms located in Brittany. RESULTS: Mechanized distribution of straw bedding generated a cloud of <b>inhalable</b> <b>dusts</b> in the five dairy farms' barns. Thoracic particles having a 3 - 7. 5 µm size constituted 58. 9 - 68. 3 % of these dusts. Analyses of thoracic dusts by next generation sequencing showed that the microbial dust composition differed between the five French farms, although Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria represent more than 97. 5 % of the bacterial phyla detected in each sample. Several bacteria genera comprising of human pathogenic species, such as Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Thermoactinomyces or Saccharopolyspora were identified. Cladosporium and Alternaria fungal genera, which are potent environmental determinants of respiratory symptoms, were detected in dusts collected in the five farms and their levels reached 15. 5 - 51. 1 % and 9 - 24. 7 % of assignable fungal sequences in each sample, respectively. Finally, all dust samples significantly and strongly increased {{the expression of the}} pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8 cytokines at both mRNA and protein levels in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Their effects were dose-dependent and detectable from 1 µg/ml. The intensity of the macrophage responses however differed according to the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strengthen the hypothesis that organic dusts released during the distribution of straw bedding are mainly constituted of thoracic particles which are small enough to deposit on lower bronchial epithelium of dairy farmers and induce inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cotton {{workers are}} highly exposed to organic dust. Inhalation of cotton based {{particulate}} {{has been associated}} with various respiratory symptoms and impaired lung function. This study investigates the respiratory health profile of textile mill workers in Nepal in relation to dust and endotoxin exposure. Methods: This study was conducted in four sectors (garment, carpet, weaving and recycling) of the textile industry in Kathmandu, Nepal. A total of 938 individuals completed a health questionnaire and performed spirometry. A subset of 384 workers performed cross-shift spirometry. Personal exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> and airborne endotoxin was measured during a full-shift for a 114 workers. Results: Geometric mean concentrations of personal exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin were 0. 81 mg/m 3 and 2160 EU/m 3 respectively. Overall prevalence of persistent cough, persistent phlegm, wheeze, breathlessness and chest tightness were 8. 5 %, 12. 5 %, 3. 2 %, 6. 5 %and 3. 6 % respectively. Symptoms were most common among the recyclers and less in the garment sector. Exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> significantly predicted the symptoms of persistent cough and chest tightness. Significant cross-shift reduction in FEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25 _ 75 were measured in the textile workers (p< 0. 001 for all); reductions being greater in the recyclers (- 143 ml) and smallest in the garment workers (- 38 ml) (p= 0. 012). Cross-shift reduction in FEV 1 was significantly predicated by exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust.</b> Exposure to endotoxin did not correlate with any of the respiratory symptoms nor to lung function. Conclusion: The measured association between exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> and reporting of respiratory symptoms and lung function suggests that despite high levels of endotoxin exposures, <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> is the driver for these effects and attention should turn to what might be the toxic component in this dust other than endotoxin.

40|$|International audienceOccupational {{exposure}} to active {{ingredients in the}} pharmaceutical industry {{has been the subject}} of very few published studies. Nevertheless, operations involving active powdered drugs or dusty operations potentially lead to operator exposure. The aim of this study was to collect occupational exposure data in the pharmaceutical industry for production processes involving powdered active ingredients. While the possibility of assessing drug exposure from dust level is examined, this article focuses on <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> exposure, without taking chemical risk into account. A total of 377 atmospheric (ambient and personal) samples were collected in nine drug production sites (pharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations) and the dust levels were assessed. For each sample, relevant contextual information was collected. A wide range of results was observed, both site- and operation-dependent. Exposure to <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> levels varied from 0. 01 mg/m 3 to 135 mg/m 3. Though restricted to dust exposure, the study highlighted some potentially critical situations or operations, in particular manual tasks (loading, unloading, mechanical actions) performed in open systems. Simple preventive measures such as ventilation, containment, and minimization of manual handling should reduce dust emissions and workers' {{exposure to}} <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dust {{sampling}} in Australian {{coal mines}} {{is carried out}} with cyclone separation and collection of the sized particles for weighing, generally over the period of a full shift to measure personal exposure levels to airborne contaminants of employees. This testing methodology is described in AS 2985 for determination of respirable dust and AS 3640 for <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust.</b> These testing methodologies give an accurate figure for the personal dust exposure levels of employees for the period sampled, but cannot be related to any specific longwall operational sources of dust generation or to the efficiency of dust mitigation controls installed at those sources. Fugitive dust on longwalls {{has always been an}} issue of concern for production, safety and the health of workers in the underground coal mining industry both in Australia and globally. Longwall personnel can be exposed to harmful respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> from multiple dust generation sources including, but not limited to: intake entry, belt entry, stageloader/crusher, shearer, and chock advance. With the increase in production created from the advancement in longwall equipment, dust loads have also increased and this has resulted in an increase in exposure levels to personnel. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a new dust monitoring methodology to quantify and document both respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> magnitudes generated from different sources, and assess the efficiency of installed controls for the mitigation of produced dust, using gravimetric sampling as per statutory requirements. The resulting Dust Mitigation Efficiency (DME) model has been developed to identify respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> loads at independent sources of dust generation on longwall faces and quantify the efficiency of installed controls for the mitigation of this produced dust. The DME model will shed some fundamental and scientific insights into an area of genuine concern to the mining community and will enhance the current practices of statutory dust monitoring. It will also offer a significant benefit to the coal mining industry by providing a benchmark or signature dust load monitoring procedure along with the implementation of quantified best mitigation practices. The DME model has been used to identify respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> loads at independent sources of dust generation on longwall faces and quantify the efficiency of installed controls for the mitigation of this produced dust. The data collected from each of the sampled mines during the field trials has been used to create a benchmark or signature for each longwall of those mines in relation to dust loads from different sources of generation to ensure maximum efficiency in removing respirable and inhalable dusts. The DME model has also successfully identified the most efficient installed engineering controls operating at individual sources of respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> generation on operating longwalls in Australia. The use of the DME model as opposed to the statutory measurement process will allow mine operators to establish a dust mitigation regime based on the measured best practice for installed engineering controls. A total of 360 samples were taken for data analysis to quantify the robustness of the DME model and determination of the best practice engineering controls. Of these, 190 were respirable samples and the remaining 170 were inhalable samples. With the DME model, it is envisaged that a greater reduction in both respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> can be achieved with best practice engineering, which will have a direct reduction in exposure levels to workers on the face and significantly reduce the risk of lung disease in employees. The establishment of the DME model for respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> load identification and control efficiency determination has shown to be a valuable and robust informational tool that will have a significant benefit to not only the underground coal industry, but all industries that are affected by airborne contaminants less than 10 m in size (PM 10). The ability to understand the actual dust production, coupled with the quantification of performance of installed engineering controls for dust mitigation, will give all operators of dust producing activities a valuable tool to better control their airborne contaminants. It is suggested that further studies be undertaken to include; - the use of Personal Dust Monitors (PDM’s) for data collection with the DME model used to calculate efficiencies; - use of the DME model to better understand respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> production and control in development panels and bord and pillar mining; - medical research be conducted to understand how much respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> is actually required to be ingested to create medical problems, and; - comprehensive research into the accuracy of current exposure level limits and their suitability to the continually increasing production in the global mining industry. By better understanding respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>dust</b> production and application of a best management practice to mitigate airborne contaminants, a significantly healthier workplace and environment will be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to assess the {{pulmonary}} reactions associated with exposure to raw materials used in ceramic production (RMCP). This was a cross sectional study in which 33 male workers with current exposure to RMCP and 20 healthy male unexposed workers (referent group) were interviewed and respiratory symptom questionnaires were administered to them. Furthermore, they underwent chest X-ray and lung function tests. Additionally, personal dust monitoring for airborne <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> was carried out at dusty areas of the industry. To determine the chemical composition, possible silica phases and SiO 2 contents of dust samples, they were analyzed by both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques. Demographic and socioeconomic variables of both groups were similar, except that referent individuals were, to some extent, older and heavier than their exposed counterparts. Personal dust monitoring showed that the concentrations of <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>dust</b> were very high and dust contained large amounts of crystalline silica. Additionally, respiratory symptom questionnaires revealed that exposed workers, compared to their unexposed counterparts, had higher prevalences of cough, wheezing, phlegm and shortness of breath. Likewise, significant decrements in some parameters of pulmonary function were noted and most of the exposed subjects showed abnormalities in their chest radiographs. These data provide further evidence in favor of the notion that exposure to RMCP, probably due to their silica contents, is associated with respiratory symptoms, radiographic abnormalities and functional impairments.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} occupational exposure to <b>inhalable</b> wood <b>dust</b> by country, industry, the level of exposure and type of wood dust in 25 member states of the European Union (EU- 25) for the purposes of hazard control, exposure surveillance and assessment of health risks. National labour force statistics, a country questionnaire (in 15 member states, EU- 15), a company survey (in Finland, France, Germany and Spain), exposure measurements (from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and expert judgements were used to generate preliminary estimates of exposure to different types of wood dust. The estimates were generated according to industrial class (six wood industries, four other sectors) and level of exposure (five classes). These estimates were reviewed and finalized by national experts from 15 member states. Crude estimates were generated also for 10 new member states (EU- 10). The basic data and final estimates were included in the WOODEX database. In 2000 – 2003, about 3. 6 million workers (2. 0 % of the employed EU- 25 population) were occupationally exposed to <b>inhalable</b> wood <b>dust.</b> Of those, construction employed 1. 2 million exposed workers (33 %), mostly construction carpenters. The numbers of exposed workers were 700 000 (20 %) in the furniture industry, 300 000 (9 %) in the manufacture of builders’ carpentry, 200 000 (5 %) in sawmilling, 150 000 (4 %) in forestry and < 100 000 in other wood industries. In addition, there were 700 000 exposed workers (20 %) in miscellaneous industries employing carpenters, joiners and other woodworkers. The numbers of exposed workers varied by country ranging from < 3000 in Luxembourg and Malta to 700 000 in Germany. The highest exposure levels were estimated to occur in the construction sectorand furniture industry. Due to limited exposure data there was considerable uncertainty in the estimates concerning construction woodworkers. About 560 000 workers (16 % of the exposed) may be exposed to a level exceeding 5 mgm 3. Mixed exposure to more than one species of wood and dust from wooden boards was very common, but reliable data on exposure to different species of wood could not be retrieved. This kind of assessment procedure integrating measurement data, company data, country-specific data and expert judgement could also serve as one model for the assessment of other occupational exposures...|$|R
