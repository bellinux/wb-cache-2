In {{order to}} master load {{magnitude}} a drum and its changes under lacking picks condition, {{find out the}} influence on drum loads when lacking picks on helical vanes, explore failure reasons of a shearer drum, a mathematical model of shearer drum loads was analyzed and established in the paper, using Matlab computer analysis program, drum loads and their changes under several conditions were simulated when lacking picks on helical vanes, and the influence to shearer <b>drum</b> <b>load</b> of lacking picks on different positions was analyzed. The results indicate that, the closer lacking pick position to the seam exposed surface, the smaller <b>drum</b> <b>load</b> fluctuation is when existing one lacking pick on helical vane; the load fluctuation and position angle of two lacking picks on the drum inversely proportional when existing two lacking picks on helical vane, which is roughly {{in accord with the}} actual situation...|$|E
40|$|Batch {{granulation}} {{experiments on}} a lab-scale drum granulator for a Calcite/Polyvinyl alcohol in water (Calcite/PVOH–H 2 O) system {{are presented in}} this study. Experimental {{studies were carried out}} to study the aggregation kinetics and mechanism for this granulation recipe, whilst investigating the effects of binder-to-solids ratio and <b>drum</b> <b>load</b> on the granule size, binder content and porosity distributions. In particular, the effect of formulation properties and the granulation operating conditions on the batch process dynamics and the end-granule properties are studied. The formulation properties considered include liquid surface tension, powder-liquid contact angle, dynamic yield stress, powder shape and liquid viscosity. The operating variables include the binder-to-solids ratio, binder addition duration and the binder addition mode. The sensitivity in the process and the non-homogeneity of key particle attributes (size, binder content, and porosity) is evident. The important process manipulations for feedback control and potential disturbances are identified, formulating a comprehensive control configuration for batch and continuous granulation, with the latter case being exemplified in Glaser et al. [T., Glaser, C. F. W., Sanders, F. Y., Wang, I. T., Cameron, R., Ramachandran, J. D., Litster, J. M. -H., Poon, C. D., Immanuel, F. J. Doyle, III, 2007. Model predictive control of drum granulation. Manuscript in preparation. ]. The importance of multi-scale process models that link fundamental material properties with the granulation mechanisms and end-granule properties is also evident from the experiments. A three-dimensional population balance equation structure in terms of the particle size, binder content and porosity is confirmed to be an ideal framework for the process model...|$|E
40|$|Mixing of {{granular}} solids is a processing {{step in a}} {{wide range}} of industries. The fundamental phenomena in granule mixing are still poorly understood, making it difficult to a priori predict the effectiveness of mixing processes. While mixing of granules is easy when the particles are homogeneous in size, shape and density and other properties, in practice they are not. With such a mixture, homogenizing is far more complex, since the heterogeneous particles tend to segregate, and special care has to be taken in the design of the mixing process to avoid this. In view of the practical need for better understanding and control of solids mixing, the work in this thesis has two closely coupled objectives. The first objective is to obtain a better understanding of segregation mechanisms. This insight should enable the enhancement of mixing and at the same time suppress segregation, or vice versa, namely the deliberate and controlled segregation of a mixture. The second objective is to provide guidelines for mixing operations that can be derived from insights extracted from the data on mixing behaviour at different rotational velocities and fill levels. From this perspective, we here report an extensive numerical study of mixing and segregation in a bed of bidisperse granules in a rotating horizontal drum, which is the simplest relevant geometry in industrial practice. Two types of segregation can occur: fast radial segregation during which smaller or denser particles accumulate along the axis of rotation; and slow axial segregation with fully segregated bands of small and large particles perpendicular to the rotating axis, with in general particle bands of large particles adjacent to the end walls. This thesis reports on both radial and axial segregation phenomena in a horizontally rotating drum. While visual observation of the particle bed was used as a qualitative observation technique to determine the degree of mixing/segregation, in parallel a more quantitative method was developed as well, which was based on calculating the entropy over the systems. By subdividing the system with a lattice, calculating the entropy of mixing in each cell of the lattice, and summarizing them over the system, a measure for the degree of overall segregation was obtained. By using different grids (a 3 D mesh, a 2 D set of slices perpendicular to the axis, or 2 D bars parallel to the axis), different types of segregation could be distinguished. The radial segregation dynamics were investigated in semi- 2 D (very short) drums, which inhibits axial segregation. Diagrams were prepared that visualise the mixing behaviour as function of the Froude number (rotational speed) for systems with different bidisperse systems. It was found that while almost all systems showed radial segregation at low Fr (rolling regime), and most showed inverted radial segregation at high Fr (cataracting or centrifuging regime), at Fr ≈ 0. 56 all systems became radially mixed. This could be understood by assuming a percolation mechanism. In the moving layer on top of the load, smaller particles percolate in between the moving larger particles, down to the centre of the load, as long as the motion is not too fast. The same phenomenon is inverted at high speeds. In between, the flowing layer is expanded in such a way that many large voids are present, which makes the percolation mechanism less selective on the particle size. The little segregation that occurs is negligible, since the two phenomena described above work in different directions. Surprisingly this transitional Fr number is the same for all investigated systems. Since axial segregation is always preceded by radial segregation, it is logical to also study axial segregation. This was done by studying longer drums, which allows axial segregation to develop along the axis. Axial segregation was found for most systems; its occurrence is mostly dictated by differences in size. It was found that for drums that have intermediate length, surprising dynamic behaviour results. The axial segregation developed with low and high frequency oscillations. While the low frequency oscillations could be understood as the development and migration of segregated areas in the system, the higher frequency oscillations, with a period of 10 to 20 revolutions, were not identified before. This oscillatory behaviour is probably coupled to the use of intermediately sized drums, as this behaviour has not been seen with very long drums. We ascribe the oscillations to the influence of the (vertical) end walls, which expose the adjacent particles to different forces than those particles inside the <b>drum</b> <b>load.</b> These differences induce an axial flow in the system. The particles adjacent to the vertical walls tend to be lifted higher than the particles far away from the vertical walls. This creates a concave profile of the load surface throughout the drum, inducing the particles (in the rolling regime) to follow a path away from the vertical walls towards the centre of the drum. Once past the centre, the particles flow back to the vertical walls in response to the locally convex bed profile. Even in this particular flow profile the percolation mechanism is of importance: smaller particles percolate through the flowing layer and end up deeper inside the bed, while the larger particles accumulate on top of the flowing layer and are conveyed back to the vertical walls. Due to the percolation of the small particles the final end configuration must clearly be a banding configuration of large-small-large particle bands. Prolonged rotation of the bed increases the concave form of the flowing layer. This induces fast oscillations and a sudden mixing of a part of the large particle band with the small particle band, giving fast mixing and leading to a configuration, in which a small-particle band is formed below the large-particles bands. Subsequently segregation into three bands (large-small-large) slowly occurs again, after which the asymmetry in the angel of repose further increases. The configuration, in which larger particles accumulate on top of the bed adjacent to the end walls, coincides with a minimum in energy dissipation, which is not present when the systems segregates radially or axially into three pure bands. The effect found implies that the end walls are important in the dynamics of axial segregation. This effect is studied further by varying the end wall properties. The above mentioned fast and slow oscillations vanish in systems that have smoother end walls, while also the rate of segregation decreases; nevertheless the same axially segregated three band (large-small-large) state of mixing resulted finally. Reducing the friction further to completely smooth end walls however changed the final configuration into a two-banded system. Systems with no end wall at all, simulated through periodic end walls, only gave radial segregation over the (considerable) simulated time span. We expect here that as long as there is still a driving force for axial segregation, the absence of the induction of axial flow by the end walls make the transition very slow or impossible. The formation of two axial bands lowers the energy dissipation by the bed, whereas neither radial segregation nor axial segregation into three bands reduced the power absorption at constant angular velocity. While the oscillatory behaviour is relevant in its own right, their study also allows shedding some light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying the segregation mechanisms, and especially the transition from radial to axial segregation. The fact that this is dependent on not only the properties of the granular materials, but also on the geometry and design of the drum, implies that these findings have relevance to the design and operation of processes...|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} at {{the heart}} of the Cookson repeater dates from 1680 and was originally known in Europe as the Lorenzoni System, named for Italian gunsmith Michele Lorenzoni of Florence. Long arms utilizing this system were produced in other European nations and in the United States until about 1849. The Cookson rifle dates from 1750 and features a two-chamber horizontally mounted rotating <b>drum.</b> <b>Loading</b> was accomplished by lowering a lever which was mounted on the left side of the rifle. This caused the chambers to line up with two magazines contained within the buttstock and allowed one [...]55 caliber lead ball and a 60-grain powder charge to fall into their respective chambers. When the lever was returned to its original position, the ball dropped into the chamber, and the powder charge lined up behind it. At the same time, the hammer was cocked, the pan was primed, and the frizzen was lowered. After firing the rifle, the process could be repeated until the two magazines, with their seven-shot capacities, were empty. Although other breech loading rifles were introduced in later years, the Cookson-type long arms were unique in their ability to fire multiple shots without reloading. Until the Nineteenth century, the only mechanism that could fire faster was the Kalthoff repeater, which was more delicate and expensive.|$|R

These results are then coupled with the inventory report to characterize the waste drum content. The inventory report is based on process knowledge of the waste <b>drum</b> <b>loading</b> and calculations of the isotopic distribution in the spent fuel examined to generate the drummed wastes.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a {{probabilistic safety assessment}} of radioactive doses as consequences from accident scenarios to complement the deterministic assessment presented in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The International Council of Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends both assessments be conducted to ensure that ''an adequate level of safety has been achieved and that no major contributors to risk are overlooked'' (ICRP 1993). To that end, the probabilistic assessment for the WIPP accident scenarios addresses {{the wide range of}} assumptions, e. g. the range of values representing the radioactive source of an accident, that could possibly have been overlooked by the SAR. Routine releases of radionuclides from the WIPP repository to the environment during the waste emplacement operations are expected to be essentially zero. In contrast, potential accidental releases from postulated accident scenarios during waste handling and emplacement could be substantial, which necessitates the need for radiological air monitoring and confinement barriers (DOE 1999). The WIPP Safety Analysis Report (SAR) calculated doses from accidental releases to the on-site (at 100 m from the source) and off-site (at the Exclusive Use Boundary and Site Boundary) public by a deterministic approach. This approach, as demonstrated in the SAR, uses single-point values of key parameters to assess the 50 -year, whole-body committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE). The basic assumptions used in the SAR to formulate the CEDE are retained for this report's probabilistic assessment. However, for the probabilistic assessment, single-point parameter values were replaced with probability density functions (PDF) and were sampled over an expected range. Monte Carlo simulations were run, in which 10, 000 iterations were performed by randomly selecting one value for each parameter and calculating the dose. Statistical information was then derived from the 10, 000 iteration batch, which included 5 %, 50 %, and 95 % dose likelihood, and the sensitivity of each assumption to the calculated doses. As one would intuitively expect, the doses from the probabilistic assessment for most scenarios were found to be much less than the deterministic assessment. The lower dose of the probabilistic assessment can be attributed to a ''smearing'' of values from the high and low end of the PDF spectrum of the various input parameters. The analysis also found a potential weakness in the deterministic analysis used in the SAR, a detail on <b>drum</b> <b>loading</b> was not taken into consideration. Waste emplacement operations thus far have handled drums from each shipment as a single unit, i. e. drums from each shipment are kept together. Shipments typically come from a single waste stream, and therefore the curie <b>loading</b> of each <b>drum</b> can be considered nearly identical to that of its neighbor. Calculations show that if there are large numbers of drums used in the accident scenario assessment, e. g. 28 drums in the waste hoist failure scenario (CH 5), then the probabilistic dose assessment calculations will diverge from the deterministically determined doses. As it is currently calculated, the deterministic dose assessment assumes one <b>drum</b> <b>loaded</b> to the maximum allowable (80 PE-Ci), and the remaining are 10 % of the maximum. The effective average of drum curie content is therefore less in the deterministic assessment than the probabilistic assessment for a large number of drums. EEG recommends that the WIPP SAR calculations be revisited and updated to include a probabilistic safety assessment...|$|R

All 35 crew and six DEMS gunners abandoned ship and took to the four lifeboats {{due to the nature of}} her cargo. At 00:08 on 25 April, U-136 fired a coup de grâce which hit amidships on the port side. Empire Drum quickly sank but the explosion wrecked one lifeboat, throwing its four occupants into the sea. They were rescued by one of the other lifeboats. U-136 surfaced and the survivors on board one of the lifeboats were questioned before the submarine left the scene.|$|R
5|$|McKagan first formed Loaded {{to be his}} touring band {{in support}} of his {{unreleased}} solo album Beautiful Disease. The first lineup included Michael Barragan (formerly of Plexi), Dez Cadena (formerly of Black Flag), and Taz Bentley (formerly of The Reverend Horton Heat). The band disbanded before the end of 1999. After working on new material with <b>drummer</b> Geoff Reading, <b>Loaded</b> was reformed in 2001, adding guitarist Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the line-up, though both were briefly replaced by guitarist Dave Kushner (Velvet Revolver, formerly of Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs) and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist (formerly of Asva and Burning Witch) in 2002.|$|R
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by <b>loading</b> <b>drums</b> of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Chemical Engineering Science and the definitive published version is available at [URL] have used speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS) and synchronized force measurements to compare the granular dynamics of two cohesive lactose powders, with Sauter mean diameters of ~ 29 and ~ 151 μm, in a rotating <b>drum.</b> A <b>load</b> cell (LC) {{was used to measure}} forces on the drum mounting frame and enable monitoring of bulk powder motion; SVS is a dynamic light scattering technique particularly suited for studying dynamics in dense, non-ergodic granular systems. Our results reveal that surface slumping and intermittent collisional dynamics in the bulk of the bed are correlated, especially for the fine more cohesive particles (Geldart group C/A boundary), but not as much for the less cohesive larger particles (Geldart group A/B boundary). The specific dissipation energy of the particles in the drum is similar for both powders, and increases linearly with increasing drum speed. However, the dependencies of the load cell and SVS signals on rotation speed have opposing trends for these two powders, indicating different dissipation mechanisms for the different Geldart Groups; collisional dissipation is more important for the Geldart C/A powder, while for the Geldart A/B powder avalanche dissipation is dominant...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for recording a data input on, a thermally processible storage medium. A light source, whose intensity is modulated {{in response to}} the incoming data input, generates a raster in conformance with incoming timing/control signals so as to expose a latent image of the input information on the storage medium. A rotating drum in conjunction with an incrementally driven lens carriage associated with the laser optical system provides the raster generation. The <b>drum</b> is automatically <b>loaded</b> with the storage medium from a supply means and automatically unloaded to a thermal processor upon completion of recording. The latent image is processed by the controlled application of heat so as to produce an actual displayable image corresponding to the data input at the output of the apparatus...|$|R
