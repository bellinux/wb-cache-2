40|$|Purpose We {{investigated}} the <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> of patients under local anesthesia who underwent insertion of a totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD). Methods Using semi-structured interviews, {{we conducted a}} qualitative exploratory study of 20 patients. The insertion procedure consisted of four successive phases. Immediately after TIVAD insertion, patients {{were asked to describe}} their <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> in the modalities hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste during each phase. Descriptions were documented in a Sensory Information Grid (SIG), which was composed of a row and column matrix of entries for the four phases of the procedure and the five sensory modalities. Verbatim descriptions of patients were assigned labels using a descriptive coding process. This approach is called the SIG-method. Results We found that patients experienced many <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> during the TIVAD procedure. <b>Sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> mainly occurred during preparation of the patient and surgical equipment (phase 2) and during the actual TIVAD insertion (phase 3). Patients perceived fewer olfactory sensations. No taste perceptions were mentioned. Conclusions Patients under local anesthesia reported numerous <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> during surgical TIVAD insertion. The use of the SIG-method emerged to be a suitable method for assessing and documenting patients’ <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Reported descriptions can be used in two ways: (1) to develop a structured questionnaire to quantitatively assess <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and (2) to prepare patients for what to expect with regard to sensory information experienced before, during, and after TIVAD insertion. This method for exploring and documenting <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> can be applied to other insertions or interventions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemicals}} on the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> in humans has received scant attention until now, but available data {{have shown that}} vision, hearing, smell, and taste can be affected by several chemicals, including pharmaceutical drugs, toxic metals, and various organic and inorganic compounds. The pathogenesis of the toxicity of chemicals to <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> {{can be related to}} an action on receptors, nerve fibers, and/or the brain. Even if evidence is incomplete, it is hypothesized that the decline of <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> with age can be, at least partly, related to chemical exposure...|$|R
50|$|The nervous {{damage is}} often the most {{problematic}} of the side effects to Erb's Palsy, {{but it is also}} the most varying. There have been cases of patients who have lost complete <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> within the arm after procedures whereas they had full <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> before. The most common area for a loss of <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> (except where the arm faces a total loss) is that between the shoulder and the elbow since the nerves which provide information from that area to the brain are also those first damaged in the initial causative trauma.|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{performed}} on wines {{have shown that}} nonvolatile and matrix components {{can have an impact}} on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> through physicochemical and/or sensory interactions. In distilled spirits and as for many other food products, relationships between these components and the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> are still misunderstood. In the present study, we investigated the impact of nonvolatile components on the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> of two 40 % (v/v) ethanol-containing French grape brandies with different compositions and sensory qualities. For this purpose, a reconstitution strategy involving freeze-drying was developed to test the contributions of nonvolatile components to the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> of brandies. The studied products contained different levels of nonvolatile components, and corresponding to extremes values of the nonvolatile components concentration range usually found in French grape brandies. Sensory results highlighted no significant sensory difference between the two reconstituted brandies. To validate results, sensory evaluations were also {{performed on}} model beverages and revealed that sugar and phenols at contents of between 5 - 25 g/L and 200 - 1, 000 mg/L, respectively, did not have an impact on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> It could therefore be hypothesized that physicochemical and sensory mechanisms involving ethanol, which is present in very large amounts in distilled beverages, can influence physicochemical interactions and <b>sensory</b> <b>perception,</b> and reduce the impact of nonvolatile components on final <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> Practical ApplicationsThis study reaffirmed the importance of aromatic perception to the global sensory image of brandies: perception differences between French grape brandies seemed to be mainly due to differences in their volatile composition. This composition depends on aroma compound formation and selection steps in the global production process of the product, such as fermentation and distillation. Product characteristics, especially their 40 % v/v ethanol content, can modify <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> and possibly hide the effects of some nonvolatile components. The latter are known to highly contribute to the sensory profile of alcoholic drinks with lower ethanol content such as wine. This study also highlighted an interesting strategy to test the role of each sensory component on overall <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> and to draw conclusions about the perception complexity of beverages such as brandies...|$|R

40|$|Many {{athletes are}} treated with hot and cold {{modalities}} prior to therapeutic exercise, but {{the effects of these}} treatments on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> are not clear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of hot and cold treatments on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> We recruited 21 volunteer subjects, who reported for testing on three separate occasions. One of three treatments was applied to the left ankle and foot each day for 20 minutes: cold immersion, hot immersion, or quiet sitting (control). Three variables were measured following treatment: topagnosis, two-point discrimination, and one-legged balance. We assigned treatments and the testing order according to a Greco Latin square. Data were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). No significant differences were detected for the three dependent measures, suggesting that therapeutic applications of heat and cold do not affect <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> These findings indicate that heat and cold applications can be used prior to therapeutic exercise programs without interfering with normal <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> as do other analgesic and anesthetic agents.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} role of partial {{coalescence}} of whey protein-stabilized emulsions on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> The selection of fats was restricted to vegetable fats that are essentially melted at oral temperatures. The sensitivity to partial coalescence was controlled by {{a variation in the}} fat melting curve and by addition of unsaturated monoglyceride. Most fat-related sensory attributes appear to be well-correlated to an increase in viscosity and coalescence in the mouth due to partial coalescence. Moreover, it was found that in-mouth aeration induces extra coalescence, which increases the <b>perception</b> of fat-related <b>sensory</b> attributes significantly. Monoglyceride addition induces a shift of the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> of fattiness and other fat-related attributes. There are clear indications that monoglyceride addition affects <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> not only by promoting partial coalescence, but also by an additional effect such as its surface activity...|$|R
40|$|Food oral {{processing}} as {{the bridge}} between food texture, microstructure and <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> has gained enormous {{interest in the}} last decade. This review {{provides an overview of}} the role of the microstructure of soft- and semi-solid foods in food oral processing and <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> Phase separated mixed protein polysaccharide gels and emulsion-filled gels are described as suitable model foods to investigate food oral processing systematically. Special attention is given to the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> of texture, taste and interactions thereof. Several approaches to reduce the salt and sugar content of semi- and soft-solid foods without compromising taste are reviewed. These reduction approaches are based on an understanding of food oral processing in relation to the microstructure of the foods and its breakdown. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|In {{neuroscience}} {{the bridge}} locus {{for a particular}} sensory percept is a hypothetical set of neurons whose activity {{is the basis of}} that sensory percept. The term was introduced by D.N. Teller and E.Y. Pugh, Jr. in 1983, and has been sparingly used. Activity in the bridge locus neurons is postulated to be necessary and sufficient for sensory perception: if the bridge locus neurons are not active, then the <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> does not occur, regardless of the actual sensory input. Conversely if the bridge locus neurons are active, then <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> occurs, regardless of the actual sensory input. It is the highest neural level of a <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> So, for example, retinal neurons are not considered a bridge locus for visual perception because stimulating visual cortex can give rise to visual percepts.|$|R

40|$|Until recently, Cartesian {{scholars}} have not read Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s {{thoughts about the}} faculty of imagination with much vigor or interest. In particular, Cartesian scholars often ignore Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s arguments concerning imagination in his Meditations on First Philosophy. However, as I show in this work, Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts about the faculty of imagination affect the interpretation of his larger epistemic project. Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s hesitatingly attributing the faculty of imagination to his mind in Med. II reveals that his initial skepticism about <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> goes well beyond the banal doubts that his <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> might merely be imaginings. In fact, as I demonstrate, Descartes does not fully accept either <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> or imagination as real faculties of his mind in Med. II. Not until Med. V does Descartes fully accept that his faculty of imagination is genuine faculty of thought. This skepticism, I argue, is due to his doubting that the modes of imagination and <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> produce materially true ideas. ^ Most importantly, Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s arguments concerning imagination in Med. IV, long ignored as interesting asides, do play specific roles in dampening the narrator 2 ̆ 7 s skeptical worries regarding his knowledge of external corporeal substances. More specifically, Descartes 2 ̆ 7 s arguments regarding {{the relation between the}} essence of thought and the faculty of imagination is a necessary step towards concluding that corporeal objects exist as the objects of his <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions.</b> ...|$|R
