25|$|Some {{complications}} of arachnoid cysts can occur when a cyst is damaged because of minor head trauma. Trauma {{can cause the}} fluid within a cyst to leak into other areas (e.g., subarachnoid space). Blood vessels {{on the surface of}} a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (<b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage),</b> increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a collection of blood (hematoma) may result. In the cases of <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (neural) tissue.|$|E
50|$|Neuroepithelial cysts, {{also known}} as colloid cysts, develop in {{individuals}} {{between the ages of}} 20 and 50 and is relatively rare in individuals under the age of twenty. The cysts are benign tumors that usually appear in the anterior third ventricle. The cysts occur in the epithelium putting their patients at risk for obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, and rarely <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> This results from the cysts enlarging by causing the epithelium to secrete additional mucinous fluid. The cysts are usually found incidentally or if patients become symptomatic presenting with the symptoms of hydrocephalus. The larger cysts are operated on while smaller cysts that are not obstructive can be left alone.|$|E
50|$|Ovarian {{masses in}} {{children}} are typically cystic, but 1% are malignant ovarian cancers. 30-70% of neonates with ovaries have cysts; they {{are caused by}} transplacental hormones in utero or by the postnatal spike in gonadotropins. Neonatal ovarian cysts usually affect one ovary, do not cause symptoms, are classed as simple, and disappear {{by the age of}} 4 months. In rare cases, neonatal ovarian cysts may result in ovarian torsion, autoamputation of the ovary, <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> rupture, and compression of surrounding organs. Cysts smaller than 5 centimeters in diameter may be monitored with ultrasonography; larger cysts are more likely to cause complications are either drained by percutaneous aspiration or surgically removed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{atypical}} imaging manifestations of branchial cleft cysts (BCCs) confirmed by pathology. Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 17 BCC cases were reviewed. The imaging features, including laterality, location, border, attenuation and internal architecture, were evaluated. All 17 cases were second BCCs, including 5 cases of Bailey type classification cysts and 12 cases of type classification cysts. The atypical imaging features included signal and morphological abnormalities. The abnormal signal intensities were caused by intracapsular bleeding (n= 2) or solidification of cystic fluid (n= 2). <b>Intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhaging</b> revealed homogeneous hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted image (T 1 WI) and T 2 ‑weighted image (T 2 WI). Solidification of cystic fluid revealed slightly homogeneous hyperinten-sity compared with muscle on T 1 WI and homogeneous hypointensity on T 2 WI without enhancement. The aberrant morphology mainly presented as thickening of the cystic wall (n= 13). Thickened walls of BCCs with ill ‑ (n= 5) or well ‑ (n= 8) defined borders were observed in 13 patients. In 3 patients, significant enhancement was identified following intravenous gadolinium administration (n= 4). When with atypical CT or MRI features are presented, the typical location of BCCs can help in the diagnosis, as it is located at the lateral portion of the neck adjacent to the anterior border of the mandibular angle or sternocleidomastoid muscle. The atypical observa-tions, including variable signals, imply that the cystic content has changed. Thickened walls indicate inflammation or cancerous tendency and patients with ill‑defined margins, vascular involvement or lymphadenopathy atelectasis indi-cate malignant conversion...|$|R

40|$|Colloid cysts are benign tumors {{situated}} in {{and connected to}} the roof of the third ventricle. The clinical presentation is diverse, varying from incidentally found cysts to acute death. This presentation is explained by an acute hydrocephalus due to an obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow {{at the level of the}} foramina of Monro. Why these lesions cause a sudden obstruction is not clear in most cases. Possible explanations of a sudden deterioration are shifts of the cysts after lumbar puncture or CSF flow obstruction after shunt dysfunction. We add an explanation for the acute deterioration of patients with colloid cysts (ie, hemorrhagic changes in the cysts). This complication has been published only 4 times before, all diagnosed at postmortem examination. A young patient is presented with a recently diagnosed and symptomatic colloid cyst who deteriorated the night before surgery because of <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Despite emergent CSF diversion, our patient remained in a poor clinical condition.

40|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy in}} a major {{depression}} patient with arachnoid cyst Arachnoid cyst develops when two layers of arachnoid membrane fail to unite in early fetal life causing cerebrospinal fluid accumulation and formation of a cyst. Arachnoid cysts constitute 1 % of space occupying lesions in the brain. Diagnosis is made usually with regular medical examinations. They can cause epilepsy, increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, macrocranium and growth deficit in children, and subdural hematoma. It has been recommended to be careful when administrating Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to the patients with space occupying lesions. ECT can cause adverse effects in patients with arachnoid cyst by increasing intracranial pressure. Arachnoid cyst can rupture and give symptoms by causing subdural effusion, subdural hemorrhage or <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> In this case, we diagnosed major depression and arachnoid cyst. We administered ECT to the patient who had suicide ideation and was resistant to pharmacotherapy. Patient’s complaints fully recovered with ECT.

An asymptomatic 56 -year-old woman underwent a complete medical checkup in a health-care center. Her chest X-ray showed an unusually large bulge on the left cardiac border, and she was referred to our hospital. The chest X-ray taken 2 years ago in another hospital showed similar bulge on the same left cardiac border, but it was noticeably smaller. Chest CT revealed a 9. 5 × 4. 5 cm pericardial cyst within the anterolateral aspect of the left cardiac border. The CT number of the mass was approximately 15 - 20 HU. The mass also showed slight hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted MR images and hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted MR images.

Case report We report the case of a 76 -year-old woman who presented with nausea. Imaging studies revealed a cystic mass {{in the body of the}} pancreas. She underwent a successful distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and has subsequently remained well. Microscopically, the cyst was lined by columnar epithelium similar to pancreatic duct epithelium, and the nodular projection consisted of arborizing papillary structures, lined by plump cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. These eosinophilic cells were immunohistochemically positively stained with anti-mitochondrial antibody. The cellular atypism was mild and the proliferat-ing index was low, compatible with adenoma of an intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm. Although no ovarian type stroma was identified, in our case, no communication to main pancreatic duct (located in the pancreatic body) and rapid growth by <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> were clinical characteristics of a mucinous cystic neoplasm, but not IPMN.

40|$|Aim of the Study: We propose some {{technique}} {{devices for}} treating simple renal cysts with percutaneous puncture (PCN) to reduce recurrences. Materials and Methods: Between January 1995 and December 1998, {{a series of}} 42 patients, 13 females and 29 males, ranging in age between 49 and 73 were treated for symptomatic kidney cystic disease. The cysts varied between 7. 4 and 13. 6 cm in diameter and from 100 to 570 cm(3) in volume. This technique consists of echo-guided emptying of the cyst, and slowly inserting a quantity of pure 95 % ethanol, equivalent to about 1 / 3 of the cyst volume, into the cavity. This acts as a sclerosant agent on the cyst walls. The protocol of this technique also includes positioning a curled drainage catheter, for 24 - 48 h, in suction, to ensure a correct collapse of the cyst walls and to avoid cyst recurrence. Results: Of the 42 patients treated, only 4 did not complete the protocol. In 3 cases, the patients {{were not able to}} stand the procedure because of intense pain during cyst filling with alcohol. The other patient had <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> The results were evaluated by ultrasonography at 7 days post-operatively and then at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months later. There was a further follow-up lasting from 12 to 36 months. Of 38 patients treated, 29 (76 %) did not have any recurrence. 8 patients (21 %) developed a small liquid layer of 3 - 4 cm, which did not enlarge in subsequent check-ups. We observed a recurrence, which spontaneously reduced in volume, only in 1 patient. Conclusions: This procedure was simple to apply in an out-patient setting and used low-cost materials which are easily obtained. Moreover, the results appear to confirm the validity of this technique. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Intracranial {{arachnoid}} cysts {{have been}} found in 0. 3 % of computed tomography (CT) scans and in 0. 1 % of brain autopsy specimens, more often in children than in adults. Intracranial arachnoid cysts occur prevalently in males, on the left side, and in the temporal fossa. Their occasional association with other hereditary disorders suggests a genetic factor. The majority of temporal arachnoid cysts are of small size and remain so; large arachnoid cysts appear to exhibit a tendency to grow. Communication studies have suggested an inverse correlation between the size of the cyst and the extent of communication with surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. The small cysts, in particular, tend to be asymptomatic. Symptomatology may be aspecific, such as headache and epileptic seizures, or focal, including hemiparesis. Progressive symptoms of increased intracranial pressure {{may be the result of}} expansion of the cyst, <b>intracystic</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> progressing to subdural hemorrhage (especially with temporal fossa cysts), or obstructive hydrocephalus (associated with cysts at the posterior fossa and intraventricular locations). In children, the presenting symptoms are usually enlargement of the head, seizures, and developmental retardation. In the elderly, arachnoid cysts may present with the symptoms common to normal pressure hydrocephalus. On CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans arachnoid cysts have a fluid content identical to CSF, and they are typically extraaxially located. Temporal fossa arachnoid cysts of medium size may show the typical straight-edged triangular or rectangular shape. Communication studies are recommended in the management of arachnoid cysts at the less frequent locations. Intraaxial cysts containing CSF-like fluid, which are not of the ex vacuo type in our classification, may be arachnoid or neuroepithelial cysts, and histological verification of biopsy specimens, including immunocytochemical studies and electron microscopy, may be required. Indications for treatment are the progression of symptoms, and the presence of severe functional disorders, such as hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and endocrinological dysfunction. In children, enlargement of the head and the space-occupying nature of the cyst, which interferes with brain development, may be considered indications for intervention.
