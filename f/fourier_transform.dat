(A practical <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E

50|$|A key {{advantage}} of OFDM is that fast <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> (FFTs) {{may be used}} to simplify implementation. <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> convert signals {{back and forth between the}} time domain and frequency domain. Consequently, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> can exploit the fact that any complex waveform may be decomposed into a series of simple sinusoids. In signal processing applications, discrete <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> (DFTs) are used to operate on real-time signal samples. DFTs may be applied to composite OFDM signals, avoiding the need for the banks of oscillators and demodulators associated with individual subcarriers. Fast <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> are numerical algorithms used by computers to perform DFT calculations.|$|R
40|$|The {{derivation}} of {{a linear}} transform kernel for fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> is presented.

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform.</b> This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) in order to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E

By means of alternating multivariate exponential functions three types of <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> are constructed: expansions into corresponding Fourier series, integral <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms,</b> and multivariate finite <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms.</b> Alternating multivariate exponential functions are used as a kernel in all these <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms.</b> Eigenfunctions of the integral <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> are obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of hypercomplex <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> and wavelets {{has taken place}} in several different threads, reflected in the overview of the subject presented in this chapter. We present in Section 1 an overview of the {{development of}} quaternion <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms,</b> then in Section 2 the development of Clifford <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms.</b> Finally, since wavelets are a more recent development, and the distinction between their quaternion and Cliord algebra approach has been much less pronounced than in the case of <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms,</b> Section 3 reviews the history of both quaternion and Clifford wavelets...|$|R
5|$|The intensities of the {{reflections}} observed in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E
25|$|Actually, {{fractional}} <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> is {{a rotation}} operation {{on the time}} frequency distribution. From the definition above, for α=0, {{there will be no}} change after applying fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> and for α=π/2, fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> becomes a <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> which rotates the time frequency distribution withπ/2. For other value ofα, fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> rotates the time frequency distribution according to α. The following figure shows the results of the fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> with different values ofα.|$|E
25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> such as the short-time <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> or fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E

In many cases, the evaluation of these <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> seems intractable, but for SL 2, the nilpotent orbital integrals have already been computed.

25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> of {{the square}} wave generates a {{frequency}} spectrum that presents {{the magnitude of the}} harmonics that make up the square wave (the phase is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not plotted). The <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> {{can also be used to}} analyze non-periodic functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> is almost always computed using the Fast <b>Fourier</b> <b>Transform</b> (FFT) computer algorithm in combination with a window function.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{complete}} set of Hermite functions provides {{a resolution of the}} identity, the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed. This approach to define the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> was first done by Norbert Wiener. Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform,</b> namely the fractional <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> used in time-frequency analysis. In physics, this transform was introduced by Edward Condon.|$|E

Similarly, the Ad(G) -orbit of a regular element of g is not a set of synthesis for the algebra of <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> on g.

25|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between the}} compaction of a function and its <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> can be formalized {{in the form}} of an uncertainty principle by viewing a function and its <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> as conjugate variables with respect to the symplectic form on the time–frequency domain: from the point of view of the linear canonical transformation, the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> is rotation by 90° in the time–frequency domain, and preserves the symplectic form.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> {{can also}} be defined for {{functions}} on a non-abelian group, provided that the group is compact.

40|$|By {{adopting}} a concept from signal processing, instead of {{starting from the}} correlation functions which are even, one considers the causal correlation functions whose <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> become complex. Their real and imaginary parts multiplied by 2 are the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> of the original correlations and the subsequent Hilbert transforms, respectively. Thus, by taking this step one can complete the two previously needed transforms. However, to obviate performing the Cauchy principal integrations required in the Hilbert transforms is the greatest advantage. Meanwhile, because the causal correlations are well-bounded within the time domain and band limited in the frequency domain, one can replace their <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> by the discrete <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> and the latter {{can be carried out}} with the FFT algorithm. This replacement is justified by sampling theory because the <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> can be derived from the discrete <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> with the Nyquis rate without any distortions. We apply this method in calculating pressure induced shifts of H 2 O lines and obtain more reliable values. By comparing the calculated shifts with those in HITRAN 2008 and by screening both of them with the pair identity and the smooth variation rules, one can conclude many of shift values in HITRAN are not correct...|$|R
