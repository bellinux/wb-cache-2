500|$|The {{first piece}} of {{evidence}} consists of three small objects which contain both of their praenomen next to one another: the aforementioned small glass bead, a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, {{all of which are}} written in the proper style for the early 18th dynasty. The last stele said that Amenhotep was [...] "given life eternally", which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet [...] "true of voice" [...] which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Crane's {{fiction is}} {{typically}} categorized {{as representative of}} Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. [...] Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, [...] "Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo," [...] that the work presents a [...] "symbiosis" [...] of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. [...] When asked {{whether or not he}} would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he [...] "dare not say that I am honest. [...] <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow." [...] Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting—including the use of color and chiaroscuro—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. [...] H. G. Wells remarked upon [...] "the great influence of the studio" [...] on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: [...] "At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects." [...] Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that [...] "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. [...] Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true." ...|$|E

2500|$|Located a {{few miles}} from the mouth of the Calycadnus (Greek: Kalykadnos, {{currently}} Göksu) River, Seleucia was founded by Seleucus I Nicator in the early 3rd century BCE, one of several cities he named after himself. It is probable that there were already towns called Olbia (or Olba) and Hyria and that Seleucus <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> united them giving them his name. The city grew to include the nearby settlement of Holmi (in modern-day Taşucu) which had been established earlier as an Ionian colony but being on the coast was vulnerable to raiders and pirates. [...] The new city up river was doubtless seen as safer against attacks from the sea so Seleucia achieved considerable commercial prosperity as a port for this corner of Cilicia (later named Isauria), and was even a rival of Tarsus.|$|E
2500|$|Horthy was {{captured}} by Veesenmayer and his staff later on the 15th and taken to the Waffen SS office, where he was held overnight. [...] Vessenmayer told Horthy that unless he recanted the armistice and abdicated, his son would be killed the next morning. [...] The fascist Arrow Cross Party swiftly took over Budapest. [...] With his son's life in the balance, Horthy consented to sign a document officially abdicating his office and naming Ferenc Szálasi, leader of the Arrow Cross, as his successor. [...] Horthy understood that the Germans merely wanted the stamp of his prestige on a Nazi-sponsored Arrow Cross coup, but he signed anyway. As he later explained his capitulation: [...] "I neither resigned nor appointed Szálasi Premier. <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> exchanged my signature for my son's life.

2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> thought it was another checkpoint.

Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
2500|$|.....a sudden {{temperature}} inversion {{must have taken}} place. The cold and warm air masses could conceivably propel that rotating air lens in an elliptical orbit first toward the earth, and then push it up, {{as if it were}} a boomerang, back to its original position. Meanwhile the ice crystals in it acted as so many means of refraction for the sun’s rays... Only one observer, a lawyer, stated three decades later that the path of descent and ascent was elliptical with small circles superimposed on it. Such an observation would make eminent sense to anyone familiar with fluid dynamics or even with the workings of a boomerang. There is indeed plenty of scientific information on hand to approach the miracle of the sun scientifically... The carefully co-ordinated interplay of so many physical factors would by itself be a miracle, even if one does not wish to see anything more in what actually happened. Clearly, the “miracle” of the sun was not a mere meteorological phenomenon, however rare. Otherwise it would have been observed before and after, regardless of the presence of devout crowds or not. <b>I</b> <b>merely</b> claim, which I did in my other writings on miracles, that in producing miracles God often makes use of a natural substratum by greatly enhancing its physical components and their interactions.|$|E
