5000|$|The Keyboard Component {{added an}} 8-bit 6502 {{processor}} making the Intellivision a <b>dual</b> <b>processor</b> <b>computer.</b> It had 16K 10-bit shared RAM that could load and execute both Intellivision CP1610 and 6502 program code from tape; {{a large amount}} as typical cartridges of the day were 4K. The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer. Two tracks are read only for the software, and two tracks for user data. The tape-drive was block addressed with high speed indexing. A high resolution 40x24 monochrome text display could overlay regular Intellivision graphics. There was an input for a microphone and two expansion ports for peripherals and RAM expansion. [...] The Microsoft BASIC programming cartridge used one of these ports. Expanded memory cartridges could support 1000 8KB pages. A third pass-through cartridge port was for regular Intellivision cartridges. It uses the Intellivision's power supply. A 40-column thermal printer was available, and a telephone modem was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition.|$|E

40|$|We give {{a formal}} {{specification}} for a strategic network routing problem {{known as the}} convoy movement problem (CMP) and establish that the corresponding feasibility problem is NP-complete. We then introduce an integer programming (IP) model based {{on the concept of}} a time-space network and apply a Lagrangian relaxation to this model. We discuss how the dual function may be evaluated using a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm suitable to very large, implicitly defined graphs and show how heuristic solutions to the primal problem may be obtained. We present results for a number of instances of the CMP, most of which are based on real-world problems. The number of convoys in these instances varies between 15 – 25, and their movement time requires up to several thousand time units in networks ranging in size from a few dozen to several thousand vertices and edges. The most difficult instance tested involves 17 long convoys each taking four times the average link travel time to pass through a point in the network. This instance is solved within 3. 3 % of optimality in less than 3. 5 hours of computing time on a Dell Precision 420 <b>dual</b> <b>processor</b> <b>computer.</b> Every other test instance is solved within 2 % of the optimal value in less than 20 minutes of computing time...|$|E

We also discuss its platform-independent implementation with OpenMP and finally present the results of experiments performed on a <b>dual</b> <b>processor</b> Pentium III <b>computer</b> running under Linux operating system with Altas as an efficient implementation of BLAS. The sequential version of the algorithm is up to 2. 5 times faster than a simple sequential algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated {{the potential of}} multi-pinhole coded apertures when {{used in conjunction with}} compact pixelated detectors for high resolution, high sensitivity small animal SPECT. We are now constructing a prototype SPECT system with three such detectors mounted on a rotating gantry. Each detector comprises a 12 cm diameter circular array of NaI(Tl) crystals, each 1 /spl times/ 1 /spl times/ 5 mm/sup 3 / on a 1. 25 mm pitch. Each crystal array is coupled to a Hamamatsu R 3292 12. 7 cm diameter PS-PMT. Signals from the three detectors are read out by a custom subtractive resistive circuit and multiplexed. Data are acquired by a National Instruments PCI- 6110 E board running on a Macintosh <b>dual</b> <b>processor</b> G 4 <b>computer</b> under Kmax software control. Images are reconstructed using a 3 D iterative MAP-EM algorithm based on a multi-pinhole forward and back projector. The trade-off between contrast and variance was studied by simulation for a number of multi-pinhole configurations. We also performed initial planar imaging studies on one of the detectors. Our results indicate that spatial resolution approaching 1 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) can be achieved with a single pinhole aperture, while improved contrast and variance may result from using optimized multi-pinhole apertures...|$|R
