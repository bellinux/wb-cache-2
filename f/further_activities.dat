A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, overseas educational visits and <b>further</b> <b>activities</b> run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media, and a professional development scheme for educators. A digital archive of the project, online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Further</b> <b>activities</b> of Operation Labrador were {{abandoned}} in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated {{documents related to}} the operation. The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents who were part of the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia. Those in custody were acquitted, while those tried in absentia were convicted.|$|E

500|$|Jape's debut album, Cosmosphere, was {{released}} on the Volta Sounds label in 2003. National broadcaster RTÉ suggested in its review that Jape was not a [...] "convincing electronic producer" [...] and that Egan {{did not have the}} voice of a singer-songwriter, indicating its desire to see him remain with The Redneck Manifesto and refrain from any <b>further</b> <b>activities</b> under the pseudonym Jape. However, the album received airplay on national radio on shows such as Donal Dineen's Here Comes the Night on Today FM.|$|E

2500|$|Rytas {{was told}} that no schools would be {{approved}} if they were less than [...] from a public Polish school and instead concentrated on reestablishing local chapters and reading rooms. From June to August, Rytas established 103 chapters with about 1,500 members. <b>Further</b> <b>activities</b> were interrupted by World War II. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Vilnius Region was occupied by the Soviet Union and then partially transferred to Lithuania in October according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Due to wartime disruptions and regime changes, the society was not active. It registered with the Lithuanian government in February 1940 and called a general meeting in March searching for a new mission – {{a lot of its}} functions were taken over by the Lithuanian government and it could no longer rely on funding from the government or the public. Rytas, along with other Lithuanian organizations, was abolished by the new Soviet regime following the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The last board meeting of Rytas took place on 6 July 1940.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of his {{financial}} peregrinations amongst the highways and byways of the city, Mr. Dane Montague made many acquaintances. It chanced that soon after the exploitation of the Shoreditch Empress Music Hall, a flotation which brought Mr. Montague many admirers from the underworlds of finance, it fell to his lot to give a luncheon party to celebrate the culmination of a subsidiary financial swindle and to plan <b>further</b> <b>activities</b> in the same direction. His guests were Philip Mason, the well-known man about town, and Joe Hartwell, the trans-atlantic young adventurer. After the third bottle of champagne, it transpired that the luncheon party had a further object.|$|E

60|$|Something of {{the same}} shadow of prophecy is perhaps the deepest memory left by the last war of Kitchener before the greatest. After <b>further</b> <b>activities</b> in Egypt and the Soudan, of which the attempt to educate the Fellaheen by the Gordon Memorial College was the most remarkable, he was {{abruptly}} summoned to South Africa {{to be the right}} hand of Lord Roberts in the war then being waged against the Boers. He conducted the opening of the determining battle of Paardeberg, and was typically systematic in covering the half-conquered country with a system of block-houses and enclosures like a diagram of geometry. But to-day, and for many reasons, Englishmen will think first of the last scene of that war. When Botha and the Boer Generals surrendered to Kitchener, there was the same goodwill among the soldiers to contrast with the ill-will of the journalists. Botha also became almost a friend; and Botha also was to be in the far future an ally, smiting the German in Africa as Kitchener smote him in Europe. There was the same hint of prophecy about the war that ended at Vereeniging as about that other war that so nearly began at Fashoda. It seemed almost as if God were pitting his heroes against each other in tournament, before they all rode together against the heathen pouring upon them out of Germany.|$|E
