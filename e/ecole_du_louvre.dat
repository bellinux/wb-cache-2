5000|$|Haywood “Bill” Rivers {{was born}} in Morven, North Carolina on May 8, 1922. He {{attended}} the Art Students League of New York from 1946-1949 and then continued his training at the <b>École</b> <b>du</b> Musée <b>du</b> <b>Louvre</b> in Paris [...] With funding from the Rosenwald Foundation, Rivers opened Galerie Huit, and exhibition space for American artists in Paris, which he managed along with his partners Al Held and Jules Oltski, for five years. [...] Some of the gallery’s exhibitors included Edward Clark (artist), Herbert Gentry, and Paul Keene. Rivers’ early works demonstrate his familiarity with French modernists and their tendencies toward figural simplification, planarity, and non-illusionism; however, {{when he returned to}} the United States, he adopted a non-objectivist approach to painting and was strongly influenced by the styles of African American artists, Jacob Lawrence and Horace Pippin. [...] Certain elements remained steadfast in Rivers’ work, such as his heavy and vigorous application of pigment onto the canvas, formidable displays of color, and themes from his youth in North Carolina ...|$|R

25|$|She {{first came}} to Ireland in 1926 while {{starting}} a thesis for the <b>École</b> <b>du</b> <b>Louvre</b> on Irish medieval carving.

She published La sculpture irlandaise pendant les douze premiers siècles de l'ère chrétienne in 1933, with a dedication to Focillon. The volume was recognised as the primary reference immediately.
