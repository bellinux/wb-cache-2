40|$|In 2013, the Estrela {{report on}} sexual and {{reproductive}} health and rights bore {{witness to the}} growing politicization of abortion at the EU level. The report raised debates {{over the meaning of}} the secular – but not value-free – notions of subsidiarity and human dignity. Subsidiarity refers to the formal competences of the EU; human dignity refers to the human right component of the abortion issue. The paper studies the framing strategies developed through the subsidiarity and human dignity frames during the Estrela debate. The purpose is twofold: firstly, to determine how and why European actors referred to them; secondly, to explore the effects of the politics of meaning and the interplay between conflict and consensus. The American culture war literature offers a heuristic schema which helps to explain the role of framing strategies in the contest for public morality. The study relies on a content analysis of a sample of 28 policy papers and press releases published by five European interest groups (COMECE, the FAFCE, EDW, the EHF and the EPF) and by the <b>European</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>initiative</b> One of Us. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|While {{extensive}} communication {{around the}} sustainability challenges have {{lead to increased}} awareness, the expected behavior change correspondent to that level of awareness has not been observed. After decades of information-based sustainability communication the research community recognizes values as important drivers of peoples behavior. Consequently, communication needs to be designed intentionally, so as to implement the change {{necessary in order to}} shift society to a sustainable level where the global community lives within the planetary boundaries. This thesis was inspired by this call from the field of sustainability science for a new narrative around sustainability that would inspire more radical change. In the first step we used the <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> ́ <b>Initiative</b> for an Unconditional Basic Income (EUBI) as a case study, to analyze what types of values the current narrative of the EUBI speaks to and compare that with the values {{of the population of the}} European Union. In the second step our research focused on what types of Guidelines could be developed so as to intentionally design a values-oriented narrative. We identified three ways in which the narrative of EUBI is misaligned with the values of the population of the European Union. We identified as well 13 Guidelines for designing a values-oriented narrative that could contribute in moving society strategically towards sustainability. When utilizing the Guidelines as a tool in crafting a potentially more successful narrative as part of a new sustainability communication, the contribution to SSD may be to strategically overcome the above described misalignment and inspiring more action to bridge the gap...|$|R
40|$|In the {{backdrop}} of depopulation and the participation society, <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives</b> in rural areas are expected to contribute to community liveability by maintaining various types of facilities in the area. Studies on which factors influence {{the success or failure}} of <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives</b> have thus far neglected to conceptualize what actually is regarded as successful or unsuccessful, although it is relevant to have a clear expectation of what <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives</b> can achieve, and when and in which sense they can be called successful (or not). Is a financially independent <b>citizen</b> <b>initiative</b> more successful than an initiative that represents the wishes of an entire community? Or can a <b>citizen</b> <b>initiative</b> only be successful if it achieves the goals that were initially set? This study aims to conceptualize determinants of success and failure of rural <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives</b> from the perspective of professionals in the field of depopulating rural areas. Three focus group discussions were conducted with in total 23 experts from local governments, housing corporations or consultancy bureaus in the North of the Netherlands. The resulting conceptualization will add to future research in studying factors influencing success or failure of <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Furthermore, it may improve evaluations of the achievements of the <b>citizen</b> <b>initiatives</b> and classifications of various types of initiatives...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{take stock of}} the EU's most recent {{democratic}} innovation, the <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ECI). In doing so we adopt a threefold strategy. First, we unpack the institutional features of the ECI to situate it within a broader universe of relatively well understood mechanisms of direct democracy. Second, {{on the basis of}} an inventory of all ECI initiatives to date, we present some general trends regarding its use and functioning. The third, more speculative, analysis looks at possible institutional trajectories for the ECI based on our largely comparative analysis. Our findings suggest that the ECI is far from being unique and that {{some of the problems that}} surround its functioning are common to other systems. In addition, despite its novelty, we can already detect some general patterns as well as indirect effects on member states. Whether the instrument could ever fulfill its democratic potential remains very much an open question however. The evidence thus far presents a mixed picture...|$|E
40|$|On 10 May 2017, the General Court of the European Union in T- 754 / 14 annulled a European Commission {{decision}} refusing {{the registration}} {{of a proposed}} <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ECI). The proposal had as its objective to prevent negotiations on an international agreement between the EU and US and EU and Canada, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and EU-Canada Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), for reasons relating to the procedures for the resolution of disputes between investors and States and its provisions on regulatory cooperation because they were alleged to threaten democracy {{and the rule of}} law. An ECI allows EU citizens to request the Commission to consider an idea as a possible basis for a legislative procedural pursuant to Article 11 (4) TEU, Article 24 TFCEU and Regulation 211 / 2011. The Regulation affords organisers of an ECI one year to collect one million signatories from seven different Member States.

40|$|The catastrophic nuclear {{incident}} in Fukushima in March 2011 has shocked Europe. Its impact was particularly strong in Germany with its decade-old anti-nuclear movements. Political and technological re-orientations were initiated {{in that country}} without considering at any depth the potential of European law and politics to control or obstruct such moves. Somewhat paradoxically, the Euratom Treaty of 1957 and also the new Treaty of Lisbon confirm the right of each Member State to decide upon {{the use of nuclear}} energy autonomously. This means that European citizens remain exposed to the risks of that technology until the highly unlikely consent of all Member States to abstain from its further use. That constellation poses a dilemma for democracy because it implies that each political decision taken within parts of the Union exerts external pan-European effects. The article considers the chances for an inclusive democratic process which would lead to a legitimated European decision. It examines the possibilities offered by the new <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Initiative</b> which the Lisbon Treaty has institutionalized in its Article 12 and concludes that this instrument could indeed be used to instigate a European-wide debate which may eventually lead to pertinent changes in the Treaties...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20 th century, the {{political}} influence of unions relied on strong ties to labour-friendly sister parties. Since the 1990 s, however, the coalitions between centre-left parties and unions have deteriorated, forcing unions to consider complementary strategies {{in order to make}} their voices heard in politics. This article reviews European trade unions' use of different direct democratic channels to influence policy-making at local, national and EU levels. We distinguish direct democratic consultations initiated by the government from above (mandatory referenda and plebiscites) from direct democratic initiatives initiated by citizens from below (initiatives and facultative referenda) and discuss corresponding trade union experiences at local and national levels, namely in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Slovenia, and Switzerland. Furthermore, we are also analysing the successful right 2 water <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ECI) of the European Federation of Public Service Unions and the failed fair transport ECI of the European Transport Workers' Federation at EU level. Whereas unions successfully used direct democratic instruments to (1) defend social achievements or (2) as a lever to extract concessions from policy-makers, direct democracy is also challenging. Successful direct democratic campaigns require unions that are able to mobilise their own rank-and-file and to inspire larger sections of society...|$|E
40|$|Participation is an {{important}} theme in current democratic theory and there is burgeoning use of its institutional form, direct democracy, to legitimise political bodies and their decision-making. This thesis analyses the legislative design and implementation of two recent direct democracy innovations: the <b>European</b> <b>Citizens</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ECI) and the referenda in the European Union Act (EUA). The agenda setting ECI, which gives EU citizens the chance to propose legal acts of the Union, is the first supranational instrument of direct democracy, and the EUA contains the UK’s first ongoing legislative criteria that trigger a referendum. The duality of EU democracy is an essential aspect of its legitimisation. Two dichotomies are therefore used to frame the analysis of direct democracy in the EU: the supranational (direct) and intergovernmental (indirect) routes of EU legitimisation and the legitimisation of the EU’s constitutional framework and its daily authority. These dichotomies, and democratic criteria focussed on citizen participation and influence over the political agenda, support {{the analysis of the}} likely combined impact of the ECI and EUA on the dual EU democracy. The critical assessment of the legislative design of the ECI and of the Commission’s decision-making in relation to the ECI shows that institutional mediation and the EU’s duality {{have a significant impact on}} the potential to increase the influence of EU citizens on the EU political agenda, and to facilitate a challenge to established policy preferences. Similarly the critical analysis of the EUA referenda provisions indicate that the apparently strong opportunity to vote on the UK’s EU policy in a referendum is qualified in a number of respects by institutional control reflected in the legislation itself, and that the chance of citizen-led policy preferences is diminished. The thesis concludes with a combined analysis of the ECI and EUA to assess the joint impact of direct democracy on dual EU democracy through answering two questions: ‘What are their implications for the EU democratic paradigm?’, and ‘What is their influence together on EU democratic legitimacy?’. The overall findings are that the impact of the ECI and EUA, despite posing some challenges and despite their democratic potential, is likely to be heavily restricted as a result of institutional control and the EU’s political framework...|$|E
