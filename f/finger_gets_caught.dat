50|$|Jerry {{arises from}} {{under one of}} the keys. Tom plays tremolo on this key, {{knocking}} Jerry on the head, and then Jerry runs back and forth underneath. Tom smashes the mouse under the keys, plays the main theme of the rhapsody, and when Tom lifts his two fingers from playing a trill, the piano continues playing. He looks {{over the edge of the}} piano and spots Jerry playing the felts from inside. To quiet him, he whacks Jerry with a tuning tool. Jerry slams the piano lid onto Tom's fingers. Tom still plays, and then Jerry pops out on the far right of the piano to attempt to cut Tom's finger with a pair of scissors as he plays a note from the very highest minor third of the piano. After the sixth miss, Jerry pants from this effort, and then substitutes a mousetrap for the white keys just below it. Tom plays the keys on either side for a few seconds but eventually, Tom's <b>finger</b> <b>gets</b> <b>caught</b> in the trap.|$|E
5000|$|CEC pioneered {{efforts to}} {{establish}} correct slide angles, tethering attachments, wall and upper deck heights, which were submitted {{to both the}} ASTM and the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission (USCPCS). They also assist {{in the writing of}} safeguards for inflatable amusement devices that have been adopted by safety inspectors from the ASTM and the USCPSC. CEC's website states that all of its products comply with safety regulation in all 50 states of the US. Numerous additional and redundant safety features are also incorporated (i.e. sun shades, fine mesh walls in which children's <b>fingers</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>caught),</b> for which CEC was named Most Safety Conscious Manufacturer ...|$|R

5000|$|Advantages of this {{conveyor}} {{are quiet}} operation, easy installation, moderate maintenance and low expense. Line-shaft conveyors are also extremely safe {{for people to}} work around because the elastic belts can stretch and not injure <b>fingers</b> should any <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> underneath them. Moreover, the spools will slip and allow the rollers to stop moving if clothing, hands or hair <b>gets</b> <b>caught</b> in them. In addition, since the spools are slightly loose on the shaft, they act like clutches that slip when products are required to accumulate (stop moving and bump up against each other. i.e. queue up). With the exception of soft bottomed containers like cement bags, these conveyors can be utilized for almost all applications.|$|R

Our design allows exogenous variation in the rewards of crime, and the penalty and probability of detection. We find that the probability of stealing is increasing in {{the amount of money that}} can be stolen, and that it is decreasing in the probability of <b>getting</b> <b>caught</b> and in the penalty for <b>getting</b> <b>caught.</b> Furthermore, the impact of the certainty of <b>getting</b> <b>caught</b> is larger when the penalty is bigger, and the impact of the penalty is bigger when the probability of <b>getting</b> <b>caught</b> is larger. ...|$|R
