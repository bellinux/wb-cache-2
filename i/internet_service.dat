40|$|An {{ultimate}} goal for modern <b>Internet</b> <b>services</b> {{is the development}} of scalable, high-performance, highly-available and fault-tolerant systems. Replication is an important approach to achieve this goal. However, replication introduces the issue of consistency among replicas, which is further complicated by network partitions. Generally, higher consistency levels result in lower system availability in the presence of network partitions. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between consistency and availability in building replicated <b>Internet</b> <b>services.</b> In this paper, we argue that <b>Internet</b> <b>services</b> can benefit from dynamically choosing availability/consistency tradeoffs. With three consistency metrics, Unseen Writes, Uncommitted Writes and Staleness, we show how consistency can be meaningfully quantified for many <b>Internet</b> <b>services.</b> We present the design of the TACT (Tunable Availability and Consistency Tradeoffs) toolkit that allows <b>Internet</b> <b>services</b> to flexibly and dynamically choose thei [...] ...|$|R
