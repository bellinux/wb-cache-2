25|$|From the {{earliest}} records {{regarding the use}} of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materiae medicae. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. Traditional Chinese herbal remedies are conveniently available from grocery stores in most Chinese neighborhoods; some of these items may contain toxic ingredients, are imported into the U.S. illegally, and are associated with claims of therapeutic benefit without evidence. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it couldn't (i.e., in Curculigo). Traditional herbal medicines can contain extremely toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and naturally occurring toxins, which can cause illness, exacerbate pre-existing poor health or result in death. Botanical misidentification of plants can cause toxic reactions in humans. The description on some plants used in traditional Chinese medicine have changed, leading to unintended intoxication of the wrong plants. A concern is also contaminated herbal medicines with microorganisms and fungal toxins, including aflatoxin. Traditional herbal medicines are sometimes contaminated with toxic heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium, which inflict serious health risks to consumers. Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and <b>glibenclamide,</b> has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|There is an {{upregulation}} of this SUR1/ TRPM4 nonselective cation channel {{followed by}} brain tumor, ischemic injury, and traumatic brain injury. This channel which is activated by ATP depletion is found on neurons, neuroglia and endothelium. This channel enables the passive {{transport of water}} and solute and represents the [...] ATP independent stage of cerebral formation. Opening of these channels result in cellular depolarization and blebbing causing cytotoxic edema. This can be prevented by using glyburide (<b>glibenclamide)</b> which inhibits these channels.|$|E
50|$|Glicaramide (SQ-65993) is an orally {{bioavailable}} anti-diabetic medication. It has {{a similar}} potency as <b>glibenclamide</b> (glyburide) {{in the class of}} medication known as sulfonylureas. Its structure is similar since it has a cyclic acyl group which replaces the latter's 2-methoxy-5-chlorobenzyl. Same as <b>glibenclamide,</b> it is classified as a second-generation sulfonylurea. It may have more pronounced extra-pancreatic effects than <b>glibenclamide</b> or tolbutamide.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{secondary}} sufonylureas {{have the}} same risks of hypoglycemia. <b>Glibenclamide</b> (glyburide) is associated with an incidence of hypoglycemia of up to 20-30%, compared to as low as 2% to 4% with glimepiride. <b>Glibenclamide</b> also interferes with the normal homeostatic suppression of insulin secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not. Also, <b>glibenclamide</b> diminishes glucagon secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not.|$|E

50|$|HMR 1883 (1-5-2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl-2-methoxyphenylsulfonyl-3 methylthiourea) and its {{sodium salt}} HMR 1098, are {{experimental}} anti-arrhythmic drugs classified as sulfonylthiourea compounds. Their main {{purpose is to}} treat ventricular fibrillation caused by myocardial ischemia. They were synthesized via structural modifications to <b>glibenclamide,</b> an antidiabetic drug. Both HMR 1883 and <b>glibenclamide</b> act by inactivating the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) responsible for potassium efflux. Unlike <b>glibenclamide,</b> HMR 1883 has been suggested to target selectively the Kir6.2/SUR2A KATP subtype, found mostly in the membranes of cardiac cells. However, data showing that HMR 1098 inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 KATP subtype found in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells challenges this view.|$|E

50|$|An orally {{administered}} {{hot water}} extract of P. pulmonarius {{had a significant}} antihyperglycemic effect, halted the progression of diabetes, and reduced the mortality of alloxan induced diabetic mice by approximately 50%. It showed a synergistic effect with the antidiabetic drug <b>glibenclamide,</b> supporting the possibility of effective combination therapy of <b>glibenclamide</b> and P. pulmonarius for diabetes.|$|E
50|$|After a {{cerebral}} ischemic insult, the {{blood-brain barrier}} is broken and <b>glibenclamide</b> {{can reach the}} central nervous system. <b>Glibenclamide</b> {{has been shown to}} bind more efficiently to the ischemic hemisphere.

50|$|<b>Glibenclamide</b> (AAN, BAN, INN), {{also known}} as glyburide (USAN), is an {{antidiabetic}} drug {{in a class of}} medications known as sulfonylureas, closely related to sulfonamide antibiotics.

50|$|Glybuzole is a {{hypoglycaemic}} medicine, mainly used {{to treat}} diabetes mellitus type 2. It is an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD), when administered in the right dose it will help bring the blood glycose level down by stimulating the insulin production.

50|$|<b>Glibenclamide</b> is {{available}} as a generic, is manufactured by many pharmaceutical companies and is sold in doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg under many brand names including Gliben-J, Daonil, Diabeta, Euglucon, Gilemal, Glidanil, Glybovin, Glynase, Maninil, Micronase and Semi-Daonil. It is also available in a fixed-dose combination drug with metformin that is sold under various trade names, e.g. Bagomet Plus, Benimet, Glibomet, Gluconorm, Glucored, Glucovance, Metglib and many others.|$|E

50|$|HMR 1883 attenuates ischemically induced arrhythmias {{with little}} to no side effects {{as a result of}} having a higher {{affinity}} for the cardiac tissue KATP subtype then any other subtype found in the body. In contrast, <b>glibenclamide</b> interacts with many KATP channels throughout the body resulting in many side effects. In particular its interaction with coronary smooth muscle cells and pancreatic-β cells cause decreased coronary blood flow, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia.Since KATP channels only become activated during periods of low ATP and High ADP, HMR 1883 only affects hypoxic tissue and has no negative effect on the normal tissue.Activation of the KATP channels on cardiac mitochondria is involved in ischemic preconditioning that results in protection for the heart. It was shown that HMR 1883 did not interfere with the mitochondrial protective mechanisms in both rat and rabbit models. By not inhibiting the mitochondrial KATP channel subtype, HMR 1883 can treat cardiac arrhythmias while permitting mitochondrial protective mechanisms.|$|E
