5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Carnot <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> up in the port of Brest, along with Charles Martel. Both ships were retained on the effective list, however, pending {{the completion of the}} new s. Carnot was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrapping that year.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 2009, {{fewer than}} 200 {{contractors}} {{walked out of}} or {{failed to show up}} in a wildcat strike, showing solidarity with workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire where 51 workers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> off while another employer on the site was employing. A spokeswoman said the strike did not affect electricity output.|$|E
5|$|At 05:10, four German torpedo boats {{reached the}} Eastern Task Force and {{launched}} fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword beach but missing the battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies. After attacking, the German vessels {{turned away and}} fled east into a smoke screen that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included USS Corry off Utah and USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft. In addition, many landing craft were lost.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> out after World War II was extended.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2008, Hentoff was {{a weekly}} {{contributing}} columnist at WorldNetDaily.com. In January 2009, the Village Voice, which had regularly published Hentoff's commentary and criticism for fifty years, {{announced that he}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> off. He {{then went on to}} write for publications such as United Features, Jewish World Review, and The Wall Street Journal. Hentoff joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, as a senior fellow in February 2009.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} January 2008. To pass over Strømmen, a fourth Nygård Bridge {{was built for}} cars, and the oldest was {{upgraded}} and used by the light rail line. In several places the road needed to be dug up to remove pipes and cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled that the power company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a tour {{match against}} the Englishmen, Woodfull made 275 not out for Victoria, his highest score for his state. During the match, Woodfull was captain and had agreed with English captain Chapman to vary rules that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> by the Australian Board of Control. The two men agreed {{to cover the}} pitch {{throughout}} the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight. The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the Victorian Cricket Association. The match was a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales was {{originally}} named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII {{the ship was}} renamed even before she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> down. This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.|$|E
5|$|West Apaum sailed {{on three}} voyages for the US Navy, two after the Armistice, {{before she was}} {{decommissioned}} in July 1919. Though little is available regarding West Apaums civilian career, {{it is known that}} she was sailing on a New York – Rotterdam route in early 1927. By early 1929, West Apaum <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> up by the USSB, which abandoned her in 1933. The cargo ship was scrapped {{in the second quarter of}} that same year.|$|E

5|$|Air strikes {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day, and Southern Command received optimistic reports {{during the afternoon}} from the IAF, which claimed seven bridges knocked out of action, with the remaining ones to be destroyed by evening. In fact, several of the bridges that had been destroyed were decoys. The real bridges meanwhile, had their damaged sections quickly repaired and returned to service. Ten heavy bridges <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> during the crossing (two bridges in the south were laid but not operational). Now, on October 7, five of these bridges were removed and placed with the two already in reserve, leaving each division with one heavy bridge and one light bridge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} March {{or early}} in April 1916, the British {{presence}} in the Sinai was growing; 16 miles (26km) of track, including sidings, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid.</b> Between 21 March and 11 April, the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915, they had {{been used by the}} central group of about 6,000 or 7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across the Sinai Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route could no longer be used by large forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of imports and exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.|$|E
5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E

5|$|Early in her {{civilian}} career, she sailed between New York City and Bordeaux, {{but later}} shifted to sailing to Antwerp. For {{most of the}} 1920s, West Corum sailed to Argentine ports. By 1939, West Corum <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> up in New Orleans. In 1940, she was reconditioned, transferred to the United States Army, and renamed USAT Will H. Point. During World War II, the ship sailed primarily in the Pacific Ocean, calling at ports in Australia, Alaska, and the U.S. West Coast. Will H. Point was laid up in the reserve fleet in Astoria, Oregon, in January 1947 and sold for scrapping in July of that same year.|$|E
5|$|Most {{newspaper}} mentions of West Corum do {{not report}} {{what sorts of}} cargo she carried, but a January 1922 Associated Press story in The Christian Science Monitor reveals her cargo for one voyage from Argentina. In what the news item said was the first full load of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to be enough for 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with consignments of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid</b> up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds {{took off}} from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship, Iran Ajr. The Nightstalkers {{observed}} Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As Iran Ajrs crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, {{as well as a}} logbook revealing areas where previous mines <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>laid.</b> The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.|$|E
