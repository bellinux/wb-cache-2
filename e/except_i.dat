Graham, on the film [...] On {{his role in the}} episode, Lauter has stated [...] "I don’t really have {{a lot to say about}} that, <b>except</b> <b>I</b> thought I did a nice job, and that it was nice working up there in Vancouver with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson".|$|E
500|$|By this time, Stevens {{was in his}} {{seventies and}} in poor health; he was carried {{everywhere}} in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the Clerk of the House that when the roll was called, {{the names of the}} southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio's Rutherford B. Hayes, described Stevens, [...] "He is radical throughout, <b>except,</b> <b>I</b> am told, he don't believe in hanging. [...] He is leader." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party were murdered in the deadliest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent with two stockmen to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. He returned several days later to a scene of devastation. Despairing and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: [...] "... all our party <b>except</b> <b>I</b> have been slaughtered by the black's ... I am in a great fix no men." [...] Police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 70 local Aborigines; the total may have been 300. Wills took refuge near Cullin-la-ringo, and though he desired to avenge his father's death, {{there is no evidence}} that he joined the reprisal raids.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. <b>Except</b> <b>I</b> did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, <b>except</b> <b>I</b> left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron {{speaks in}} a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, {{although}} he is often shown to be very giddy {{when it comes to}} riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as [...] "like yoga, <b>except</b> <b>I</b> still get to kill something." [...] He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as [...] "strong, self-possessed women {{at the top of their}} fields," [...] with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as [...] "The Swanson." [...] He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over. He primarily drinks scotch whisky, claiming that [...] "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." [...] He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as [...] "springtime" [...] on a hospital admission form). Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the [...] "toothy gal from Mystic Pizza," [...] and he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter. He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to [...] "Hello Walls" [...] and [...] "Buddy" [...] during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|The {{events of}} Jesus' last week occupy {{a third of}} the content of all four gospels. Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph and drives the money changers from the temple, holds a last supper, prays to be spared the coming agony (but concludes [...] "if this cup may not pass away from me, <b>except</b> <b>I</b> drink it, thy will be done"), and is betrayed. He is tried by the Jewish leaders (the Sanhedrin) and before Pontius Pilate, and Pilate washes his hands to {{indicate}} that he does not assume responsibility. Jesus is crucified as king of the Jews, mocked by all. On his death there is an earthquake, the veil of the Temple is rent, and saints rise from their tombs. Mary Magdalene and another Mary discover the empty tomb, guarded by an angel, and Jesus himself tells them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.|$|E
