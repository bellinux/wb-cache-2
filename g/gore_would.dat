During the Vietnam War, the brigade numbered over 13,000 officers and enlisted men organized into three engineer groups, with 14 battalions and 31 separate companies and detachments. One of these soldiers, Al <b>Gore,</b> <b>would</b> later become Vice President of the United States.|$|E

Gore, the Florida Legislature had been meeting in Special Session since December 8th {{with the sole}} stated purpose being {{the selection of a}} slate of electors on December 12th, should the dispute still be ongoing. Had the recount gone forward, it would have awarded those electors to Bush, based on the state-certified vote, and the likely last recourse for <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have been to contest the electors in the United States Congress. The electors would then only have been rejected if both GOP-controlled houses had agreed to reject them.|$|E
25|$|Edwards {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{formally}} announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. Through most of 2007, even after it was evident that Al <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> not run, he and Edwards each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama.|$|E
500|$|However, Gore had {{to compete}} with Hillary, the First Lady, for President Clinton's influence, {{starting}} when she was appointed health-care task force without Gore being consulted. Vanity Fair wrote that President Clinton's [...] "failure to confide in his vice president was a telling sign of the real pecking order", and reported [...] "it was an open secret that some of Hillary's advisers...nurtured dreams that Hillary, not <b>Gore,</b> <b>would</b> follow Bill in the presidency".|$|E

They were a good team: Johnson <b>would</b> design and <b>Gores</b> <b>would</b> draft the ideas to a {{polished}} result. Gores helped Johnson on Early Miesian inspired houses which included the Booth House, the Rockefeller townhouse, the MOMA garden, and the famous Glass House. Upon complaints that Johnson had not yet passed his New York architectural exam and therefore could not practice in New York state, the two left their office in NYC and relocated their practice to New Canaan, Connecticut. In 1951 Johnson and Gores parted professionally, and on November 1 Gores opened his own architectural practice, a date that corresponded {{with the birth of}} his fourth child.|$|R
5000|$|Gore was glamorous and {{has been}} {{described}} as a flighty mother with an apparent lack of maternal interest in her children.

500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral {{toward all}} of the candidates which led to speculation that he {{would come out of}} a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because {{he did not want to}} repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election that <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode pokes fun at {{the dwindling}} {{popularity}} of Bill Clinton's presidency at the time. In their list 15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras, Genevieve Koski, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Sean O'Neal, Kyle Ryan, and Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote [...] "By the time this episode aired , the nation had endured {{more than a year}} of the Lewinsky scandal. The episode debuted a month after the House impeached Clinton, but less than two weeks before the Senate's impeach/acquit vote, so an air of uncertainty lingered over an otherwise lightweight episode about Homer organizing a Super Bowl trip." [...] In a scene in the episode, Clinton calls to congratulate the Super Bowl victors from the Oval Office, but is distracted by Al Gore measuring a window. As Scully recalls, at the time, the Simpsons writers were confident <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> win the 2000 presidential election, which eventually was marginally, and controversially, won by George W. Bush.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{claim is}} that Nader's {{candidacy}} {{acted as a}} spoiler in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, in which 537 votes gave George W. Bush a crucial and controversial victory in Florida (Nader received almost [...] votes in Florida, from which a slight decrease in favor of <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have altered the outcome). Others, including Nader, dispute this claim.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the literary giallo tradition, early gialli were also influenced by the German [...] "krimi" [...] films of the early 1960s. Produced by Danish/German studio Rialto Film, these black-and-white crime movies based on Edgar Wallace stories typically featured whodunit mystery plots with a masked killer, anticipating several key components of the giallo movement by several years. Despite their link to giallo author Wallace, though, they featured little of the excessive stylization and <b>gore</b> which <b>would</b> define Italian gialli.|$|R
2500|$|In the closely contested 2000 election, {{the state}} played a pivotal role. Out {{of more than}} 5.8 million votes for the two main contenders Bush and Al Gore, around 500 votes {{separated}} the two candidates for the all-decisive Florida electoral votes that landed Bush the election win. Florida's felony disenfranchisement law is more severe than most European nations or other American states. A 2002 study in the American Sociological Review concluded that [...] "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted {{at the same rate}} as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the election, recounts {{conducted}} by various news media organizations continued a primary focus on ballots that machines read as not showing a vote. Based on {{the review of}} these ballots, their results indicated that Bush would have won if certain recounting methods had been used (including the one favored by Gore {{at the time of}} the Supreme Court decision), but that Gore might have won under other standards and scenarios. In contrast, according to Lance deHaven-Smith of Florida State University, based on [...] "the definitive study of the uncounted ballots" [...] (the Florida Ballot Project by NORC at the University of Chicago), if all the legally valid votes in Florida had been counted statewide, <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have been the winner, a conclusion deHaven-Smith calls [...] "unambiguous and unavoidable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Parker and Stone began {{plotting}} {{a television}} sitcom starring {{the winner of}} the 2000 Presidential election. The duo were [...] "95 percent sure" [...] that Democratic candidate Al <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> win, and tentatively titled the show Everybody Loves Al. The main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of who the President would be, the show's production was pushed back. The show was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot.|$|E

2500|$|Further, {{according}} to sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election {{might have gone}} to Al Gore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law disenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain suffrage. In their 2002 American Sociological Review article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election. Matt Ford noted their study concluded [...] "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted {{at the same rate}} as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have won Florida—and the presidency—by more than 80,000 votes."

2500|$|Ultimately, a media consortium—comprising The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Tribune Co. (parent of the Los Angeles Times), Associated Press, CNN, The Palm Beach Post and the St. Petersburg Times—hired NORC at the University of Chicago {{to examine}} 175,010 ballots that were {{collected}} from the entire state, not just the disputed counties that were recounted; these ballots contained undervotes (ballots with no machine-detected choice made for president) and overvotes (ballots {{with more than one}} choice marked). Their goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used for the voting process. Based on the NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over all the ballots in question had been resolved by applying statewide any of five standards that would have met Florida's legal standard for recounts, the electoral result would have been reversed and <b>Gore</b> <b>would</b> have won by 60 to 171 votes.

6000|$|Anxiety the First: Where is the Body? or, The Mystery of Bent Pitman. It was now manifestly {{plain that}} Bent Pitman (as {{was to be}} looked for from his ominous appellation) belonged to the darker order of the {{criminal}} class. An honest man would not have cashed the bill; a humane man would not have accepted in silence the tragic contents of the water-butt; a man, who was not already up to the hilts in <b>gore,</b> <b>would</b> have lacked the means of secretly disposing them. This process of reasoning left a horrid image of the monster, Pitman. Doubtless he had long ago disposed of the body--dropping it through a trap-door in his back kitchen, Morris supposed, with some hazy recollection of a picture in a penny dreadful; and doubtless the man now lived in wanton splendour on the proceeds of the bill. So far, all was peace. But with the profligate habits of a man like Bent Pitman (who was no doubt a hunchback in the bargain), eight hundred pounds could be easily melted in a week.

6000|$|The {{horror of}} the {{bystanders}} began now {{to give way to}} indignation, and the sight of a favourite companion murdered in the midst of them, the provocation being, in their opinion, so utterly inadequate to the excess of vengeance, might have induced them to kill the perpetrator of the deed even upon the very spot. The constable, however, did his duty on this occasion, and with the assistance of some of the more reasonable persons present, procured horses to guard the prisoner to Carlisle, to abide his doom at the next assizes. While the escort was preparing, the prisoner neither expressed the least interest, nor attempted the slightest reply. Only, before he was carried from the fatal apartment, he desired to look at the dead body, which, raised from the floor, had been deposited upon the large table (at the head of which Harry Wakefield had presided but a few minutes before, full of life, vigour, and animation), until the surgeons should examine the mortal wound. The face of the corpse was decently covered with a napkin. To the surprise and {{horror of the}} bystanders, which displayed itself in a general AH! drawn through clenched teeth and half-shut lips, Robin Oig removed the cloth, and gazed with a mournful but steady eye on the lifeless visage, which had been so lately animated that the smile of good-humoured confidence in his own strength, of conciliation at once and contempt towards his enemy, still curled his lip. While those present expected that the wound, which had so lately flooded the apartment with <b>gore,</b> <b>would</b> send forth fresh streams at the touch of the homicide, Robin Oig replaced the covering with the brief exclamation, [...] "He was a pretty man!" ...|$|E
