5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> {{that in all}} my {{conversations with}} you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I {{have never seen a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E

500|$|A. Yes, that as well, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that, too. The {{transports}} to the camps, the transports {{from the}} camps {{to the work}} sites, the transfers from camp to camp following {{the interests of the}} Economic-Administrative Head Office, the work inside the concentration camp - all of these concepts are covered by [...] "special treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> {{that during}} the war I never disobeyed an order, but when General Seidemann ordered Graf and me to fly to the British sector and {{surrender}} to avoid the Soviets, {{with the rest of}} the wing to surrender to the Soviets, I could not leave my men. [...] That would have been bad leadership.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 he met James Baldwin at {{a conference}} held by the African Literature Association in Gainesville, Florida, USA. The writers– with similar {{political}} perspectives, beliefs about language, and faith in the liberating potential of literature– were eager to meet one another. Baldwin said: [...] "It's {{very important that we}} should meet each other, finally, if <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> so, after something like 400 years." ...|$|E

"I {{have decided}} to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because I have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because {{there are things that}} <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> to you. I have spent many days and nights behind bars {{thinking}} about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to what I have to say." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1905–06, George, Prince of Wales, visited India {{and wrote}} to the King from Agra, [...] "In the evening we saw the Munshi. [...] He has not grown more {{beautiful}} and is getting fat. [...] <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> he was most civil and humble and really pleased to see us. [...] He wore his C.V.O. which I {{had no idea he}} had got. [...] I am told he lives quietly here and gives no trouble at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Indeed, {{it may not}} be {{inappropriate}} to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement. [...] Distinguished University of Chicago Divinity School theologian Shailer Mathews once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book Religion in the Making: [...] "It is infuriating, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Turkish {{commander}} sighed. [...] "When we meet again," [...] he said, [...] "may we {{meet with}} brighter hopes and more buoyant spirits. At present, <b>I</b> <b>must,</b> indeed, <b>say</b> farewell." ...|$|R

500|$|UTV Home Entertainment {{released}} the film on DVD in India on 25 July 2008. It was launched at Darsheel Safary's school, Green Lawns High School, in Mumbai. Aamir Khan, Tisca Chopra, Vipin Sharma, Sachet Engineer, {{and the rest}} of the cast and crew were present. In his speech, Khan stated, [...] "Darsheel is a very happy child, full of life and vibrant. I am sure it's because of the way his parents and teachers have treated him. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> Darsheel's principal Mrs. Bajaj has been extremely supportive and encouraging. The true test of any school is how happy the kids are and by the looks of it, the children here seem really happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, and all I can see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting {{in the middle of the}} table and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E

500|$|... "To {{those people}} who complained that a {{photograph}} appeared in the press showing Connie and Sam kissing when they did not actually kiss in the transmitted episode, I am afraid <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> a genuine mistake occurred for which I apologise. The only script that ever featured Connie and Sam actually kissing was in the final scene of Episode 44 (transmitted on 29 August). This was edited together as scripted and shot. Nothing was cut [...] I am sorry if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie. A photograph from this shoot was mistakenly released and marked as being from Episode 45 as Connie was wearing the same outfit in both episodes. I can only apologise for this mistake. [...] I am sorry a few people had concerns over these episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E
