5|$|<b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> {{two years}} and eight months old when her mother was {{beheaded}} on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> declared illegitimate and deprived of {{her place in the}} royal succession. Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the birth of their son, Prince Edward, in 1537. From his birth, Edward was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> placed in his household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1339, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> the {{daughter}} of Ban StephenII of Bosnia, {{the head of the}} House of Kotromanić. Her mother, Elizabeth of Kuyavia, {{was a member of the}} House of Piast and grandniece of King Władysław I of Poland. The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth's mother. After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman, having in mind a future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> sent to the dowager's court.|$|E

5|$|Charles's arrival was well-prepared. He was {{accompanied}} by his Hungarian supporters and <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> unable to raise an army against him or prevent him from convoking a diet, in which he obtained an overwhelming support.

5|$|<b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> born at Greenwich Palace and {{was named}} after both her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard. She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> the heir {{presumptive}} to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, Mary, had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, {{with the intent to}} sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September; Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, the Marquess of Exeter, the Duchess of Norfolk and the Dowager Marchioness of Dorset stood as her godparents.|$|E

5|$|Further {{advancement}} of rank was facilitated with Conroy's marriage to Elizabeth Fisher on 26 December 1808 in Dublin, {{though not as}} far as Conroy felt he deserved. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of Colonel (later Major-General) Benjamin Fisher and Conroy served under him in Ireland and England while performing various administrative duties. Conroy was promoted to Second Captain on 13 March 1811 and appointed adjutant in the Corps of Artillery Drivers on 11 March 1817.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1554, Wyatt's {{rebellion}} broke out; it {{was soon}} suppressed. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though {{it is unlikely that}} she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador Simon Renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including Lord Paget, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> moved from the Tower to Woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield. Crowds cheered her all along the way.|$|E
5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, {{in the eyes}} of many Catholics, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus was {{the elder}} son of Stephen V, son of Béla IV of Hungary, and Stephen's wife Elizabeth the Cuman. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> the {{daughter}} of a chieftain of the Cumans who had settled in Hungary.

5|$|Large {{projects}} were commenced. The city of <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> {{built by the}} Housing Trust in Adelaide's north, {{for the production of}} GM Holden motor vehicles.

5|$|Mary's fiancé Sigismund and {{his brother}} Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia, were also opposed to Elizabeth and Garai. The queen dowager and the Palatine, on the other hand, were not {{enthusiastic}} about Sigismund reigning together with Mary. Both Sigismund and Charles schemed to invade Hungary; the former intended to marry Mary and become her co-ruler, while the latter intended to depose her. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> determined to allow neither and, in 1384, started negotiating Mary's marriage to Louis of France, notwithstanding her daughter's engagement to Sigismund. Had this proposal been made after Catherine's death in 1378, the Western Schism would have represented a problem, with France recognising ClementVII as pope and Hungary accepting UrbanVI. However, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> desperate to avoid an invasion in 1384 and unwilling to let the schism {{stand in the way}} of the negotiations with the French. ClementVII issued a dispensation which annulled Mary's betrothal to Sigismund, and her proxy marriage to Louis was celebrated in April 1385, but it was not recognized by the Hungarian noblemen, who adhered to Urban VI.|$|E

5|$|Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie {{canceled}} the yearly preseason matchup in Tampa, {{claiming that the}} Buccaneers approached the matchup with excessive intensity, resulting in Dolphin injuries.

5|$|On 17 April 1555, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>was</b> {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
