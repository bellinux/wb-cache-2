5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> with France.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise,</b> albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E

5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio {{from his}} native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> {{in the debate over}} whether all of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, {{following}} the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian {{defeat in the}} Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal {{with all of the}} nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian élites.|$|E
25|$|Setting up an army {{after the}} war proved more {{difficult}} than predicted. To a certain extent, the authorities could rely on escaped German conscripts and Luxembourgers who had joined Allied armies; however, they {{had to find a}} way to train officers. Initially, British military advisers came to Luxembourg, where training was carried out by British officers and NCOs. But officer training, in the long term, would have to be done in military schools abroad. Belgium and France were both interested in helping and offered solutions. In the end, the government opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> solution, by sending some officer cadets to the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France and others to the Royal Military Academy in Belgium. This eventually led to disunity within the Luxembourg officer corps due to differences in training and promotion.|$|E

Feeling ran high and many fiery speeches were made, but it soon became evident that a majority of the members did not think that the situation at that time called for secession.

The opinion seemed to prevail that Arkansas should secede only if the Federal government made war on the Confederate States.

The King instead pressed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise,</b> summoning various political leaders to Balmoral Castle individually for talks.

She also supported the Earl of Antrim's proposals to settle the rebellion in Ireland and bring forces across the sea to support the King in England. Henrietta Maria continued to vigorously argue for nothing less than a total victory over Charles' enemies, countering proposals <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise.</b> She rejected private messages from Pym and Hampden asking her to use her influence over the King to create a peace treaty, and was impeached by Parliament shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, Parliament had voted to destroy her private chapel at Somerset House and arrest the Capuchin friars who maintained it. In March, Henry Marten and John Clotworthy forced their way into the chapel with troops and destroyed the altarpiece by Rubens, smashed many of the statues and made a bonfire of the Queen's religious canvases, books and vestments.|$|E

Surprised, Farnese understood that with such strong opposition he would never obtain the required majority, but, admitting his defeat, he wished {{to be able to use}} his influence effectively in the choice of the new pontiff. Almost the whole next day leaders of the main factions: Farnese, Bonelli, Granvelle and Borromeo, spent looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> candidate, and finally agreed to elect the 70-year-old Ugo Boncompagni. The first scrutiny took place on May 13 at six o’clock in the evening. At the end of the phase of accessus Ugo Boncompagni was elected Pope, receiving all votes except of his own, which he gave to Granvelle. He accepted his election and took the name of Gregory XIII, in honour of Pope Gregory I.|$|E
