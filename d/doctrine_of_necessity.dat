5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nusrat Bhutto, {{the wife}} of the deposed Prime Minister, filed a suit against Zia's {{military}} regime, challenging the validity of the July 1977 military coup. The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled, in what would later be known as the <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} 1954 <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity)</b> that, given the dangerously unstable political situation of the time, Zia's overthrowing of the Bhutto government was legal on the grounds of necessity.

25|$|The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> is an {{exception}} to the rule against bias and operates to prevent a failure of justice. According to Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang (1982), necessity is the greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator who appears to be biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself from participating in a proceeding. This rule is firmly established and is to the effect that disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, pecuniary interest, personal hostility or bias.|$|E

In the 1850s, Lincoln believed in [...] "providence" [...] in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered {{the death of his}} son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God [...] "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." [...] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.|$|E

But what determines your likings and dislikings? Did you make your own constitution? Is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful? And even if it were, why did you prefer to make it after the one fashion rather than the other? The passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom, which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> is mere futility, for nobody denies it. What they really have to do, if they would upset the necessarian argument, is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever; to like pain as much as pleasure; vice as much as virtue; in short, to prove, that, whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things, that of thought is given over to chance.|$|E

6000|$|... § 1. The question, {{whether the}} law of {{causality}} applies in the same strict sense to human actions as to other phenomena, is the celebrated controversy concerning {{the freedom of the}} will; which, from at least {{as far back as the}} time of Pelagius, has divided both the philosophical and the religious world. The affirmative opinion is commonly called the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity,</b> as asserting human volitions and actions to be necessary and inevitable. The negative maintains that the will is not determined, like other phenomena, by antecedents, but determines itself; that our volitions are not, properly speaking, the effects of causes, or at least have no causes which they uniformly and implicitly obey.|$|E
60|$|Kant's mode {{of dealing}} with the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> is very singular. That the {{phenomena}} of the mind follow fixed relations of cause and effect is, to him, as unquestionable as it is to Hume. But then there is the Ding an sich, the Noumenon, or Kantian equivalent for the substance of the soul. This, being out of the phenomenal world, is subject to none of the laws of phenomena, and is consequently as absolutely free, and as completely powerless, as a mathematical point, in vacua, would be. Hence volition is uncaused, so far as it belongs to the noumenon; but, necessary, so far as it takes effect in the phenomenal world.|$|E
60|$|But the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> {{teaches us}} that in no case could any event have {{happened}} otherwise than it did happen, and that, if God {{is the author of}} good, He {{is also the author of}} evil; that, if He is entitled to our gratitude for the one, He is entitled to our hatred for the other; that, admitting the existence of this hypothetic being, He is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity. It is plain that the same arguments which prove that God is the author of food, light, and life, prove Him also to be the author of poison, darkness, and death. The wide-wasting earthquake, the storm, the battle, and the tyranny, are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature, sunshine, liberty, and peace.|$|E

50|$|Dawson's {{interests}} also embraced metaphysics and theology, {{subjects that}} he explored in correspondence with a favourite early pupil, the Rev.

Described by Adam Sedgwick as ‘a firm believer and a good sober practical Christian of the old school’, Dawson abhorred the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> David Hume and applauded James Beattie's attack on Humean scepticism. In a similar spirit he wrote against Joseph Priestley's The <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Philosophical <b>Necessity</b> (1777), which he regarded as immoral in tendency and false. His 24-page pamphlet outlining his views on the damaging consequences and unsure foundations of an acceptance <b>of</b> determinism, The <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Philosophical <b>Necessity</b> Briefly Invalidated (1781), elicited a dismissive, unsigned rejoinder in the Monthly Review (65, 1781, pp. 66-8), which he answered in an appendix to a second edition {{of the work in}} 1803. Although Dawson is said to have retained the respect of Priestley and his other adversaries, his contribution lacked the sophistication that the debate demanded at the highest level and it made little lasting mark.|$|R

60|$|He who asserts the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> means that, {{contemplating the}} events which compose {{the moral and}} {{material}} universe, he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects, no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy, or act in any other place than it does act. The idea of necessity is obtained by our experience {{of the connection between}} objects, the uniformity of the operations of nature, the constant conjunction of similar events, and the consequent inference of one from the other. Mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity, if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action. Motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe. The word liberty, as applied to mind, is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter: they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents.|$|E
60|$|The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> {{tends to}} {{introduce}} a great change into the established notions of morality, and utterly to destroy religion. Reward and punishment must be considered, by the Necessarian, merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct. Desert, in the present sense of the word, {{would no longer have}} any meaning; and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it, would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice? It is not enough, says the advocate of free-will, that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime: he should feel pain, and his torments, when justly inflicted, ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault. But utility is morality; that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless; and though the crime of Damiens must be condemned, yet the frightful torments which revenge, under the name of justice, inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented, even at the long run, the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world. At the same time, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice. The conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal, and that a tiger is constrained, by the inevitable condition of his existence, to devour men, does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously, or, even more, to hesitate in destroying them: but he would surely be of a hard heart who, meeting with a serpent on a desert island, or in a situation where it was incapable of injury, should wantonly deprive it of existence. A Necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt; the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him: he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes; whilst cowardice, curiosity, and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of free-will.|$|E
60|$|Many {{people seem}} {{to find the most}} {{interesting}} figure in the book that stoical father, whose austere, energetic, imperious, and relentless character showed the temperament of the Scotch Covenanter of the seventeenth century, inspired by the principles and philosophy of France in the eighteenth. No doubt, for those in search of strong dramatic effects, the lines of this strenuous indomitable nature are full of impressiveness.[3] But one {{ought to be able to}} appreciate the distinction and strength of the father, and yet also be able to see that the distinction of the son's strength was in truth more really impressive still. We encounter a modesty that almost speaks the language of fatalism. Pieces of good fortune that most people would assuredly have either explained as due to their own penetration, or to the recognition of their worth by others, or else would have refrained from dwelling upon, as being no more than events of secondary importance, are by Mr. Mill invariably recognised at their full worth or even above it, and invariably spoken of as fortunate accidents, happy turns in the lottery of life, or in some other quiet fatalistic phrase, expressive of his deep feeling how much we owe to influences over which we have no control and for which we have no right to take any credit. His saying that 'it would be a blessing if the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> could be believed by all quoad the characters of others, and disbelieved in regard to their own' (p. 169), went even further than that, for he teaches us to accept the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> quoad the most marked felicities of life and character, and to lean lightly or not at all upon it in regard to our demerits. Humility is a rationalistic, no less than a Christian grace--not humility in face of error or arrogant pretensions or selfishness, nor a humility that paralyses energetic effort, but a steadfast consciousness of all the good gifts which our forerunners have made ready for us, and of the weight of our responsibility for transmitting these helpful forces to a new generation, not diminished but augmented.|$|E
40|$|The {{common law}} of England {{recognises}} three species of bias: actual bias, apparent bias and presumed bias. Actual bias exists when a judge {{is in fact}} prejudiced {{against one of the}} parties. Apparent bias, which is also known as preceived and ostensible bias, occurs when the hypothetical fair-minded and informed observer believes that the judge may be biased. Finally, a judge is presumed to be biased if he has an interest, not necessarily pecuniary, in the outcome of the proceedings. A litigant who shows that a decision is infected with bias, of any type, has a right to have the decision set aside. Equally, if a litigant demonstrates, in advance of a decision being made, that the decision would be tainted with bias, the judge before whom the proceedings are listed is required to disqualify himself. these principles are subject only to the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> and waiver...|$|R

The new and wary Alexander II of Russia waited some years {{so as not to}} antagonize the British, then Russia expanded into Central Asia in two campaigns.
