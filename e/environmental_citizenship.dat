Within {{the last three decades}} this model has successfully translated the understanding of disability from being a private trouble to a public concern. This redefinition shifts the focus away from the tragedy of afflicted individuals, replacing this with socio-political discourses of contested <b>citizenship,</b> <b>environmental</b> barriers, and economic and social disadvantage. Accordingly the phenomenon of disability is presented as a public sphere concern and the individual experiences of oppression are harnessed and presented as universal grievances...|$|R

40|$|Debates {{about how}} to foster green/environmental {{citizenship}} have been central to environmental politics research {{in the past few}} decades. While a great deal of this work draws its central tenets from liberal political theory more recently researchers have adopted broadly post-structural analytical frameworks to explore how diverse forms of (<b>environmental)</b> <b>citizenship</b> are formed and enacted. But what can and does this ‘green governmentality’ literature contribute to our understanding of <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship?</b> In exploring such a question, some key environment and citizenship debates, including the recent post-structural turn, are examined. Research into domestic sustainable consumption and public deliberation around climate change is drawn upon to outline how both forms of intervention worked to produce incomplete and conditional expressions of intent and commitment that could be viewed as <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Green governmentality analysis thus highlights some conceptual and empirical blind spots in prevailing environmental citizenships frameworks whilst raising further questions about appropriate and effective public intervention mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{study of}} job {{performance}} {{has been a}} high priority for organizational researchers and practitioners alike. Models of performance have acknowledged that it is affected by both individual differences and environmental factors and also that behaviors outside the job description, called citizenship performance, have value. Despite these acknowledgements, researchers have placed much more emphasis on understanding the influence of individual differences (rather than <b>environmental</b> characteristics) on <b>citizenship</b> performance. Counter to the emphasis on individual differences, the current study sought to evaluate the relationships between <b>environmental</b> characteristics and <b>citizenship</b> performance {{in the context of the}} Job Characteristics Model (JCM) and to determine whether the relationships could be both theoretically and empirically understood. Additionally, the relative importance of the environmental variables in the JCM were evaluated and compared to well-known individual difference predictors of citizenship performance. Finally, the current study sought to provide initial evidence for different patterns of relationships between the JCM variables and the three facets of citizenship performance. Undergraduate students employed for at least 20 hours per week were recruited for participation (n = 379) in a cross-sectional study, and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and regression. Generally, model tests revealed that the JCM as configured performed poorly, though the variables did predict citizenship performance. When job satisfaction was added as another mediator in the model, results were slightly better. Regarding incremental validity, JCM variables were able to explain variance above and beyond the individual difference variables, providing additional support for the importance of the environment in understanding behavior. One implication of this is that practitioners may be able to justify changes to the work environment in an effort to increase citizenship performance. Future research should continue to explore the environment’s effects on citizenship...|$|R

The case of the Zapotillo dam and research methods [...] Chapter 3. Constitutional discourse on the environment, water and citizenship [...] Chapter 4. Acts and institutions of water in Mexico [...] Chapter 5. Civil society and social movements [...] Chapter 6. Community responses [...] Chapter 7. Environmental citizens [...] Chapter 8. Conclusions. This thesis is about the new forms of <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> emerging in Mexico as the state makes {{the political and economic}} transition from authoritarianism to neoliberal forms of democracy. An environmental movement emerged in the 1990 s and created environmental institutions, regulations and policies. Thereafter environmental social movements arose around diverse environmental issues. One of those issues has been large dam projects and environmental conflicts around them. Theories of <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> have been framed by political science, based on the rights and duties of citizens who are members of a political unit, usually based on a democratic model. Empirical research has explored <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> in democratic and developed countries more than developing countries – where citizenship is shaped by different socio-economic processes. In Latin America, complex socio-political systems and different levels of democratic quality have shaped <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The contribution of this thesis is to research what <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> translates into in developing contexts, which are undergoing democratic transitions. It pursues, in particular, the case of Mexico which, despite the democratic advances of recent decades, still bears the historic imprint of its earlier authoritarianism. An innovative array of experimental methods is used to approach <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> in order to capture the complexity of the transition in Mexico. Temacapulín and the Zapotillo dam project are analysed at different levels and in different spaces, focusing on the federal constitution, government policies and institutions, civil society, communities, and within individual lives. The study indicates that <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> is emerging as political spaces open up in Mexico, yet these spaces are constrained by history and opportunity, reflecting quite different dimensions to how <b>environmental</b> <b>citizenship</b> is imagined in developed countries. The Zapotillo project is a dam to be built on the Verde River, in Jalisco. The dam would principally supply water to the cities of León and Guadalajara, and to a smaller extent to Los Altos, the region where the dam is located. The dam would displace three small Los Altos towns: Temacapulín (or Temaca), Acasico and Palmarejo. An environmental movement, led by the community of Temaca, has resisted being displaced for more than eight years and has organised a network of supporters from civil society. The environmental conflict produced by this resistance has obstructed the execution of the project and opened the possibility of its modification to avoid the flooding of the towns, or even the project’s cancellation. This case is analysed using data from the stakeholders in the conflict, i. e. federal government bureau in charge of the dam project, and leaders and participants of the resistance movement, members of the community and external supporters. Data was obtained in interviews with key actors, a participatory research appraisal in the community and a focus group session with external supporters. The data was complemented with documentary research of official documents (e. g. laws, publications, public documents, press conferences and press releases), public information, stakeholder publications and journalistic coverage of the case. Discourse analysis was applied to study the strategies of different actors and the types of environmental discourses that are being used to frame environmental conflicts around dams in Mexico.

40|$|In {{the recent}} upsurge of {{environmental}} concerns worldwide, sustainable consumption issues are more prominent than before on public and political agendas.
