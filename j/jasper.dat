50|$|Captain Britain battles Mad Jim <b>Jaspers</b> in 10 Downing Street but <b>Jaspers</b> proves too {{powerful}} for him. However The Fury enters the battle, beating Captain Britain before tackling <b>Jaspers</b> {{himself in a}} battle which distorts reality itself. During Captain Britain and the Fury's battle, <b>Jaspers</b> takes his time to create an Earth-616 version of the Crazy Gang out of the Earth's soil. Captain Britain would later run into the Crazy Gang on a few occasions in later comics. While it was the Earth-238 <b>Jaspers</b> who constructed the Fury and had programmed it so it couldn't kill him, the Fury recognised that the <b>Jaspers</b> it was now facing was not its creator but an alternate reality counterpart. Thus its rules {{did not apply to}} the Earth-616 <b>Jaspers</b> and the Fury attacked him by incinerating him, something that <b>Jaspers</b> was able to undo with his powers. Also observing this battle were Saturnyne and Captain UK, who had now been convinced to wear her costume by Saturnyne.|$|R

Events mirror those of Earth-238 and <b>Jaspers</b> unleashes the [...] "Jaspers' Warp" [...] upon London. The Fury arrives on Earth-616 and attacks <b>Jaspers</b> after recognising that this <b>Jaspers</b> is not the same man as its creator. After a reality-warping battle, The Fury manages to kill <b>Jaspers</b> by teleporting the pair to the Earth-238 universe, where <b>Jaspers</b> has no reality to control and is powerless. The Fury, weakened by interdimensional travel, is destroyed by the one hero that had escaped from Earth-238, Captain UK. Saturnyne takes a sample of Jaspers' DNA with the intention of cloning him; the DNA is secretly destroyed by Merlyn's daughter, Roma.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the work of the German philosopher Karl <b>Jaspers</b> (1883 - 1969), from his {{beginnings}} as a young psychiatrist to his mature days as an existentialist philosopher. This critical study of <b>Jasper's</b> philosophy traces his effort to instill meaning into the human quest for self-understanding and reveals the difficulties and frustrations inherent in this search. The book presents to the reader <b>Jasper's</b> attempts to deal with these difficulties by means of a philosophical approach to the concept of being as a whole, beyond the individual – the other, the world and transcendence. In this book the author conducts an ongoing dialogue with existing research on <b>Jasper's</b> works and proposes a new reading for them. Along with a critical interpretation, the author reveals the challenges that the figure of <b>Jaspers</b> posed to his readers. Unlike most researchers, who ignored <b>Jasper's</b> early writings dealing with psychiatry and psychology, this book proposes a philosophical reading of these works, revealing the unity {{of the world in which}} <b>Jaspers</b> created – first as a psychologist and later as a philosopher. This approach enables the reader to discover in <b>Jasper's</b> work a daring effort to formulate an original philosphy regarding two basic concepts central to philosophy and human culture throughout all times – "selfhood" and "being"...|$|R

5000|$|In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), <b>Jaspers</b> {{gave his}} view of the history of {{philosophy}} and introduced his major themes.

5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, {{but says he}} and the other Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, is a doctor working at the hospital in Forks. His wife is Esme, and Alice, <b>Jasper,</b> Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally adopted children. Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with <b>Jasper</b> and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and <b>Jasper</b> kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from turning into a vampire. In the aftermath of the battle, Bella has suffered a broken leg, and ends up in the hospital, but her mother comes in to visit. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E
