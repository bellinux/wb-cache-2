40|$|The farm can be {{considered}} as the decision unit in the agricultural land management, therefore it is the most suitable scale to analyse the farmers ’ strategies of production. In this paper we describe the results of a comparison between two enquiries carried out in 1992 - 93 and 2009 - 10 on more than 30 farms, corresponding to about 1500 ha of utilised agricultural area (UAA), within the boundaries of the San Rossore, Migliarino, Massaciuccoli Regional Park (central-western Italy). We calculate a set of agri-environmental indicators both at terri-tory and farm scale in order to point out the changes occurred over almost twenty years in the farms ’ structure, management and produc-tion features. The results showed that the major differences were relat-ed to fertilisers management (clearly decreasing), to the reduction of some crop types (industrial crops) and to the strong decrease of the <b>gross</b> <b>marketable</b> <b>production.</b> Furthermore, apparently stable indica-tors, such as the utilised agricultural area and the farm tractors ’ power, were actually the result of the compensation of contrasting trends. Farmers ’ behaviours were substantially homogeneous within the same typology of farm, highlighting common evolution strategies. The desir-ability of the occurred changes was also evaluated, underlining the improvement of environmental sustainability of the current cropping systems and a greater social acceptability of agricultural activities, while the evaluation from the farmers ’ point of view was less satisfac-tory...|$|E
40|$|The fruit {{production}} of Trentino {{is an important}} industry of the local economy with a <b>gross</b> <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of about 215 million Euros with almost 75 % comes by apples. The characteristics of the cultivation environments allow to get quality products. This is {{made possible by the}} constant technical updating operated by technical support of Consulting & Services Centre – CTT. This is one of reasons why IPM has come in the practice since the early 90 ’s and on this view the inspection of sprayers is mandatory and regularly made with five years interval. Many housing districts are scattered among orchards and population of rural surroundings has become more and more sensitive to issues about environmental sustainability and spray drift. Therefore vertical bench tests started to follow the standard procedures of inspection and calibration to carry the operators to a more efficient way of application reducing drift losses. Moreover in the last years has become needful to start a series of test in order to find technical solutions for drift mitigation. In our view the next step to allow an adequate and efficient use of drift reducing devices, and bring them in the practice, is to link inspection and calibration with drift reduction experiences. Informations, suggestions and adjustments are achievable by the technical staff of the inspection facilities (e. g. choice of a proper filter mesh size according with the nozzle type, etc.) during inspection activity. On this view training during inspection has a key role to make the operator conscious of the most appropriate technical choices for efficient use of pesticide application equipments...|$|E
40|$|In ItalyProcessing tomato is {{the first}} Italian {{vegetable}} crop for harvested area (about 94000 ha). A three year “on-farm” open field research on processing tomato was carried out from 2006 to 2008 in a conventional farm in the Serchio Valley (Pisa, Central Italy), {{with the aim of}} testing innovative strategies for non-chemical weed control. The innovative strategy was compared with the farm conventional technique (consisting in chemical treatments and rotary inter-row hoeing interventions). The innovative strategy was carried out by means of the stale-seedbed technique (consisting in a rolling harrowing and flaming treatments) and post-transplanting precision hoeing interventions (with innovative hoes equipped with rigid or rotating tools). All the operative machines were on purpose adapted or modified according to tomato space arrangement. The rolling harrow was equipped with spike disks (placed in the front) and cage rolls (placed at the rear), connected by an overdrive with a ratio equal to 2. The flaming machine was equipped with three 50 cm wide rod burners, for a total working width of 1, 5 m. The precision hoe was equipped with rigid elements for inter-row cultivation, elastic elements for in-row selective weed control and a precision guidance system. With this machine it was possible to till soil and control weeds even inside the crop pairs, without removing the drip irrigation hoses. Furthermore, “V” shaped elements, that allow to “open” crop vegetation during late hoeing interventions, were appositely built. The operative machines performances, weed density during the crop cycle, dry weed biomass at harvest and crop fresh yield were recorded. The innovative strategy allowed to reach significantly higher yield values, an efficient weed control and a relevant increase of <b>gross</b> <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> with respect to conventional management in all the three years of experiment...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of four different shading nets with different colour and shading intensity, on the microclimate and on the crop growth and development of tomato crop, was experimentally investigated. Experiments were carried out during summer of 2003 in Nea Agchialos, Central Greece. The seedlings of tomato were transplanted into the soil and the following parameters were recorded regularly: solar radiation, air temperature and humidity and crop temperature. In parallel, parameters relative to crop growth and development were also measured. The reduction of solar radiation above the crop was proportional to the shading intensity of the net. Similar values of air temperature and air vapour pressure deficit were observed under the shading nets and outside.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{study the effects of}} a new {{polyethylene}} (PE) 'silver' film [with high reflection and absorption in the Near Infrared Radiation (NIR) ] on greenhouse microclimate and on growth and production of a hydroponic tomato crop. The experiments were carried out from November 2004 to July of 2005 in two similar greenhouses covered by different PE films: one covered by a PE film with high reflection and absorption to NIR radiation (NIR-PE) and one by a common PE film (control greenhouse, C-PE). The spectral properties of the cover materials were measured by a portable spectroradiometer equipped with an integrating sphere. The greenhouse and the outside microclimate parameters were recorded. Furthermore, tomato crop growth and production and quality measurements were also carried out. The reflectance and absorbance of the films to radiation from 700 to 1100 nm were found to be 20 and 16 % for the NIR-PE and 12 and 5 % for the C-PE, respectively. The respective values of the transmittance to 400 - 700 nm were 62 and 79 %, for the NIR-PE C-PE, respectively. However, the results of the microclimate measurements showed that the air temperature and vapour pressure deficit levels were similar in both greenhouses. The mean height of the tomato plants measured during winter was higher in the C-PE greenhouse while during summer was higher in the NIR-PE greenhouse. No differences were found in the number of nodes of plants. The leaf area index of the tomato crop was higher under the NIR-PE greenhouse during the summer period. The total crop production was similar between the two greenhouses for both winter and summer period. However, <b>marketable</b> tomato <b>production</b> was higher in the NIR-PE greenhouse.

The effects on 33 tomato volatiles were also analyzed, 11 of them related to main aroma notes and 22 to the background volatile profile. The effect of deficit irrigation on aroma was dependant on climatic conditions and it may either not {{have a significant effect on}} the aroma profile or may lead to higher logodor units in main aroma volatiles. High lycopene cultivars showed higher contents in most volatiles, including some volatiles originated in pathways that have not been related with carotenoid degradation processes. In both the fresh and processing tomato market the improvement of organoleptic and functional quality and the reduction of the impact of agriculture on environment represent main goals. The use of high lycopene cultivars and restricted irrigation would enhance the aroma of materials targeted to quality markets, contributing to increase the efficiency of water use in agriculture...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a new plant biostimulant composition, containing low doses of sodium selenate, glycine betaine and a spray adjuvant. We performed an experiment to test the influence of treatments with this new biostimulant composition, on cabbage and cauliflower crops, cultivated under normal watered and water stress conditions. We aimed to prove that an efficient technology of protective biofortification with selenium of crops would solve two technical problems of cruciferous cultivation into a semi-arid area, with selenium soil deficit: (i) safety supplementation of food chain and, concomitant, (ii) enhanced water use efficiency. Normal watered plants were irrigated {{at a rate of}} 100 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Water stressed cabbage and cauliflower plants were irrigated under deficit conditions, at a 75 % ETc. Six different treatments, including the new biostimulant composition and its ingredients, separate and/or in combination, were applied on cabbage and cauliflower, in a field experiment, organised in split plot design, with three replications. The treatments were applied by foliar spraying, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after seedlings transplantation in the field. During vegetation, physiological parameters (chlorophyll a fluorescence and stomatal conductance) were assayed. After harvesting, yield parameters were determined, for each treatment applied to both normal watered and water stressed plants. We calculated the water use efficiency as ratio between the marketable yield and the water used. We tested in field conditions this new biostimulant composition, which allows to obtain, under conditions of moderate water stress, a <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> {{similar to that of the}} normal watered crop. Physiological parameters demonstrated also enhanced water-use efficiency on cabbage and cauliflower treated with the new biostimulant composition, containing sodium selenate, betaine and spraying adjuvant based on ethyl rapeseedate...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} growth of crops allows the {{planning}} of rational cultivation methods which contribute to achieve greater potential of plant species, besides supplying information {{for the construction of}} descriptive mathematical models of growth. The growth curve of sweet pepper (Eppo hybrid), cultivated in coconut fiber in a greenhouse with fertirrigation, was determined. The experiment consisted initially of 160 plants divided into four blocks. Two plants were analyzed per block every 21 days after transplanting, ending at 189 days after transplant. The cultivation was carried out in plastics pots of 13 L containing coconut fiber, which were arranged in double rows, spaced 0. 5 x 0. 8 m between simple rows and 1. 1 m between double rows. In each harvest the plant growth, production and quality of mature fruits were evaluated. The dry mass of the shoot increased with time, following the experimental model exponential of first order, reaching a maximum of 451. 5 g/plant, 189 days after transplanting (DAT). The production of dry mass of leaves, stem, root and fruit also increased over time reaching maximum values of 68. 7, 65. 8, 11. 5 and 302. 9 g/plant, respectively, at 189 DAT. The same occurred with the leaf area per plant, plant height and the absolute rate of growth, whose maximum values were 6. 183, 5 cm², 136. 9 cm and 4. 4 g/plant/day, respectively. The growth of the plant was continuous throughout the cycle, and the highest amount of dry mass was accumulated in fruits, reaching a <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of 97. 3 t ha- 1.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different cover crops was evaluated over the agronomic performance of tomato hybrids for industrial processing, {{as well as}} its effect over soil chemical attributes. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a split plot scheme, with four replications. Main treatments (plots) were composed of winter cover crops (oat, hairy vetch, clover and radish) and of a fallow area (spontaneous vegetation). Subplots were composed of four processing tomato hybrids (AP 529, AP 533, Kátia and Sicílio). We evaluated the total <b>production</b> (TP), <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> (CP), average mass of marketable fruits (AMCF) and number of marketable fruits (NCF). Chemical analysis of soil was done in two stages: one week preceding implantation of cover crops and in the phase of tomato implantation. Highest TPs were obtained in treatments in which cover crops were composed by hairy vetch and radish. However, although hairy vetch has caused an increase in TP, no difference between covers was obtained in relation to CP. Sicílio hybrid presented the greatest AMCF, however, its TP was lower than expected. This fact is related to lower NCF, which was half of the observed in AP 529 and AP 533 hybrids. Radish cover increased phosphorus, calcium and potassium in soil and this {{could be one of the}} factors responsible for the increase of TP provided by radish. On the other hand, oat has caused inverse effect, reducing availability of Ca and K. All covers have increased organic matter in soil, the major increment being presented by oat. Based on these results we conclude that hairy vetch and radish are the most indicated plants for cover preceding tomato cultivation...|$|R

40|$|Jumla district, {{located in}} the {{mountains}} of western Nepal, belongs to one of the poorest and least developed parts of the world. This thesis examines a value chain of organic apples, which should - besides being a profitable business opportunity - be a method with which to alleviate the poverty in the district of Jumla. While the geography of the region is suitable for the cultivation of apples, {{at the same time it}} provides enormous difficulties for the trade of apples (and other products). As one of the most remote districts in Nepal, Jumla is only connected to the national road system by the Karnali Highway, a dangerous and oftentimes impassable road. Hence, only a small portion (10 %) of the <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of apples in Jumla district can be exported at the moment. This, however, is changing rapidly. By including poor smallholder farmers into the value chain, they gain market access which they previously did not have: This will provide them with new opportunities to improve their livelihoods. There is thus a clear need to comprehend the potential for including poor farmers into the value chain and to understand how people’s livelihoods can and should be improved. For this, however, it is necessary to first understand their livelihood strategies, their assets, and the context they live in. Therefore, this thesis employs a multidisciplinary approach to examine the context, their livelihoods, and how they relate to the value chain. Combining the value chain analysis and the livelihoods approach provides a complete picture of the dynamics that are affecting people’s lives. Furthermore, it should give a more comprehensive and realistic understanding of the structure of certain markets and their potential to improve the livelihoods of poor people...|$|R
40|$|The {{eggplant}} (Solanum melongena L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely cultivated crops in tropical and temperate regions around the world and is suitable for propagation through grafting. In many parts of the world, grafting is a routine technique used in continuous cropping systems, because in the horticulture field is a sustainable technique that allows cultivators to overcome abiotic or biotic stress. The objective of this research was to evaluate the suitability at the grafting of four Sicilian eggplant ecotypes grown in open field in Sicily, Italy. Vegetables in general are a great source of minerals in the human diet and the eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) provides significant quantities of various minerals, among which are P, K, Ca and Mg. The study demonstrated that grafting increased marketable yield. Furthermore, grafting has increased the amount of Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu in the fruit, while reducing the amount of Na, Mg and Mn. This variation is of significant interest, as lower levels of Na and Mn favour a reduction in hypertension and help keep blood pressure under control. Grafted plant height after 35 days is positively correlated with the average number of marketable fruits per plant (r = 0. 607) and percentage of discard production (r = 0. 583). Furthermore, after 35 days, the non-grafted plant’s height was also negatively correlated with the total average production (r = - 0. 528), the average <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> (r = - 0. 558), and the average weight of marketable fruits (r = - 0. 815). This research confirmed that Solanum torvum selection Australys rootstock gave Sicilian eggplant ecotypes increased vigor in the initial 35 days from planting, increased yields while increasing the number of marketable fruit, and creating fruit with more healthful qualities...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the collective model of labor supply with <b>marketable</b> domestic <b>production</b> (Chiappori, 1997). We first show that, if domestic production is mistakenly {{ignored by the}} economist, welfare analyses will be probably distorted. Precisely, the identification of "collective" indirect utilities will be generally biased. The direction {{and the size of}} the bias depend on the complementarity/substituability of spouses' time inputs in the production process. The identification is unbiased if and only if the production function is additive. We then show that, even if domestic labor supplies are not observed by the economist, (i) market labor supplies have to satisfy testable restrictions, (ii) the structure of the model is partially identifiable so that valid welfare comparisons are still possible. Our identification results generalize Chiappori's (1992) ones. Household, Collective Model, Labor Supply, Home Production, Welfare Analysis, Identification...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to determine, for the main species of Eucalyptus grown in the south west of Ireland (Kerry), the best means of pruning to optimise <b>marketable</b> juvenile foliage <b>production</b> and quality over the crops life cycle. The majority of the trials were carried out in Co. Kerry where a higher concentration of production is located. The favourable climate and light acid soils in this region promote satisfactory growth and enables harvesting to take place from autumn to March which is the premium period. Results of extensive trials over a four year trial period showed that new plantations should not be pruned {{until the end of}} the second growing season to allow the trees to become well established and help build up photosynthetic food reserves and prevent tree losses. However in some situations where very vigorous growth was achieved during the first growing season a very light pruning at 1. 3 m high helped stabilise trees. After the second year's growth, pruning back to a height of 1. 2 m consistently produced the highest <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of quality juvenile foliage of Eucalyptus species pulverulenta, perriniana, parvifolia, and 'Glaucescens' over the trial period. Pruning back to this level helped develop a single or multiple main stem framework (2 - 3 stems) for future production purposes, providing a nice manageable tree facilitating not only harvesting but other technical operations such as pruning and spraying. It was found that more severe pruning, especially back to 15 - 25 cm from the ground, reduced output and in some cases quality but was responsible for significant tree losses varying from 8 - 12 % in the second growing year to over 30 % losses with four year plantations, with further losses of 5 - 10 % expected as well because of very weak plants. The main recommendations of this study are that no pruning be carried out for the first two growing seasons and thereafter a relatively light pruning of all main framework leaders back to 1. 2 m high after the winter period. As the plantations grew older, stronger side branches could be shortened and later still could be removed to facilitate management of the crop. The light pruning treatments to 1. 2 m high in contrast to the most severe pruning regimes produced no significant tree losses in the main production areas in Co. Kerry and would appear to be the most sustainable system of pruning management over the crops life cycle. End of Project Repor...|$|R
