5000|$|Having {{scaled back}} their {{operations}} to their core food, funeral, insurance, electrical and legal {{businesses in the}} preceding years, the business set out modernising these businesses {{in order to create}} a stable and profitable base going forward. In April 2015, The Co-operative Group announced that it had reduced its debt levels by approximately 40% (to £808m) and had made a small profit during 2014, but would not pay a dividend to members until 2018. When The Co-operative Group released its annual report in 2016, it showed that its food business was growing faster than the overall grocery market (by 3.2 percentage points) and that like-for-like sales were up 3.8% in its core convenience estate. This reflected the significant growth in the convenience sector in the UK following a shift in consumer habits towards shopping little and often. Owing to their strength in the market, the food business chose to focus on their estate of approximately 2,500 convenience stores, selling over 100 of their larger supermarkets and opening 300 new convenience stores during 2014, 2015 and 2016, particularly in London and the South East of England. The business also sold 298 of its smallest stores to McColls in 2016 with the aim of providing a more consistent shopping experience by focussing on stores primarily in the 2000-4000 square <b>foot</b> <b>bracket</b> where a greater range of own brand products could be sold. The food range in stores was refreshed with a smaller range of items, that were tailored to individual stores, rather than their previous policy of determining product range purely on store size. The Co-op also shifted to a strategy of driving sales by reducing the price and increasing the quality of products, by increasing the proportion of produce produced in the UK and the roll-out of locally sourced products in small clusters of stores (following a successful trial in Yorkshire). As their ethical image had largely recovered after their financial crisis, they focussed attention on differentiating the food business through measures such as by driving a significant increase in sales of Fairtrade goods (sales of Fairtrade products rose 18% during 2016), through being the first major UK supermarket to switch all of its own brand meat (excluding continental meats like chorizo) to being British sourced [...] and through reinventing the Society's membership scheme to include a reward of 5% of spend on own brand items being credited to the member and a further 1% being donated to a local cause of their choosing.|$|E
40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a yielding steel post for underground mine support. The report covers concept development, laboratory tests, modifications, and field evaluations. The objective of this work was to develop a stiff support member capable both of supporting high loads and yielding when excessive amounts of mine entry closure were present. The 6 -to 7 -ft steel post was designed to yield nearly 2 ft while maintaining a 45 -ton (force) load. The post is a three-piece unit consisting of top and bottom telescoping legs and a separate <b>foot</b> <b>bracket.</b> It develops its load-carrying characteristics when the lower pipe, with an attached interference ring, is forced into the larger top pipe. Laboratory tests were used to determine critical loads and post performance for various post lengths. Field tests showed that the posts could perform in actual mining conditions. The post has the ability to provide support in highly yielding ground and also, because of its slender profile, enhance ventilation and provide more area for travelways and escapeways. The design is simple enough to allow for fabrication at most mine shop facilities...|$|E

40|$|During {{the celebration}} of the 40 th anniversary of the University of Southern Queensland, an artistic concept was put to merge the Australian {{tradition}} of using windmills with the advanced usage of composite materials. With the main structural system based on fibre composite sandwich construction, its behavioural issues and failure modes are presented. The FE modelling considerations for this type of structure is presented. Limited experimental program was conducted to investigate the behaviour of sandwich panel under compression and verify the test results with the FE analysis approach. To assess the suitability of the connection between the fibre composite tower and the <b>footing,</b> prototype <b>brackets</b> that comprised from all-composite infill and steel plate infill were tested under tension to assess their load carrying capacity. This experiment showed that using all-composite brackets achieved higher capacity when compared to composite skins filled with steel plate. The paper concludes with general discussion of using composites for the main structural elements...|$|R

The result is this masterful work suffers from broken <b>bracket</b> <b>feet,</b> which was often attached with a glue block which ran perpendicular to the base pieces. The glue blocks were fastened with both glue and nails, resulting in unequal expansion and contraction between the pieces. This was also the cause of splitting of wide boards, which were commonly used during that period.|$|R

This thesis deals with development of one such common norm for one of the products (Roof rack component) for company Thule. The main aim of the thesis is to curtail the products lead time to market and this was achieved by using an artificial intelligence technique i. e., Case-based reasoning (CBR). Roof rack component which is mounted on car roof is mainly constituted by two parts <b>foot</b> pad and <b>bracket,</b> this thesis main interest was concerned with only brackets and its geometry. This thesis is based on contemplating the already implemented concepts in this context, designer requirements and exploring better solutions. The methods of implementation adopted here was using CBR concept which is based on indexing, retrieve, adapt, review, retain and employing these concepts in form of an algorithm. The concept for developing the algorithm was based on Iterative closest point (ICP) approach which emphasise on assigning lower weight to pairs with greater point to point distance. The results portrayed are with respect to geometry and also with respect to application interface developed, which both together provides us a better solution...|$|R
50|$|The Dalling Cabinets, {{a pair of}} Anglo-Indian Vizagapatam ivory bureau cabinets, circa 1786, on ebonised {{and parcel}} gilt stands, c1810, were made for Dalling near Madras and brought home to Britain.Each is inlaid overall with panels {{depicting}} buildings, trees and flowers, surrounded by borders of scrolling foliage, with triangular open pediment above a frieze drawer and three pigeon-holes and three drawers flanked by doors enclosing two pigeon-holes and three drawers, above a hinged flap enclosing a fitted interior of pigeon-holes and drawers divided by column-drawers, above a long drawer fitted with divisions, on <b>bracket</b> <b>feet,</b> the interior and carcase in satinwood, on a rounded rectangular stand with solid three-quarter gallery above a reeded frieze, on spirally-fluted tapering legs and ring-turned tapering feet, minor variations in size and decoration, the pediment now positioned at the rear edge.These engraved bureau-cabinets, serving as portable desk jewel-case and dressing-box, are designed as a miniature 'desk and bookcase' with Roman-temple pediment. Engraved tablets, wreathed by floral 'chintz' fashioned borders, portray magnificent villa landscapes. This artistic India-flowered furniture, crafted in ivory veneer, was retailed in Madras and Calcutta by the English and Dutch East India Companies; but it was primarily manufactured in Vizagapatam, on the northern Coromandel Coast. Two other related cabinets, from the estate of Alexander Wynch, a former East India Company Governor of Fort St. George, were acquired in the 1770s by George III.They measure: (overall) 57¼ inches high; 26½ inches wide; and 13½ inches deep. The cabinets are 36¾ inches high; 25 inches wide; and 11¾ inches deep.The English stands are 20½ inches high.|$|R
5000|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition {{provided}} a lengthy appreciation of his work: All greatness {{is the product}} of its opportunities, and the elder Boulle was made by the happy circumstances of his time. He was born into a France which was just entering upon the most brilliant period of sumptuary magnificence which any nation has known in modern times. Louis XIV, so avid of the delights of the eye, by the reckless extravagance of his example, turned the thoughts of his courtiers to domestic splendors which had hitherto been rare. The spacious palaces which arose in his time needed rich embellishment, and Boulle, who had not only inherited the rather flamboyant Italian traditions of the late Renaissance, but had ébénisterie in his blood, arose, as some such man invariably does arise, to gratify tastes in which personal pride and love of art were not unequally intermingled. He was by no means the first Frenchman to practice the delightful art of marquetry, nor was he quite the inventor of the inlay of brass or pewter and tortoiseshell which is associated with his name; but no artist, before or since, has used these motives with such astonishing skill, courage and surety. He produced pieces of monumental solidity blazing with harmonious color, or gleaming with the sober and dignified reticence of ebony, ivory, and white metal. The Renaissance artists chiefly employed wood in making furniture, ornamenting it with gilding and painting, and inlaying it with agate, cornelian, lapis lazuli, marble of various tints, ivory, tortoiseshell, mother-of-pearl, and various woods. Boulle improved upon this by inlaying brass devices into wood or tortoiseshell, which last he greatly used according to the design he had immediately in view, whether flowers, scenes, scrolls, etc.; to these he sometimes added enameled metal.Indeed the use of tortoiseshell became so characteristic that any furniture, however cheap and common, which has a reddish fond that might by the ignorant be mistaken for inlay, was described as Buhl in the nineteenth century. The name is the invention of a British auctioneer and furniture maker. In this process, the brass is thin, and, like the ornamental wood or tortoiseshell, forms a veneer. In the first instance, the production of Boulle's work was costly, owing to the quantity of valuable material that was cut away and wasted, and, in addition, the labor lost in separately cutting for each article or copy of a pattern. By a subsequent improvement, Boulle effected an economy by gluing together various sheets of material and sawing through the whole, so that an equal number of figures and matrices were produced at one operation. Boulle adopted from time to time various plans for the improvement of his designs. He placed gold leaf or other suitable material under the tortoiseshell to produce such effect as he required; he chased the brasswork with a graver for a like purpose, and, when the metal required to be fastened down with brass pins or nails, these were hammered flat and disguised by ornamental chasing. He also adopted, in relief or in the round, brass <b>feet,</b> <b>brackets,</b> edgings, and other ornaments of appropriate design, partly to protect the corners and edges of his work, and partly for decoration. He subsequently used other brass mountings, such as claw feet to pedestals, or figures in high or low relief, according to the effect he desired to produce. These mounts in the pieces that undoubtedly come from Boulle's atelier are nearly always of the greatest excellence. They were cast in the rough; the tools of the chaser gave them their sharpness, their minute finish, and their jewel-like smoothness.Unhappily {{it is by no means}} easy, even for the expert, to declare the authenticity of a commode, a bureau, or a table in the manner of Boulle and to all appearance from his workshops. His sons unquestionably carried on the traditions for some years after his death, and his imitators were many and capable. A few of the more magnificent pedigree-pieces are among the worlds mobiliary treasures. There are, for instance, two famous armoires, which fetched 12,075 at the Hamilton Palace sale; the marquetry commodes, enriched with bronze mounts, formerly in the Bibliothèque Mazarine; various cabinets and commodes and tables in the Louvre, the Musée de Cluny and the Mobilier National; the marriage coffers of the dauphin which were in the San Donato collection. There are several fine authenticated pieces in the Wallace Collection at Hertford House, together with others consummately imitated, probably in the Louis Seize period. On the rare occasions when a pedigree example comes into the auction room, it invariably commands a high price; but there can be little doubt that the most splendid and sumptuous specimens of Boulle are diminishing in number, while the second and third classes of his work are perhaps becoming more numerous. The truth is that this wonderful work, with its engraved or inlaid designs; its myriads of tiny pieces of ivory and copper, ebony and tortoiseshell, all kept together with glue and tiny chased nails, and applied very often to a rather soft, white wood, is not meet to withstand the ravages of time and the variations of the atmosphere. Alternate heat and humidity are even greater enemies of inlaid furniture than time and wear. Such delicate objects were rarely used, and the most talented of the artists were employed by the crown.|$|R
