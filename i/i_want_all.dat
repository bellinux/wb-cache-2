500|$|An {{untitled}} {{hidden track}} follows [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] and has Nas rapping {{from the perspective}} of his prenatal self. It was originally recorded for I Am... and had planned titles [...] "Fetus" [...] and [...] "Belly Button Window". The track opens with solemn guitar chords and the sound of bubbling liquid before being overlaid with a beat and a piano riff. An introductory verse is delivered by Nas in a spoken word tone: [...] "Yeah. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>all</b> my niggas to come journey with me / My name is Nas, and the year is 1973 / The beginning of me / Therefore I can see / Through my belly button window / Who I am." [...] The narrative follows the time before his birth, covering subject matter such as his parents fighting and his expectations for life. In [...] (2009), writer Adam Bradley denotes the track's lyrical narrative of an MC's story of birth as [...] "one of the core narratives in rap", having its roots in a similar autobiographical convention found in African-American slave narratives. Of Nas' narrative, Bradley states, [...] "By endowing the insensible with voice, he aspires to an expressive level that transcends speaking for oneself, or of oneself, to one that self-consciously constructs itself as an artist giving shape to that which lacks coherence." ...|$|E
500|$|Another early {{influence}} was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams's words, [...] "It was now that Holst discovered {{the feeling of}} unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a great teacher. A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." [...] At Kelmscott House, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, [...] "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>all</b> persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according {{to the amount of}} money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, [...] "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." [...] He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.|$|E
500|$|She {{continues}} telling to {{the crowd}} that she would sing a song from Dangerously in Love further asking the attendees {{how many of them}} have the album. She then introduces [...] "Be with You" [...] as one of her favorite slow jams and starts singing it. For the beginning of [...] "Speechless" [...] she sits on a chair singing the song. She asks the fans in the arena to cheer and announced [...] "Well, this is my very first solo tour as an artist and I'm very happy to share this wonderful experience with you all tonight in London". She then starts performing a short Destiny's Child medley beginning with [...] "Bug a Boo". Beyoncé then tells the story about the group's first single [...] "No, No, No Part 2" [...] and continues performing the song. [...] "Bootylicious", [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'", [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women Part I", [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] are performed afterwards as part of the medley. She introduces the next song [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] saying that she wrote it for all the ladies, [...] "I thought it was something we all need to hear. When we get in these relationships they don't work out. Sometimes we blame the man, we blame another girl, we blame ourselves. But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it, even the bad experiences and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>all</b> the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves. You'll always have yourself." [...] She introduces the next song [...] "Summertime" [...] as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen. The lights go out again and Beyoncé appears wearing a grey, sparkly dress for an extended performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] surrounded by smoke. After the word [...] "Beyoncé" [...] is written on the screen several times, she appears on a staircase wearing a long shirt as the opening lines of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] start and the song's music video is projected on the screen. Beyoncé then continues singing the song and performing its choreography with her female background dancers and confetti are dropped on stage during the end of the performance.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{sell their}} extra tickets on StubHub at a profit, often tickets {{which are in}} high demand which are {{difficult}} to find. While concert tickets can get expensive when the demand is high, {{more than half of}} all tickets sold on StubHub go for at or below face value. Tsakalakis has stated that he believes the ticket market is not a level playing field for the average person, in that before a ticket goes on sale, promoters have already sold the vast majority of seats to everyone from fan club members, American Express card holders and ticket brokers. He has said, [...] "There is this whole mentality within concerts that if it doesn't sell out right away it's not a hit. It just doesn't make sense. Nothing works that way. There isn't a supplier out there that says, 'The first day I put my product out there <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>all</b> of it to sell out and I don't want to have any more supply.' What business works that way?" [...] Sellers choose what they want to charge for the ticket. A range of tickets are listed, mainly sporting, concert, theater, and other live entertainment events. Music categories are divided into Classical and Vocal, Country and Folk, Dance and Electronica, Jazz, Blues and RnB, Rock, Pop and Hip-Hop, and World and New Age music. Theatre and comedy is organized by Cirque du Soleil, Classical music and opera, dance/ballet, family, festivals and fairs, film festival, museum, musicals, play, and other/miscellaneous.|$|E
