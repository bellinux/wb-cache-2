His practice shapes a unique hybrid art form and generates new vocabularies. <b>Double</b> <b>Exposures</b> is Vason’s new collaborative venture with {{some of the most}} visually arresting artists working with performance in the UK. Ten years after his groundbreaking book Exposures, Vason has produced another extraordinary body of work, which sets out new ways of bridging performance and photography. For <b>Double</b> <b>Exposures,</b> Vason worked with two groups of artists, using two distinct types of collaboration, to produce a series of double images. All the images exist as doubles – pairs – diptychs. In photography, a ‘double exposure’ can be accidental or deliberate. Both types permeate <b>Double</b> <b>Exposures,</b> making it Manuel Vason’s most ambitious project to date...|$|R

In addition to his appearing role with Roy Scheider, his character often appears in video dispatches transmitted to the American astronauts in the film. While continuing to guest star in many television series and appearing in several feature-length films, McEachin landed his most memorable role, that of police lieutenant Brock in the 1986 television movie Perry Mason: The Case of the Notorious Nun. He would reprise this role {{in more than a}} dozen Perry Mason telemovies from 1986 until 1995, starring opposite Raymond Burr, and appeared in the 1994 crime thriller <b>Double</b> <b>Exposure.</b>|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, Lohan was {{the subject}} of a fashion shoot in the {{photographer}} docu-series <b>Double</b> <b>Exposure</b> on Bravo. Robert Rodriguez's action exploitation film Machete opened in September 2010. In the film, Lohan's character takes drugs, is naked in much of her appearance, and later dons a nun's habit while toting a machine gun. Its critical reviews were mixed. The Washington Post described her character as [...] "a campier, trampier version of herself – or at least her tabloid image." [...] Premiere.com said she was [...] "terrible" [...] while Variety called it [...] "her best work in some time." [...] Because of her rehabilitation and legal engagements, Lohan did not participate in promotion of the movie. Lohan filmed a sketch where she is dressed as Marilyn Monroe for Inappropriate Comedy in 2010. The film had issues finding a distributor and was not released until 2013, when it was met with poor box office and critical reception. Lohan appeared on the October 2010 cover of Vanity Fair. She told the magazine: [...] "I want my career back" [...] and [...] "I know that I'm a damn good actress." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via <b>double</b> <b>exposure.</b> Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was {{pushed away from the}} refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it holds}} {{significant}} differences from Remember Me, the game addresses similar themes {{of memory and}} identity. Life Is Strange was specified as an analogue look at human identity in contrast to Remember Me, the digital view of the same theme. Running on an improved version of Unreal Engine 3, it makes use of the tools and special effects like lighting and depth of field engineered for Remember Me as well as subsequent advances. Visual effects like post-processes, <b>double</b> <b>exposure</b> and overlapping screen space particles were used as an artistic approach to be displayed while the lead character rewinds time. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called [...] "impressionistic rendering". Elements were adjusted based on player feedback, with influences like The Walking Dead, Gone Home and Heavy Rain in mind. The Catcher in the Rye was an additional source of inspiration, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the game's lead. The characters were created using known archetypes, at first to establish an entry point for the player, and then to subvert them. For the sake of serving the realism, the supernatural elements were designed {{as a metaphor for}} the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle the subject of teen suicide. Twin Peaks also influenced the setting and characters, and is referenced within the game.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of <b>double</b> <b>exposure,</b> and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. In one scene, the appearance of the wife was described as being facilitated by [...] "trick printing", and was possibly created by a <b>double</b> <b>exposure.</b> Bowers notes that the sister was listed as the wife in the official synopsis, but it is unlikely that such a distinction in cast roles was ever made in the inter-titles due to the confusion. Bowers stated that names were used in to keep track of who was who, but patrons were unaware of the characters' names.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Persistent organic {{pollutants}} {{may affect the}} immune and respiratory systems, but available evidence is based on small study populations. We studied the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as continuous variables (per <b>doubling</b> <b>exposure)</b> and as cohort-specific tertiles. Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per <b>doubling</b> <b>exposure</b> = 1. 03 [95 % confidence interval = 1. 00 - 1. 07]). When these outcomes were analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period (RR per <b>doubling</b> <b>exposure</b> = 1. 06 [1. 01 - 1. 12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze. No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure {{may be associated with}} respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18 months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms...|$|R
