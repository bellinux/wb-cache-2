50|$|The Early Honors Program {{is both an}} {{alternative}} to the {{senior year in high school}} and a challenging springboard into college. During both semesters, Early Honors students enroll in a common university-level curriculum which is intended to satisfy the senior level requirements of the Anchorage and Mat-Su School Districts. Depending on the student's remaining requirements, they will have the opportunity to select courses from the Alaska Pacific course catalog relevant to their academic interests. The <b>Fall</b> <b>Block</b> starts off the Early Honors program with Critical Thinking. Students move into the Session in late September and finish their semester by mid-December. Many of the students elect to participate in the Study Abroad option for the Spring Block but alternatives are available on-campus. The Spring Session begins in early February. The Early Honors program is heavily promoted within Anchorage and high school students are very prominent on campus and in classes.|$|E

40|$|This paper review some of {{the aspects}} of {{necessary}} disciplines of geomorphology and roads, with emphasize Soleghan road. For building this road didnt consider geomorphology process carefully. so the safety rang of the road is low and with consider to increasing traffic, the rang of danger is high. Specific subjects {{are related to the}} description of slops phenomena, including rock <b>fall,</b> <b>block</b> slide, rock creep, talus creep, debris flow, rock avalanches and floods. The river process, sloop steep, joint and fault system are the most important geomorphologic information of the Soleghan road. Soleghan road have been studied in this view and thus provide information which take the basis of stability road. Every road in Iran or world can include one or some important process, so some information is needed. More than half of Iran and world roads have built about before 1970, when the geomorphologic education and research was in the early of stage. Therefore many of Iran and world roads such as Soleghan road havent built with new geomorphologic and basic information. Too more damages which in order to geomorphologic process exposed to roads, people and cars in Iran and world such as Soleghan road are increased. Many flood and slumps destroyed built roads, many people and cars, damage or crash to ignoring the geomorphologic information, thus if we use geomorphologic information in road building, damage and crashes will be decreased, so safety will be increase...|$|E

25|$|The Krag–Petersson repeating rifle has a <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> action, i.e. the {{breechblock}} moves downwards as {{the mechanism}} is opened, actuated (operated) by {{the operation of}} the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into a shaped recess on top of the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> rose slightly. The round could then be pushed into the chamber by the shooter, and the breechblock would rise completely. This rising of the breechblock (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.|$|R

40|$|The {{roof line}} of the North Tower of the World Trade Center is shown {{to have been in}} {{constant}} downward acceleration until it disappeared. A downward acceleration of the <b>falling</b> upper <b>block</b> implies a downward net force, which requires that the upward resistive force was less than the weight of the block. Therefore the downward force exerted by the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> must also have been less than its weight. Since the lower section of the building was designed to support several times the weight of the upper block, the reduced force exerted by the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> was insufficient to crush the lower section of the building. Therefore the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> could not have acted as a "pile driver.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the problems pertinent to rockfall activities in highly jointed rock cut slopes, excavated without detailed geotechnical and geological investigations along the right bank of river Sutlej, Luhri, Himachal Pradesh, India. The cut slopes are near vertical to sub-vertical and overhangs are ubiquitous at several locations. Initially, probable zones of slope failure were identified from field inspection and kinematic analysis. The study then uses 2 D rockfall analysis for estimating loss of energy {{due to the}} impact of <b>falling</b> <b>blocks</b> on the slope face and subsequently on the road. Several parameters were also assessed from the study viz. bounce height, travel distance, kinetic energy and translational velocity. The result from rockfall analysis shows that the energy and velocity achieved by the <b>falling</b> <b>blocks</b> are considerably high, capable enough to cause severe damage. In relation to energy and velocity, bounce height achieved is not very large. Because of removal of trees from the slopes face and no measures to capture <b>falling</b> <b>blocks,</b> the problems have been aggravated and therefore, most of the rock covers very large distance to reach up to the valley crossing the roadways endangering travelers and infrastructures. Based on the results, preventive measures have been suggested to prevent future rockfall hazards...|$|R
