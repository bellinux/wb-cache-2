Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Botes to write a synopsis {{of the book and}} they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment. The first film would have dealt with what would become , , and the beginning of , ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith.

25|$|On September 19, 2017, {{during the}} {{question}} and answer session after a special screening of Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3D, James Cameron officially announced that Linda Hamilton will return to the series to reprise her role as Sarah Connor. The story treatment was written by James Cameron himself, serving as the outline for the writer's room. Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a good movie. However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.|$|E
25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows <b>just</b> <b>make</b> it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E

The song [...] "What's My Purpose" [...] is, according to Hopsin, [...] "about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody is doing the same thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has us here to <b>just</b> <b>make</b> money." [...] He also touches on his race-related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida.

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards {{getting back to}} their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying to}} expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and stop worrying about getting played [...] and <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E
