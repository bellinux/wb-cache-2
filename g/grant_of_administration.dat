25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration.</b> There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E
25|$|An {{administrator}} (sometimes {{known as}} the administratrix, if female) acts as the personal representative of the deceased in relation to land and other property in the UK. Consequently, when the estate under administration consists wholly or mainly of land, the court will grant administration to {{the heir to the}} exclusion of the next of kin. In the absence of any heir or next of kin, the Crown has the right to property (other than land) as bona vacantia, and to the land by virtue of the historic land rights of the Crown (and the Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster in their respective areas). If a creditor claims and obtains a <b>Grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>Administration,</b> the court compels him or her to enter into a bond with two sureties that he or she will not prefer his or her own debt to those of other creditors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{persons who}} are {{actually}} given the job {{of dealing with the}} deceased's assets are called [...] "personal representatives" [...] or [...] "PRs".

So, executors obtain a grant of probate that permits them to deal with the estate and administrators obtain a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> that lets them do the same.

2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of a person intestate, or of one who left a will without {{appointing}} [...] executors, or when the executors appointed by the will cannot or will not act, the Probate Division of the High Court of Justice or the local District Probate Registry will appoint an administrator who performs similar duties to an executor. The court does this by <b>granting</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> to the person so entitled, who must hire a lawyer to get this process started. <b>Grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> may be either general (where the deceased has died intestate) or limited.

(Nicholas Mewes, who became free in 1576, had served William Chester junior: William Wilmer, who had served with one William Chester, completed his term that year with Ambrose Saunders, brother of the martyr Lawrence.) His mansion in Lombard Street, which he had leased to Richard Offley, was later sold to Sir George Barne (who died in 1593) by William Chester, his son and heir.

50|$|As {{a leading}} {{member of the}} Clothworker's Company, Osborne was {{frequently}} appointed by the crown, alone or with others, to adjudicate in commercial disputes, especially those relating to the cloth trade. Like other merchants, Osborne had considerable money transactions with the principal personages of his time. Osborne was knighted at Westminster on 2 Feb. {{in the year of}} his mayoralty, and was also elected to represent the city in parliament in 1586. He died in 1591, and was buried at St. Dionis Backchurch, where a monument existed to his memory until the destruction of the church in the Great Fire of London. Soon after his marriage he appears to have lived in Sir William Hewett's house in Philpot Lane, as all his children were baptised in the parish church of St. Dionis. The Yorkshire estates, also left by his father-in-law, were too distant for residence, and Osborne made his country home at Parslowes, where he built a manor-house of moderate pretensions. He left no will, and no <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of his estate is on record. It is probable that he settled his whole estate by deed {{at the time of his}} second marriage.|$|E
