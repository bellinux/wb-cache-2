40|$|The {{import of}} diverse nucleus-encoded {{proteins}} into chloroplasts {{is crucial for}} plant life. Although this crosstalk is mainly dependent on specific transit peptides, it has been recently reported that a non protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) based on a viroid-derived sequence (vdRNA) and acting as a 5 ′ UTR-end mediates the functional import of <b>GFP-mRNA</b> into chloroplasts. This observation unearths a novel plant cell-signaling pathway {{able to control the}} accumulation of the nuclear-encoded proteins in this organelle. The mechanisms regulating this chloroplastspecific localization remain yet unclear. To unravel the functional nature of this chloroplastic signal, here we dissect the 5 ′UTR-end responsible for the chloroplast targeting. A confocal microcopy analysis in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves of the transcripts expression carrying partial deletions of the 5 ′UTR-end indicates that an internal 110 nucleotides-length fragment is sufficient to mediate the traffic of functional <b>GFP-mRNA</b> into chloroplasts. However, the capability of this motif to act as a chloroplastic localization signal was enhanced when fused to either the 5 ′ or the 3 ′ region of the vd- 5 ′ UTR sequence. These findings suggest that the chloroplast-specific RNA targeting is dependent on a structural motif rather than on the RNA sequence...|$|E
40|$|Much {{of biology}} in {{multicellular}} development {{depends upon the}} exchange of messages between cells: by exchanging chemical or mechanical information, cells influence the state of other cells near them and act in a coordinated fashion. Many tissue patterning events such as migration, proliferation and differentiation that occur in vivo, occur in relation to changes in local microenvironment of a cell. The ability to modify two dimensional specially-shaped areas of the local microenvironment with controlled delivery of genes and proteins in patterned shapes allows more biologically-relevant manipulations of a complete system’s development. Such ‘hacking’ tools are limited at this time and our technology provides a biological tool to study more of such developmental mechanisms. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the design, fabrication and application of microfabricated interfaces for the patterned delivery of foreign molecules and gene constructs into developing embryos and cells. Low voltage microfluidic valves and pumps were designed to deliver multiple compounds in pixel style resolution into growing embryos. Other systems were used to ‘draw’ two-dimensional patterns of tracer molecules, DNA and mRNA into the yolk and cells of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) {{at different stages of}} development. The successful delivery of two-dimensional patterns of trypan blue (normal dye), texas red (fluorescent dye), pCS 2 eGFP DNA and <b>GFP-mRNA</b> in both chorionated and dechorionated embryos was also demonstrated. Both DNA and mRNA were expressed in the desired patterns subsequent to delivery. Briefly, 10 µm wide platinum electrodes were microfabricated into desired patterns and passivated with silicone. Square pulses of 10 - 20 V (0. 20 - 0. 40 kV/cm), 50 - 100 ms pulse width were sufficient to create transient pores and introduce compounds from the late blastula period (3 hpf) to early pharyngula period (24 hpf) embryos. Using 24 hpf dechorionated embryos, we achieved a high survival rate of 91. 3 % and 89 %, and a delivery rate of 38 % and 50 % for GFP- DNA and <b>GFP-mRNA</b> respectively. We believe that these simple techniques offer the unique advantages of introducing foreign compounds at local sites and in specific patterns unlike any other microsystem techniques and provide new tools to aid advanced studies in cellular development and morphogenesis...|$|E

30|$|Human and porcine {{cysticercosis}} {{is caused by}} the larval stage of the flatworm Taenia solium (Cestoda). Infestation of the human brain, also known as neurocysticercosis, is the most common parasite disease of the central nervous system worldwide. Significant advances in the understanding of the disease have been achieved using the Taenia crassiceps murine model. We describe here a successful transfection protocol of T. crassiceps cysticerci as the first step to approach a number of currently inaccessible biological questions on cysticercosis. T. crassiceps cysticerci (ORF strain) were microinjected with the plasmid pcDNA 3.1 /NT-GFP-TOPO, encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV). Twelve hours after the microinjection, GFP fluorescence gradually developed in patches associated to bud structures in the bladder wall of cysts. Fluorescence reached a peak at 24 – 48  h and lasted up to 72  h after the microinjection. Immunohistochemical studies on tissue sections of transfected cysts using an anti-GFP antibody, demonstrated co-localization of the antibody and the GFP fluorescence in the tegumentary cytoplasm and subtegumentary cytons. To validate at the mRNA level the expression of GFP, we carried out RT-PCR using two pairs of nested primers. Results showed expression of <b>GFP-mRNA</b> at 24  h post-transfection. Moreover, western blot assays of crude extracts of transfected cysts, carried out using the anti-GFP specific antibody, showed the expected protein band of 27  kDa, demonstrating that the GFP expression started at 24 after plasmid microinjection and was maintained up to 72  h. These findings will facilitate the development of functional genomics approaches applied to this model of cysticercosis.|$|E
