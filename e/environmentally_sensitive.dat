5|$|Exmoor was {{designated}} a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The Exmoor National Park is primarily an upland {{area with a}} dispersed population living mainly in small villages and hamlets. The largest settlements are Porlock, Dulverton, Lynton, and Lynmouth, which together contain almost 40% of the park's population. Lynton and Lynmouth are combined into one parish and are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Exmoor was once a Royal forest and hunting ground, covering , which was sold off in 1818. Several areas within the Exmoor National Park have been declared Sites of Special Scientific Interest due to their flora and fauna. This title earns the site some legal protection from development, damage and neglect. In 1993 an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sensitive</b> area was established within Exmoor.|$|E

Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sensitive</b> area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{has been}} introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At {{the time of its}} introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart.

40|$|Aim. This work {{is devoted}} to intra-population {{variability}} of Botlikh Nitraria schoberi L. (Nitrariaceae). Methods. As the research materials, were used the vegetative and generative organs (shoot, leaf, fruit, seed) collected in 2013 in the natural population of N. schoberi L. on the western micro slopes of the south outskirts of Botlikh village. Results. The studied specimens of Nitraria schoberi L. differ both in absolute terms of features {{as well as their}} degree of variability. This {{may be due to the}} microenvironment for growing as well as genetic and age features. The two-way analysis of variance showed that the significance of differences between the bushes and shoots in the number of internodes and the number of leaves was confirmed at a high level of significance. One-way ANOVA test showed significant interbush differences by the weight of fruits and seeds. All features of the vegetative organs have high variability while features of the generative organs are characterized by low variation. Conclusion. Research revealed the dependence of intrapopulation interbush variation more on the type of shoot (generative or vegetative) than on the characteristics of the bushes themselves. By the features of the fruit, the greatest contribution in intrapopulation interbush variation is made by weight, <b>environmentally</b> more <b>sensitive</b> features than linear features which are more constant. </p...|$|R

40|$|Today {{tourism is}} one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world. Statistics {{revealed}} that in spite of occasional shocks, international tourist arrivals have shown virtually uninterrupted growth: from 25 million in 1950, to 277 million in 1980; to 435 million in 1990, to 675 million in 2000. Worldwide, international tourist arrivals reached 940 million in 2010, up 6. 6 % over the previous year. It can be said that the growth in demand for nature tourism within this international tourist demand has been significant in recent years. Moreover, it is expected to grow steadily by taking into consideration of tourists ‘changing needs and expectations. It is due to the increase in environmental awareness and environmental – sensitive choices of tourists. Today tourists are becoming more aware of the importance of environment and, this forces the hotel industry to pay more attention on <b>environmentally</b> – <b>sensitive</b> approach. As a consequence of these changes and progresses, an accommodation concept called as “eco-hotels ” or “ecolodge ” or “green hotel ” has been occurred. Today, ecolodges are one of the first choices for hotel investments in many destinations. In the study, the samples presented are quite interesting and it is anticipated that with its such aspect, it will be quite beneficial to hotel investors and hotel managers...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} seventies an {{increasing}} {{attention has been paid}} to the impact environmental polict nmight have on foreign trade. One of the most important issues is whether countries with relatively strict environmental regulations tend to experience a deterioration of international competitiveness and thus a fall in exports and a rise in imports, of the pollution-intensive commodities or, on the other hand, benefit from the improvement in <b>environmentally</b> more <b>sensitive</b> industries. So far, most empirical studies have concluded that the proportion of environmental costs to the total production costs is still so marginal that environmental policies have hardly any effect on comparative advantage patterns and thus on foreign trade. One of the few exceptions is Van Beers and Van den Bergh (1997), who found that stricter regulations have some negative impact on bilateral trade flows between OECD countries. The aim of this paper is to show that tyhis outcome is partly due to model mis-specification. The analysis id based on a triple indexed model and on its variants. It is found that, as soon as both the importing and exporting country specific effects are taken into consideration, the relationship between stricter regulations and foreign trade becomes statistically insignificant. This suggests that environmental costs do not have a real impact, neither negative nor positive, on foreign trade. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a general comparative analysis of {{two kinds of}} approach - linear "disciplinary" and non-linear "trans-disciplinary" - used {{in the assessment of}} marginal areas. These approaches reflect different kinds of thinking about marginal areas more than describe specific modelling techniques. The analysis emphasises the key characteristics of each approach, as well as major advantages and disadvantages of each approach's application to define and resolve issues of planning in marginal areas. As a case example for contextualising our discussion of the two approaches, we use our experiences and data from the Sumava Mountains, an <b>environmentally</b> wealthy and <b>sensitive</b> area along the southern boundary of the Czech Republic. Understanding the particular nuances of linear and non-linear approaches in practice will help planners to develop successful solutions to problems in marginal areas. cultural capital; linearity; marginality; national park; non-linearity. ...|$|R

40|$|As the {{complexity}} of the world increases, so does the difficulty of making “right” choices. Businesses are faced with increasing global competition and the simultaneous needs to be flexible and adapt, but also increase efficiency.

Companies are to be profit-driven, stakeholder-focused, and <b>environmentally</b> and globally <b>sensitive.</b> Within this turbulent environment, individuals often feel caught between doing “what has to be done ” and doing what, more ideally, “should be done. ” As pressure for productivity and efficiency increases, time for reflection decreases and decisions often become a matter of expediency.
