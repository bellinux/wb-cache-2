5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated <b>fault-finding</b> system to detect the problem locations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{basic list}} of topics {{to be covered}} was prescribed, but {{it was up to}} the schools to develop this into a three-month {{instructional}} program. Mandatory topics included the following: advanced d-c and a-c circuit theory, electrical motors and generators, vacuum-tube characteristics, power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, modulation techniques, filters and wave-shaping, receiver circuits, transmitter circuits, transmission lines and antennas, and basic electromagnetic propagation theory. Mathematical topics (mainly trigonometry and elementary calculus) were taken up when necessary for developing theoretical equations. Each student built a superheterodyne receiver, and <b>fault-finding</b> was taught using systematic signal-tracing.|$|E

60|$|He always sat at {{the head}} of the table; and this time he squared himself on his bench, and {{erecting}} his knife and fork like flag-staffs, so as to include the two hearts between them, he called out for Danby, the boarding-house keeper; for although his wife Mary was in fact {{at the head of}} the establishment, yet Danby himself always came in for the <b>fault-findings.</b>|$|R
60|$|Those {{simple and}} {{definite}} facts were these: I had {{published an article}} in this magazine, with you for my subject; just you yourself; I stuck strictly to that one subject, and did not interlard any other. No one, of course, could call me to account but you alone, or your authorized representative. I asked some questions--asked them of myself. I answered them myself. My article was thirteen pages long, and all devoted to you; devoted to you, and divided up in this way: one page of guesses as to what subjects you would instruct us in, as teacher; one page of doubts as {{to the effectiveness of}} your method of examining us and our ways; two or three pages of criticism of your method, and of certain results which it furnished you; two or three pages of attempts to show the justness of these same criticisms; half a dozen pages made up of slight <b>fault-findings</b> with certain minor details of your literary workmanship, of extracts from your 'Outre-Mer' and comments upon them; then I closed with an anecdote. I repeat--for certain reasons--that I closed with an anecdote.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1955 he {{graduated}} from Warsaw University. After publishing, in September 1955, a critical article about the construction of Nowa Huta, a Cracow conurbation built on a site chosen as the [...] "first socialist municipality in Poland", which brought to light the inhuman working and living conditions of the labourers involved in the venture—a story which occasioned consternation before eventually winning favour with the Communist authorities unsure at first how to react to a <b>fault-finding</b> depiction of their pet project by one of their own—Kapuściński was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit {{at the age of}} 23.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tredgold choked and, {{meeting the}} <b>fault-finding</b> eye of Mr. Stobell, began to protest.|$|E
60|$|Master Plummer obeyed, {{but with}} an ill grace, for this <b>fault-finding</b> without reason was not agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|The Paladin was disconcerted for a moment, seeing by {{the faces}} around him that Joan had {{put into words}} what the others felt, then he pulled his {{complacency}} together and fell to <b>fault-finding</b> again. Joan's brother Jean said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wotton {{held his}} breath, {{but the old}} lady merely shook her head thoughtfully. [...] "It was a disagreeable voice when his wife used to hear it," [...] she said at last. [...] "Always <b>fault-finding,</b> when it wasn't swearing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had any men to work my vessel," [...] {{said the}} Chilian, {{who had grown}} surly in {{consequence}} of the <b>fault-finding,</b> [...] "I'd leave your negroes here, and cut loose from the whole business. I've had enough of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, March, you're in a <b>fault-finding</b> humour this morning," [...] said Bertram as {{they walked}} towards the camp. [...] "Let's enjoy {{ourselves}} in spite of circumstances. Do you know, I hold it to be exceedingly wise as well as philosophical, {{to make the best}} of things at all times." ...|$|E
60|$|In a word, by {{the simple}} {{expedient}} of shifting the time, in {{the imagination of the}} children, when the advice which he was giving them would come to its practical application, he divested it of all appearance of <b>fault-finding</b> in respect to their present conduct, and so secured not merely its ready admission, but a cordial welcome for it, in their minds.|$|E
60|$|Any {{mother who}} sees and clearly apprehends the {{principle}} here illustrated, and has ingenuity enough to avail herself of it, will find an endless variety of modes by which {{she can make}} use of it, to gain {{easy access to the}} hearts of her children, for instructions and counsels which, when they {{come in the form of}} <b>fault-finding</b> advice, make no impression whatever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think there}} can be any good in going into that. It is at any rate {{the fact that your}} sister is my wife. As this demand has been made upon me it was natural that I should wish to discuss it with some one whom I can trust. I tell you all the facts, but I am not going to listen to any <b>fault-finding</b> as to my past life.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had grown}} very much excited; {{and it was}} as though this {{excitement}} suddenly revealed to me {{the full extent of the}} change that had taken place in him since he had left college. As he stood facing me, almost glaring at me through his eye-glasses, I beheld a slim, nervous, <b>fault-finding</b> doctrinaire, incapable of understanding the world as it was, lacking the force of his pioneer forefathers. I rather pitied him.|$|E
60|$|Master Nugent whistled thoughtfully, and quitting {{the kitchen}} {{proceeded}} upstairs to his room, and first washing himself with unusual {{care for a}} boy of thirteen, put on a clean collar and brushed his hair. He {{was not going to}} provide a suspended master-mariner with any obvious reasons for <b>fault-finding.</b> While he was thus occupied the sitting-room bell rang, and Ann, answering it, left Mr. Wilks in the kitchen listening with some trepidation to the conversation.|$|E
60|$|This {{style of}} {{criticism}} is base and mean, and quite {{contrary to the}} orders of the immortal Goethe, who was only for allowing the eye to recognize the beauties of a great work, but would have its defects passed over. It is an unhappy, luckless organization which will be perpetually <b>fault-finding,</b> {{and in the midst}} of a grand concert of music will persist only in hearing that unfortunate fiddle out of tune.|$|E
6000|$|Finally, in any {{summing-up}} of Burns, though {{so much is}} to be said {{in the way of}} <b>fault-finding,</b> drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary criticism--(in {{the present}} outpouring I have [...] "kept myself in," [...] rather than allow'd any free flow)--after full retrospect of his works and life, the aforesaid [...] "odd-kind chiel" [...] remains to my heart and brain as almost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory) dearest flesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone poets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{in spite}} of my <b>fault-finding</b> I love my children, as I call them, for all are not butterflies. Many find wealth no temptation to {{forgetfulness}} of duty or hardness of heart. Many give freely of their abundance, pity the poor, comfort the afflicted, and make our city loved and honored in other lands as in our own. They have their cares, losses, and heartaches as well as the poor; it isn't all sunshine with them, and they learn, poor souls, that ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't come; {{the neighbors}} brought me," [...] replied the little man, {{with a frown}} at the recollection. [...] "They said I was quarrelsome and <b>fault-finding</b> and blamed me because I told them {{all the things that}} went wrong, or never were right, and because I told them how things ought to be. So they brought me here and left me all alone, saying that if I quarreled with myself, no one else would be made unhappy. Absurd, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{an exaggerated}} opinion of myself, so I know I ain't bragging when I say I'll make {{a pretty good}} husband. You'd find I was no hand at nagging and <b>fault-finding.</b> I can guess {{what it must be}} for a woman like you to be {{independent}}. Well, you'd be independent as my wife. No strings on you. You could follow your own sweet will, and nothing would be too good for you. I'd give you everything your heart desired--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called you}} a shirker, Bob, and ordered Helen {{to leave you}} alone. Now I see you're the better man and I'm a confounded, <b>fault-finding</b> prig. But you're not vindictive, and we'll let that go. The trouble is, I'm obstinate and sure of what I can do--at least, I was, though my {{confidence}} has got shaken recently. Well, I think I can finish this contract, but don't know. I've lost {{a good deal of}} money, and would hate to feel I might lose yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nuttie {{got through}} her morning's work she hardly knew how, though {{her father was}} dry and <b>fault-finding</b> all the time. Her eyes were so full of tears when she was {{released}} that she hardly saw where she was going, and nearly ran against her aunt, who had just walked into the hall. Mrs. Egremont was too prudent a woman to let her burst out there with her grievance, but made her come into the tent-room before she exclaimed, 'He {{is going to take}} me away to London; he won't {{let me go to the}} wedding.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{liked it}} {{even less than}} the bank. The monotony of the sea was appalling to a youth of his tastes, {{and the fact that}} the skipper, a man who never spoke except to find fault, was almost loquacious with him failed to afford him any satisfaction. He liked the mates no better than the skipper, and having said as much one day to the second officer, had no reason {{afterwards}} to modify his opinions. He lived a life apart, and except for the cook, another martyr to <b>fault-finding,</b> had no society.|$|E
60|$|In due time, by {{this kind}} of management, and by other modes {{conceived}} and executed in the same spirit, Bella gained so great an ascendency over the children that they were far more ready to conform to her will, and to obey all her directions, {{than they would have}} been to submit to the most legitimate authority that was maintained, as such authority too often is, by <b>fault-finding</b> and threats, and without any sympathy with the fancies and feelings which reign over the hearts {{of the children in the}} little world in which they live.|$|E
60|$|By nature--and inside--the aged aunts were utterly dear and lovable and good, but in {{the matter}} of morals and conduct their {{training}} had been so uncompromisingly strict that it had made them exteriorly austere, not to say stern. Their influence was effective in the house; so effective that the mother and the daughter conformed to its moral and religious requirements cheerfully, contentedly, happily, unquestionably. To do this was become second nature to them. And so in this peaceful heaven there were no clashings, no irritations, no <b>fault-finding,</b> no heart-burnings.|$|E
60|$|Clan Horsman {{knew too}} well {{what he had}} done to deny him {{anything}} he asked. A man who had not only taken a mad dog by the throat, but had brought home two hundred and twenty pounds worth of gold to lay on the table, deserved something at their hands, though ice was all he actually received; but Eustace, when he came to us while the bride was changing her dress, was in a fretful, <b>fault-finding</b> mood, partly it may be from the desire to assert himself, as usual, above his cousin.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe laughed heartily, but did {{not like}} Bertha's scoffing mirth at Maria's question. Glad as {{she was to be}} at home, her glimpse of the outer world had so {{enlarged}} her perceptions, she could not help remarking the unchildlike acuteness of the younger girl, and the obtuse comprehension of the elder; and she feared that she had become discontented and <b>fault-finding</b> after her visit. Moreover, when Bertha spoke much English, a certain hesitation occurred in her speech which was apt to pass unnoticed in her foreign tongues, but which jarred unpleasantly on her sister's ear, and only increased when noticed.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. There is, perhaps, {{nothing more}} irksome to {{children}} than {{to listen to}} advice given {{to them in a}} direct and simple form, and perhaps there is nothing that has less influence upon them in the formation of their characters than advice so given. And there is good reason for this; for either the advice must be general, and of course more or less abstract, when it is necessarily in a great measure lost upon them, since their powers of generalization and abstraction are not yet developed; or else, if it is practical and particular at all, it must be so with reference to their own daily experience in life--in which case it becomes more irksome still, as they necessarily regard it as an indirect mode of <b>fault-finding.</b> Indeed, this kind of advice is almost certain to assume the form of half-concealed <b>fault-finding,</b> for the subject of the counsel given would be, in almost all cases, suggested by the errors, or shortcomings, or failures which had been recently observed in the conduct of the children. The art, then, of giving to children general advice and instruction in respect to their conduct and behavior, consists in making it definite and practical, {{and at the same time}} contriving some way of divesting it entirely of all direct application to themselves in respect to their past conduct. Of course, the more we make it practically applicable to them in respect to the future the better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carlyle's Paramount Humanity.--I {{believe that}} what Mr. Carlyle loves better than his <b>fault-finding,</b> with all its eloquence, {{is the face of}} any human {{creature}} that looks suffering, and loving, and sincere; and I believe further, that if the fellow-creature were suffering only, and neither loving nor sincere, but had come to a pass of agony in this life which put him at the mercies of some good man for some last help and consolation towards his grave, even at the risk of loss to repute, and a sure amount of pain and vexation, that man, if the groan reached him in its forlornness, would be Thomas Carlyle."[A] ...|$|E
60|$|We {{are very}} apt {{to imagine that}} the {{disposition}} to do right is, or ought to be, the natural and normal condition of childhood, and that doing wrong is something unnatural and exceptional with children. As a consequence, when they do right we think there is nothing to be said. That is, or ought to be, a matter of course. It is only when they do wrong that we notice their conduct, and then, of course, with censure and reproaches. Thus our discipline consists mainly, not in gently leading and encouraging them in the right way, but in deterring them, by <b>fault-finding</b> and punishment, from going wrong.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brooke {{got down}} at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is {{wonderful}} how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we are blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to change their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on their less admirable points; {{and on the other}} hand it is astonishing how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never complain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley's homestead never before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind thus sore about the <b>fault-finding</b> of the [...] "Trumpet," [...] echoed by Sir James.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} in no spirit of <b>fault-finding</b> that she had remarked to her {{daughter}} as to her use of that Christian name. What {{would be better than}} that they should be to each other as Herbert and Clara? But the cautious mother had known how easy it would be to frighten her timid fawn-like child. It was no time, no time as yet, to question her heart about this second lover--if lover he might be. The countess was much too subtle in her way to frighten her child's heart back to its old passion. That passion doubtless would die from want of food. Let it be starved and die; and then this other new passion might spring up.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Those profs are {{the snakes}} to be scotched--they {{and all their}} milk-and-water ilk! The American {{business}} man is generous to a fault. But one thing he does demand of all teachers and lecturers and journalists: if we're going to pay them our good money, they've got to help us by selling efficiency and whooping it up for rational prosperity! And {{when it comes to}} these blab-mouth, <b>fault-finding,</b> pessimistic, cynical University teachers, {{let me tell you that}} during this golden coming year it's just as much our duty to bring influence to have those cusses fired as it is to sell all the real estate and gather in all the good shekels we can.|$|E
