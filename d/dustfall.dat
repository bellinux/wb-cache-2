40|$|One of the {{environmental}} issues was the increasing of air pollution concentration. On the other hand, Bogor Botanical Gardens had high potential as an air quality controller. This study aims to calculate Bogor Botanical Gardens plants ability to reduce CO 2, NO 2, and <b>dustfall</b> emission, analyzing the correlation of leave morphology with the plant ability in absorb <b>dustfall,</b> and determine criteria of plant that can reduce CO 2, NO 2, and <b>dustfall.</b> Total amount of CO 2, NO 2, and <b>dustfall</b> emission and Bogor Botanical Garden sink ability was calculated by secondary data from multiple source unit and its corresponding emission factors. The ability of several plants to absorb <b>dustfall</b> was calculated by gravimetric method using samples from Bogor Botanical Garden. The sample plants were Sansevieria trifasciata, Cinnamomum multiflorum, Callicarpa pedunculata, Carmona retusa, and Antigonon leptopus. The analysis showed that Bogor Botanical Gardens were able to reduce CO 2 emissions by 28. 7 %, NO 2 by 2. 2 %, and <b>dustfall</b> by 11. 4 %. Plant ability to absorb <b>dustfall</b> was 0. 02 - 0. 7 mg/cm 2. The most effective species to absorb <b>dustfall</b> was Carmona retusa with maximum capacity of 0. 7 mg/cm...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to utilize remote sensing and {{ground-based}} spectral data to assess <b>dustfall</b> distribution in urban areas. The ground-based spectral data denoted that dust has a significant impact on spectral features. Dusty leaves have an obviously lower reflectance than clean leaves in the near-infrared bands (780 - 1, 300 nm). The correlation analysis between <b>dustfall</b> weight and spectral reflectance showed that spectroscopy in the 350 - 2, 500 -nm region produced useful dust information and could assist in dust weight estimation. A back propagation (BP) neutral network model was generated using spectral response functions and integrated remote sensing data to assess <b>dustfall</b> weight in the city of Beijing. Compared with actual <b>dustfall</b> weight, validation of the results showed a satisfactory accuracy with a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 3. 6 g/m 2. The derived <b>dustfall</b> distribution in Beijing indicated that <b>dustfall</b> was easily accumulated and increased in the south of the city. In addition, our results showed that construction sites and low-rise buildings with inappropriate land use were two main sources of dust pollution. This study offers a low-cost and effective method for investigating detailed <b>dustfall</b> in an urban environment. Environmental authorities may use this method for deriving <b>dustfall</b> distribution maps and pinpointing the sources of pollutants in urban areas.

40|$|Fugitive dust has {{the ability}} to cause a {{nuisance}} and pollute the ambient environment, particularly from human activities including construction and industrial sites and mining operations. As such, <b>dustfall</b> monitoring has occurred for many decades in South Africa; little has been published on the repeatability, uncertainty, accuracy and precision of <b>dustfall</b> monitoring. Repeatability assesses the consistency associated with the results of a particular measurement under the same conditions; the consistency of the laboratory is assessed to determine the uncertainty associated with <b>dustfall</b> monitoring conducted by the laboratory. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of the uncertainty in <b>dustfall</b> monitoring; thereby improving the confidence in <b>dustfall</b> monitoring. Uncertainty of <b>dustfall</b> monitoring was assessed through a 12 -month study of 12 sites that were located on the boundary of the study area. Each site contained a directional <b>dustfall</b> sampler, which was modified by removing the rotating lid, with four buckets (A, B, C and D) installed. Having four buckets on one stand allows for each bucket to be exposed to the same conditions, for the same period of time; therefore, should have equal amounts of dust deposited in these buckets. The difference in the weight (mg) of the dust recorded from each bucket at each respective site was determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials method D 1739 (ASTM D 1739). The variability of the dust would provide the confidence level of <b>dustfall</b> monitoring when reporting to clients...|$|E
40|$|Dust {{storms in}} North China result in high {{concentrations}} of airborne dust particles, which cause detrimental effects on human health {{as well as social}} and economic losses and environmental degradation. To investigate the impact of land surface processes on dust storms, we simulate two dust storm events in North China during spring 2002 using two versions of a dust storm prediction system developed by the Institute for Atmospheric Physics (IAP) in Beijing, China. The primary difference between the IAP Sandstorm Prediction System (IAPS 1. 0) and more recent version (IAPS 2. 0) is the land surface modeling. IAPS 1. 0 is based on the Oregon State University (OSU) land surface model, whereas the latest version of the dust storm prediction (IAPS 2. 0) uses NOAH land surface schemes for land surface modeling within a meteorological model, MM 5. This work investigates whether the improved land surface modeling affects modeling of sandstorms. It is shown that an integrated sandstorm management system can be used to aid the following tasks: ensure sandstorm monitoring and warning; incorporate weather forecasts; ascertain the risk of a sandstorm disaster; integrate multiple technologies (for example, GIS, remote sensing, and information processing technology); track the progress of the storm in real-time; exhibit flexibility, accuracy and reliability (by using multiple sources of data, including in-situ meteorological observations); and monitor PM 10 and PM 2. 5 dust concentrations in airborne <b>dustfalls.</b> The results indicate that with the new land surface scheme, the simulation of soil moisture is greatly improved, leading to a better estimate of the threshold frictional velocity, a key parameter for the estimating surface dust emissions. In this study, we also discuss specific mechanisms by which land surface processes affect dust storm modeling and make recommendations for further improvements to numerical dust storm simulations...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{increased the}} cohesion potential between particles, reducing {{the ability of}} the particle to be entrained. Dust suppression techniques are designed to increase soil moisture and therefore soil cohesion through the application of water or water-based chemicals to surfaces that have known potential for dust entrainment. Rainfall has the ability to act as a natural dust suppression mechanism; however, there is a paucity of literature on the actual effectiveness of rainfall in this regard. The ASTM D 1739 methods for <b>dustfall</b> monitoring, commonly used in South Africa, and the National Dust Control Regulations (2013), both state that rainfall should be recorded when conducting <b>dustfall</b> monitoring. The rationale is that rainfall or the absence thereof, results in lower or higher <b>dustfall</b> rates, respectively. A suitable study site was identified in Mpumalanga, South Africa. This site had eight non-directional <b>dustfall</b> samplers in the near vicinity of an air quality monitoring station. <b>Dustfall</b> results from the eight samplers were analysed based on four scenarios, two that considers the presence of rainfall and two that consider the absence of rainfall. This analysis was further combined with wind speed data. This study, over a 24 -month period indicates that there is no substantial evidence that above average rainfall will result in below average <b>dustfall.</b> This occurred for one month out of 24 months. Conversely, there is no consensus that the absence of rainfall will result in higher <b>dustfall</b> rates, which occurred cumulatively 30 % of the time. Additional environmental and / or operational information may have a greater influence on <b>dustfall</b> compared to rainfall. Careful consideration should be taken to prevent misrepresentation of causational effects of rainfall on <b>dustfall</b> results. Management of dust should be undertaken through dust mitigation measures irrespective of the natural rainfall regime...|$|E

The source of <b>dustfall</b> in residential area dan road side area usually come from the natural source like soil blow by wind and acumulated in atmosfer, and the antropogenic source came from industrial and moving vehicles emission. The concentration of <b>dustfall</b> was analyze with soluble, insoluble and total solids. SO 42 – is one of anion in soluble that determined through ion chromatography.

The enrichment coecients of the heavy metals in the <b>dustfall</b> were found to be signicant. The enrichment coecients were 12. 1, 6. 1, 11. 7, and 1. 1 for Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{phenomenon in}} urban areas {{is a consequence of}} industrial revolution. Since air pollution destroys the environment, destruction, many countries have devoted research work to this issue and have developed considerable amount of programs to control air pollution. There are a lot of industrial activities in addition to sandstorms that lead to the spread of dust and particles in the air in Yazd city. In this work, <b>dustfall</b> and its relation with climate conditions in Yazd were determined. The study method was descriptive and cross-sectional. The sampling was done from 25 / 8 / 2005 to 19 / 3 / 2006 in 4 month long periods. (end of August-end of September), (end of September –end of October), (end of October-end of November), (19 February- 19 March). The sampling was done in Jomhuri bulevard, Homafar Square, Shahid Beheshti Square, Seyd Gole Sorkh Ave. and Kashani Street by dust fall jar method. Results of this research shows that maximum concentration of dust fall was in the first period equal to 9. 74 g/m². mo and minimum concentration was in the third period (October-November) and was equal to 3. 13 g/m². mo. the maximum concentration was related to Homafar Square (8. 91 g/m². mo) and the minimum concentration was related to Kashani Street was equal to 3. 68 g/m². mo. Concentration average of <b>dustfall</b> in 4 the periods was 6. 49 g/m². mo. The volatile part of <b>dustfall</b> was 50. 6 % and the fixed part was 49. 4 %. Correlations between concentration of <b>dustfall,</b> humidity, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation and the corresponding Pvalue were calculated and the results show that there is a direct relationship between the amount of <b>dustfall</b> and wind speed while humidity and precipitation are inversely proportional to the amount of <b>dustfall.</b> No relationship was found between temperature and <b>dustfall</b> concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{air quality}} in Taiwan area {{is of great}} {{concerned}} by the people. The Environmental Protection Administration regularly monitors the air quality of each city and county in this island and has found that suspended particles is the major component. The suspended particles may sediment via the coagulation and subsequent formation of <b>dustfall.</b> Therefore, the component of <b>dustfall</b> may affect human health. This study was thus to investigate the <b>dustfall</b> from various types of areas of human activity. The <b>dustfall</b> collection stations were classified as background, residential, industrial, campus, traffic-rush, and Techi Reservoir areas. Each season for three months, the <b>dustfall</b> samples were collected and analyzed the physical and chemical properties, which included <b>dustfall</b> solid (amount of dustfall-weight, particle-size analysis, minerals, carbon, and metals) and <b>dustfall</b> solution [pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and the amounts of F-, Cl-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -, and SO 42 -]. In addition, the meteoric data at around the <b>dustfall</b> collection stations were also collected to judge the wind speed and frequencies of wind direction, which were then used for the guidance for collecting the soil samples around the <b>dustfall</b> collection stations. The local soil samples and the soil sample from inner Mongolia were subjected to the same analyses as those of <b>dustfall</b> in order to investigate the correlation between <b>dustfall</b> and soil compositions for each collection area. Based on seasonal period, {{it was found that}} the amount of <b>dustfall</b> in spring 2002 was the most. This is probably because of higher average of wind speed and lower precipitation in that season. Blew soil and street dust at around each <b>dustfall</b> collection station were thus increased and the <b>dustfall</b> particles present in atmosphere enhanced. The averages of the amount of <b>dustfall</b> among the six collection stations were 1. 20 - 2. 01 ton km- 2 month- 1. The highest amount of <b>dustfall</b> was in the campus collection station. The reason is three constructions in campus during the investigation period and the optimum condition of wind speed and wind direction. The amount of the <b>dustfall</b> with the particle size < PM 10 was higher in autumn than in summer. This is due to lower wind speed in autumn. The main minerals in <b>dustfall</b> were quartz, feldspar, mica, and kaolinite. According to the sequence of amount, the metal elements were Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Si. The higher amounts of elements were earth-crust element. K and Mg may be related to fertilization. Na and Si were probably from the sea-salt crystal. The amounts of Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Mn, Cr, and Ti depended on type of collection station and probably from exhaust of motor vehicles and produced from friction of mechanic parts. Ti is commonly present in PM 10 of <b>dustfall.</b> The pH values of <b>dustfall</b> solutions from the collection stations were 5. 5 - 6. 0 except for those close to neutral were from background and Techi Reservoir stations. The reason for the lower pH value is due to exhaust of motor vehicles and human activity. The EC value greatly depended on type of collection station. The lowest pH value but highest EC value of the <b>dustfall</b> solution in autumn 2002. The amounts of dissolved anions were the highest in autumn 2002. This is mainly due to lower cumulative precipitation and lower average of wind speed, which make the difficult diffusion of regional pollutants. It results in the accumulation of NO 3 - and SO 42 - and subsequently dissolution in <b>dustfall</b> solution. In comparison of the properties of <b>dustfall</b> with those of local soil and Mongolia soil, the properties of <b>dustfall</b> are close to those of local soil. 台灣地區空氣品質受各方重視，行政院環保署於台灣各縣市進行空氣品質監測，發現中部地區以懸浮微粒居多，經凝聚成落塵而沉降。因此，大氣落塵成分可能影響人體健康。本研究以人類活動區域型態進行大氣落塵研究，落塵採樣站計六區（背景區、住宅區、工業區、大學校區、交通要衝區、德基水庫區），每三個月（季）為一週期，分析落塵物化性質，包括落塵固體（落塵量、粒徑分佈、礦物、碳元素及金屬元素），落塵溶液（pH值、EC值及F-、Cl-、NO 2 -、NO 3 -、PO 43 -、SO 42 -量）分析。另蒐集落塵採樣站鄰近氣象資料，判定各該採樣期間之風速及風向頻度，以判定採集落塵採樣區週遭土壤。當地土壤、內蒙土壤亦進行與落塵固體相同之分析項目，探討各區大氣落塵組成與各該區土壤組成之相關性。 以季節區分時，發現 2002 年春季落塵量最高，可能原因為該季平均風速較高且累積降雨量較低，吹起鄰近裸露土壤、街塵機會較高，存在大氣之落塵微粒含量較多。各區平均落塵量為 1. 20 - 2. 01 ton km- 2 month- 1 ，以大學校區居高，原因為校內三起興建工程，加上風速風向等氣象條件致使該區落塵量最高； 2002 年秋季各區<PM 10 粒徑之落塵含量較夏季高，其原因應為秋季較小風速之緣故。落塵之主要礦物為石英類、長石類、雲母類及高嶺石。金屬元素以Fe、Al、Ca、Mg、K、Na、Si為多，其含量較高者多為地殼元素，K、Mg元素應與施肥有關，Na、Si元素可能來自海鹽結晶，因區域不同另有Pb、Zn、Cu、Ni、Mn、Cr、Ti等元素，其原因應來自汽機車排放及零件磨損產生，Ti元素易存於落塵PM 10 。落塵溶液之pH值除背景區及德基水庫區接近中性，其他採樣區為 5. 5 - 6. 0 ，原因應為汽機車進出頻繁及其他人類活動造成。EC值因區域而差異甚大， 2002 年秋季落塵之pH值最低，然而，EC值卻最高；落塵之可溶性陰離子濃度以 2002 年秋季為最高，原因應為秋季累積降雨量較低，平均風速低造成區域污染物不易擴散，NO 3 -及SO 42 -累積並溶入落塵溶液。落塵與當地土壤、內蒙土壤之物化性質比對，發現落塵與當地土壤較類似。摘要 ……………………………………………………………….

From October 1996 to September 1997 samples of suspended particles (1 site) and <b>dustfall</b> (6 sites) were collected in the vicinity of a repairs shipyard situated in the Martin{}ica Cove, east of the city of Rijeka, Croatia. Collected samples were analysed for lead, cadmium, iron, copper, and zinc content. Though annual mean concentrations of suspended particles, lead, and cadmium kept below the guideline values, the metal contents were generally higher than values measured in the city centre. The correlation between the quantity of abrasives used at the shipyard and monthly mean concentrations of all parameters except cadmium suggests that the shipyard was the main source of those pollutants.

Fewer strong sandstorms occurred in the places of origin in 2005, mainly because of the snow cover with moderate high and low pressure systems in the place of dust origin. The weather patterns explain why there were fewer <b>dustfall</b> episodes in Korea in 2005 than in the period between 1997 and 2004. A total of seven <b>dustfall</b> episodes were monitored in Korea in 2005 and they covered a period of 11  days.

To estimate the seasonal and spatial distribution of APAHs in <b>dustfall</b> in Shanghai, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were the analytical methods applied to the <b>dustfall</b> samples collected in this area from Dec. 2004 to Oct. 2005. Forty-one APAHs were found and divided into six groups which were alkyl naphthalenes (ANAs), alkyl phenanthrenes (APHs), alkyl anthracenes (AANs), alkyl fluoranthenes (AFLs), alkyl pyrenes (APYs) and alkyl chrysenes (ACHs). ANAs and APHs were two dominant APAHs {{in the proportion of}} more than 50 %. The concentrations of total APAHs ranged from 1. 6 to 9. 0 μg g- 1. The ratios of APAHs to TPAHs (PAHs plus APAHs) fell into the range of 28 ∼ 50 %. The APAH levels were found to be higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. In terms of spatial distribution, concentration of APAHs was found to be higher in western Shanghai than eastern Shanghai. The source analysis showed that <b>dustfall</b> APAHs mainly derived from vehicle emissions and used crankcase oil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Samples of {{suspended}} matter in surface waters were collected at 1534 stations off {{the west coast}} of Africa during two geophysical cruises of 1972 and 1973. Many positive correlations exist with respect to auxiliary measurements of winds, temperature, salinity, currents, chlorophyll, phytoplankton, zooplankton-nekton, <b>dustfall,</b> and proximity to major river mouths. Some of the relationships can be expressed in terms of oceanic zones. The most concentrated {{suspended matter}} (total, organic, and inorganic) occurs above the continental shelf north of Latitude 7 °N, where the high concentration of organic matter is due to coastal upwelling (indicated by relatively low temperatures and salinities, and high chlorophyll and phytoplankton concentrations). The high concentration f inorganic matter also present along the coasts is due to contributions by major rivers and heavy <b>dustfall.</b> Secondary concentrations of organic matter and the presence of related parameters typify open-ocean belts of divergence at the equator and south of the Sub-Tropical Con-vergence (south of Lat. 35 °S) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} early March 2003 on 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 m 2 straw checkerboard plots on the windward slope and leeward slope of a sand dune on the southeastern edge of Tengger desert, China, to study the mechanism of formation of physical soil crust in desert soils. The samples collected after 1 year were analyzed by sedimentation method, results demonstrated that in the 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 m 2 straw checkerboards, {{the contents of the}} finer particulate matter sorted by wind are 1. 5, 34. 75, and 13. 92 times of that of the blown sand, and the contents of the finer particulate matter on the windward slope are 1. 77, 1. 17 and 1. 34 times of the counterparts on the leeward slope, respectively. The stable concave curved surfaces is most easily formed in the 1. 0 m 2 straw checkerboards among the three sizes of straw checkerboards but not formed in 0. 5 m 2 straw checkerboards. The sorted finer particulate matter, that cannot be buried by extrinsic sand under the protection of the stable concave curved surfaces developed in suitable size of straw checkerboards, provide material base of physical soil crust formation. <b>Dustfall</b> collected in this region was analyzed including its size distribution by sedimentation, chemical elements by X-ray fluorescence and mineral components by X-ray diffraction. The contents of the finer particulate matter of dustflall are more than 412 times of that of the blown sand.

Sigma PAH 16 (sum of 16 PAH compounds) concentrations in the <b>dustfall</b> collected during heating season ranged from 2. 5 to 85. 5 mu g/g, while that during the nonheating season varied from 1. 0 to 48. 2 mu g/g dry weight. The dominant components in the heating season included naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and chrysene, while naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and fluoranthene were dominant during the nonheating season. Compared with the nonheating season, the heating season was characterized by a higher fraction of high-molecular-weight PAHs with four to six rings with exception of the samples from the east industrial area. The east industrial area had more significant correlations between individual PAH compounds, and more discrete triangular components of three-, four-, five- and six-ring PAHs. No significant correlations were observed between the PAHs concentrations and total organic carbon (TOC) in the <b>dustfall</b> samples. The deposition fluxes of Sigma PAH 15 (sum of 15 PAHs except naphthalene), Sigma PAH 6 (sum of 6 carcinogenic PAHs recommended by IARC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) from atmospheric deposition to the whole area were estimated as 1911, 196, and 53 mu g/m(2) /year, respectively. The deposition rates for PAH compounds in the cast industrial area were higher {{than those in the}} urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the deposition contribution of PAHs during domestic heating season in winter was not significant relative to the annual inputs. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The cohort consists of 57 females and 56 males, with an age range of 0. 29 – 3. 9 years. Samples are collected every 6 months from children in residences located at varying distances from major traffic thoroughfares in Sydney. Environmental samples include air, house, and daycare center <b>dustfall,</b> soil, dust sweepings, and gasoline; samples from the children include blood, urine, handwipes prior to and after playing outdoors, and a 6 -day duplicate diet. All samples are analyzed for a suite of 20 elements using inductively coupled plasma methods. Results are presented for the first three 6 -month sampling periods for lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn). For <b>dustfall</b> accumulation, expressed as metal concentration/m 2 / 30 days, {{there was no significant difference}} between homes and daycare centers for either Pb or Mn, no significant change over the three sampling periods (time) for Pb or Mn, and a positive relationship between ‘‘traffic exposure’’ (traffic volume and proximity to the road) and Pb but not Mn. Lead concentrations in soil was a significant predictor for Pb in the house <b>dustfall.</b> For handwipes, the concentrations of Pb and Mn in wipes taken from children after playing outdoors was usually significantly greater than those for wipes taken prior to playing. There was no significant association between the concentrations of either Pb or Mn in handwipes and traffic exposure, and there was no significant association between Pb concentrations in the handwipes and gender, although the latter showed a marginally significant association for Mn (P = 0 : 053). Age was related to Pb level in the handwipes, with older subjects having higher Pb levels, and there were significant decreases in Pb and Mn concentrations over time. <b>Dustfall</b> accumulation was a significant predictor for Pb in the handwipes, and dust sweepings were a significant predictor of Mn in handwipes. Blood lead (PbB) concentrations ranged from 0. 6 to 19 μg/dL (GM 2. 6) (n = 269), and manganese in blood (MnB) ranged from 1. 8 to 45 μg/L (GM 11. 6) (n = 254). There was no significant difference between females and males for either mean PbB or MnB; over time there was a significant decline in PbB but no significant change in MnB. The only significant predictor for PbB was <b>dustfall</b> accumulation, although dietary intake may also be important, and the only significant predictor for MnB was Mn in handwipes prior to playing.

The hotspots in commercial areas are identified by {{spatial distribution}} maps and the fractional value isomers indicates that <b>dustfall</b> in urban Beijing are affected by both current and historical usage of DDTs. It is worth noticing that there is possible application "dicofol-type of DDTs" in Beijing. The measured atmospheric deposition flux is 1. 14 x 10 (5) ng h(- 1) m(- 2) for HCHs and 1. 47 x 10 (5) ng h(- 1) m(- 2) for DDTs, respectively. However, when compared with atmospheric deposition flux, the volatilization flux estimated from concentrations in soils by fugacity model is significantly lower for HCHs (2. 41 ng h(- 1) m(- 2)) and DDTs (0. 07 ng h(- 1) m(- 2)). The net atmospheric flux to the soil suggests that the levels of HCHs and DDTs in soil are dominated by atmospheric deposition and the urban soil in Beijing would be a sink for HCHs and DDTs in the long term.

40|$|Wind-borne dusts are of {{interest}} to geologists for the light they throw on the rate of deposition of loess, and {{on the character of}} minerals supposed to be of aeolian origin. For the solution of these problems it is desirable to know the quantity of dust precipitated per unit area, especially in rain and snow, and the relative quantity. of different sizes. The best plan for making this determination is to measure off a square yard or square meter, and brush up the dust, if dry, or to shovel up all the dust-bearing layer of snow or sleet.

40|$|In April 2001, a major {{atmospheric}} <b>dustfall</b> event {{occurred in}} the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon Territory, Canada. Field samples were collected and analyzed for particle size, mineralogy, chemical composition and Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes. Dusts found above 3000 m had their source in the Gobi desert region of northern China and Inner Mongolia, and were transported to the Yukon following a series of major dust storms {{that took place in}} early April. Dusts found below 3000 m had local (Yukon) or mixed source(s). The Asian dusts had a modal volume diameter of 4 μm typical of far-traveled mineral aerosols. However larger (> 10 μm) particles were also found at 5000 m, suggesting a very rapid trans-Pacific transport in the mid-troposphere. We estimate that the April 2001 event deposited from 5500 to 6335 tons of dust over an area of 21, 000 km 2 in the southwestern Yukon, most of which probably fell within a week. Our findings are consistent with instrumental observations and model simulations of the April 2001 event.

Our findings contribute to clarify the dynamics and the geochemical impact of Asian dust long-range transport events, and to better estimate eolian fluxes of dustborne elements (e. g., Fe) to the Ocean associated with such events.

The composition of these bacterial communities {{may be influenced}} by numerous factors such as number of occupants, pets, season and location. Understanding the house dust microbial community is vital to understanding its' influence on human respiratory health. Aims: The aims of the studies described in this MSc dissertation were to: 1) evaluate the performance of ten commercial nucleic acid extraction kits on dust samples; 2) optimise dust removal from electrostatic <b>dustfall</b> collectors (EDC); 3) determine the bacterial composition of house dust using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and 4) determine those factors influencing the bacterial composition of house dust by performing bioinformatic and data analysis on the sequenced dust samples. Methods: In order to study the microbial content of house dust, an efficient DNA extraction protocol was required. Ten commercial nucleic acid purification protocols were evaluated on their ability to efficiently extract good quality DNA from very low quantities (20 mg) of wet bulk house dust. For the purpose of this study, EDCs were used to collect settled dust from homes of participants in the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS). Electrostatic <b>Dustfall</b> Collectors were placed twice within the same household, approximately 6 months apart, spanning two seasons. The Z/R Fungal/Bacterial DNA MicroprepTM (ZMC) protocol was used to extract DNA from dust removed from EDCs. The V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform to determine the bacterial taxonomic composition of the house dust samples. A custom python wrapper that meshes a set of tools integrated into a computationally efficient workflow, known as the YAP pipeline was used to classify 16 S rRNA sequences into bacterial taxonomies.
