2500|$|On July 15, 2007, {{after the}} source's death, Novak said on Meet the Press that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton {{would never have}} been {{selected}} as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote: [...] "Boy, do <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have let you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president. Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton {{was one of the great}} train wrecks of all time." ...|$|E

60|$|He told me I {{did not do}} myself justice. I {{told him}} I did, and it was because I did and meant to do so to the last, that I would not stoop to propitiate any of them. He was {{concerned}} and even shocked, when I added that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not parade his attachment before them; but <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sacrifice even the honest impulses of his affection to my peace.|$|R
60|$|Meantime {{the wind}} dropped, and Mr. Burns {{began to make}} disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck. I believe it was his devotion for me which made him {{critically}} outspoken on every occasion. All the same, I would not have put up with his humours {{if it had not}} been my lot at one time to nurse him through a desperate illness at sea. After snatching him out of the jaws of death, so to speak, it would have been absurd to throw away such an efficient officer. But sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> dismiss himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must {{thank him}} {{some way or}} other,' said Mary; 'his {{forbearance}} has been beautiful. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have believed me, for I always told him the plain truth. It would have spared him something; but nobody would trust my account of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' went her guttered thoughts. 'I do wish {{grandfather}} {{would say}} something one could understand. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lose that dreadful stare.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] whispered Lord Worthington to his companion, [...] "that fellow {{had better}} be careful. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hold his tongue." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the other}} day that the Eternal had plagiarised from LOST SIR MASSINGBERD: good again, sir! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> plagiarise the death of Zero.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ought and do apologise to Mr.---- the Printer for {{charging}} {{him with}} an omission of the lines which I find was my own--but <b>I</b> also <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not print such a stupid word as finest for fairest." [...] (Revise, November 15, 1813.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miss C., <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> may get it; that's all I say," [...] answers Mr. Ridley. [...] "The poor fellow does no harm, that I acknowledge; but I {{never see}} the good {{he was up to}} yet. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> he'd begin it; <b>I</b> du <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> now." [...] And the honest gentleman relapses into the study of his paper.|$|R
60|$|I felt hurt. What had I {{done that}} Providence should make things so {{unpleasant}} for me? It {{would be a}} little hard, as Ukridge would have said, if, after all my trouble, the professor had discovered some fresh grievance against me. Perhaps Ukridge had been irritating him again. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not identify me so completely with Ukridge. I could not be expected to control the man. Then I reflected that they could hardly have met in the few hours between my parting from the professor at the club-house and my meeting with him on the beach. Ukridge rarely left the farm. When he was not working among the fowls, he was lying on his back in the paddock, resting his massive mind.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{seeing that}} <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{go to the}} deuce with it, he will leave it to a hospital. Is that what you mean?" [...] asked Morris.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep away," [...] {{she said}} with a little stamp of her foot, [...] "for he always brings some bad news or other." ...|$|E
60|$|To me, {{in those}} days, the {{shortcomings}} of the McClintocks did not appear particularly heinous. All our neighbors were living in log houses and frame shanties built beside the brooks, or set close against the hillsides, and William's small unpainted dwelling seemed a natural feature of the landscape, but {{as the years passed}} and other and more enterprising settlers built big barns, and shining white houses, the gray and leaning stables, sagging gates and roofs of my uncle's farm, became a reproach even in my eyes, so that when I visited it for the last time just before our removal to Iowa, I, too, was a little ashamed of it. Its disorder did not diminish my regard for the owner, but <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> clean out the stable and prop up the wagon-shed.|$|R

It has that special quality you hear {{in some of the}} big name stars, although <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> try to hit that high note - or even the low note, especially when the song or background instruments call for it."

6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know, for I saw {{mother was in}} a way. She did talk and whisk about so fast, and made such a fuss, that I thought I must be much worse than I knew. So I told Dr. Medlicott <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> tell me right out if I was going to die, {{in time to see}} you, and then I shouldn't mind. So he said not now, and he thought I should get over it in the end, but that most likely I should have a long time, years perhaps, of being very careful. And when I asked if I should {{be able to go back}} to Eton, he said he hardly {{expected}} it; and that he believed it was kinder to let me know at once than let me be straining and hoping on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whimper. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> No, he just waits--but I'm afraid he'll get lonesome {{some day}} and break loose {{and go back}} to the game." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Lawley. What a pity he didn't go {{into the}} army. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> join the militia. Every man should try to find some useful sphere of employment.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is always}} having parties. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> mind them less, and his {{business}} more. You disbelieved! but I'll see justice done you, Norman, the first thing to-morrow. Well--" ...|$|E
50|$|I {{feel for}} him. Deep down, I always thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be one of}} the guys. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> never have been a wrong choice. He's a great {{competitor}} and a great guy.|$|R
6000|$|Peter's face brightened. [...] "I {{should say}} I did!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "He {{stopped for a}} few days on his way north. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stay here all the time. But he seems to think there is no place like the Great Woods of the North. I could listen all day to his song. Do you know what he always seems to be saying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do so want not to {{make you}} angry, Uncle Tom. And <b>I</b> do so <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be happy with someone else. Nobody ought {{to be made to}} marry unless they like it;--ought they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very sorry}} for it, but I cannot help it,' said Mary; 'no one can be kinder or more forbearing than he has been, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look elsewhere.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So they do, Tom," [...] said Fred, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> put {{a better}} face on things till they do come to pass. His looks {{are enough to}} frighten one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to banish}} {{him from the}} house, Henri; but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not return just at present; but you haven't {{answered}} my question--you haven't told me whether you expect him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{only wish}} is already granted; {{he is my}} servant. That he will serve me {{diligently}} and faithfully I have no doubt. <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> accept or could appreciate a more worthy reward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be civil," [...] {{he said to}} Charlie as {{the door}} closed behind the servant, [...] "to say that <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to {{goodness}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> let my affairs alone and look to his own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, I {{was taken}} by surprise. That is the reason. If I had had a moment to think, I would no more have thought of running that I would think of running from a baby. For, after all, what is Theophile Benoist, that I should seem {{to be afraid of}} him? Pooh! the idea of being afraid of that poor thing! <b>I</b> only <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come along nowI'd show you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No lions!" [...] added Fely, [...] "nothing to see {{but that}} poor old elephant! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have turned round and spouted water at them, as that one {{did to the}} tailor." ...|$|E
60|$|Thomas Ruttledge. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> join something. Joyce {{wants him}} to join the Masonic Lodge. It is not a right life for him to keep hanging about the place and doing nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Warm over Sylvia's sore heart {{rushed the}} tender thought and longing, as her tears began to flow. [...] "He cares for me! he remembered me! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{come back and}} comfort me!" ...|$|E

60|$|My other {{letter was}} from Sir W. P. He {{had seen the}} Harrises. Those foxy {{tortoises}} had advanced a ridiculous £1 19s. 7d. of my September allowance--the price {{of a pair of}} Monnerie bedroom slippers! It was enclosed--and Sir Walter begged me not to worry. Might he be my bank? Would I be so kind as to break it as soon as ever <b>I</b> <b>wished?</b> Meanwhile <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be making further inquires into my affairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] {{she said}} without lifting {{her head from}} my shoulder, [...] "what {{happened}} to the holy Tanofir. I think that I heard him outside the shine giving directions for the digging of Pharaoh's grave at that spot, and saying that he must do so at once as his time was very short. Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go away. Oh! my goodness!" [...] she exclaimed, and suddenly sprang up.|$|R
