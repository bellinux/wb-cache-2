40|$|There {{is not yet}} {{consensus}} on the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data. The main thesis defended is that semantic information encapsulates truth, so that meaningful and well-formed data constitute information only if they also qualify as truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is analysed and then criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on information, and misinformation (i. e. false information) is not a type of information, but pseudo-information, i. e. not information at all. This is shown by arguing {{that none of the}} reasons to interpret misinformation as a type of information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a truth-conditi [...] ...|$|R
