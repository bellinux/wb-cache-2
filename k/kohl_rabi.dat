50|$|The {{principal}} {{reason for}} the large concentrations of Southdown sheep on downland farms over these centuries was {{their role in the}} maintenance of soil fertility. The large flocks grazed the open downs by day and at dusk they came down to the lower arable land for folding. The downland soils are chalky and not naturally fertile, so the close-folding by the sheep on small areas manured and trod the soil. This meant wheat could be grown successfully the following year. With the gradual introduction of new crops such as field turnips, swedes, <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi</b> and other forage crops, the folding system took off, increasing in parallel with expanding human population. The system reached its zenith from about 1845 to 1880.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} cold storage on {{glucosinolate}} concentration was examined in 7 -day-old seed-sprouts of broccoli, <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi,</b> white radish and rocket. Principal glucosinolates identified were glucoraphanin and glucoerucin (in broccoli, <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi</b> and rocket), glucoiberin (in broccoli and <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi),</b> and glucoraphenin and glucodehydroerucin (in white radish). Generally, sprouts {{showed no significant}} changes in individual glucosinolate concentrations during storage at 4 °C for 3 weeks. The exception to this was rocket, which showed a significant decline in glucoerucin and glucoraphanin after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. These preliminary results indicate that {{as there is no}} significant loss of glucosinolates in broccoli, radish and <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi</b> sprouts, these sprouts may be stored under domestic refrigeration conditions without significant loss of potential anti-cancer compounds. Rocket sprouts, on the other hand, should be consumed soon after purchase if glucosinolate levels are to be maintained...|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates, or more {{specifically}} their isothiocyanate breakdown products, {{have been identified}} as having anti-cancer potential via their ability to induce phase 2 detoxification enzymes in humans. In particular, glucoraphanin (which degrades to form sulphoraphane) has received considerable interest owing to its high potency and presence in broccoli, a well known vegetable in Western society. There are however many other vegetables available containing glucosinolates of varying potency. Interestingly, consumption of a vegetable containing a glucosinolate with half the potency of glucoraphanin has similar impact on phase 2 enzyme induction, if twice the amount is consumed. In the case of sprouted-seed, which tend to be higher in glucosinolate concentration than mature vegetables, this does not represent a big difference in the amount ingested, and is good news for a consumer who does not like the taste of broccoli. We analysed the glucosinolate composition of sprouted-seed {{of a wide range of}} 2 ̆ 7 Asian 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Western 2 ̆ 7 vegetables belonging to the Brassica family. Using published phase 2 enzyme induction values for isothiocyanate derivatives, we were able to rate the anti-cancer potential for different sprouts in comparison to Broccoli. Vegetables that performed well included radish, <b>kohl</b> <b>rabi</b> and daikon, and to a lesser extent kale, rocket, Chinese broccoli, cabbage and garden cress...|$|E
