The floods caused many dead coconut trees and disrupted the activities of residents in Sei Undan Village.

Analyze channel calculation using HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 software. Profile analysis is done by dividing into 2 river channels that reach A and B with 3 different reset times, is 5 years, 10 years, and 25 years.

5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat <b>for</b> <b>returning</b> migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering.

5|$|At The Hague 28 April to 1 May 1915, a large {{congress}} of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals. The event {{was called the}} International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. The 180-strong contingent of British women was greatly reduced by Winston Churchill's purposeful cancellation of British ferry service across the Channel, stranding most of the British activists. Already in Antwerp, Macmillan easily attended the women's conference {{to speak for the}} UK—she was one of only three British women present. Macmillan was selected {{as a member of the}} international committee who were to travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method <b>for</b> <b>returning</b> peace to the world, and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with it. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic work {{disability}} generates high {{financial costs}} for society and causes personal suffering {{to patients and}} their families; however, crucial knowledge about the factors associated with long-term sick leave is still missing. This study provides insight, {{from the perspective of}} chronic work disabled patients, into the perpetuating factors for long-term sick leave and promoting factors <b>for</b> <b>return</b> to work. Patients and methodsFive focus group interviews were conducted with 27 patients with different disorders who had been on long-term sickness absence (18 months or more). Qualitative data analysis was performed using a conceptual framework to identify barriers and enablers <b>for</b> <b>return</b> to work. RESULTS: Four main themes of important perpetuating factors for long-term sick leave were identified: health-related obstacles, personal obstacles, social obstacles, and work-related obstacles. Four main themes of important promo-ting factors <b>for</b> <b>return</b> to work were identified: favourable working conditions, positive personal characteristics of the employee, the influence of the social environment, and the influence of the personal economic situation.
