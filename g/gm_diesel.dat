Hook Mountain was sold to a Rhode Island company in 1939, and renamed Block Island. She also operated under the name League Island when requisitioned for World War II service. In 1947, the vessel had her original steam propulsion replaced with a 900 Hp <b>GM</b> <b>diesel</b> from a LST, was renamed Yankee and used to transport vacationers from Providence to Block Island, a task that apparently continued for several decades. The vessel was finally retired from commercial service after the 1983 summer season which included a charter to the America's Cup Races off of Newport, RI. [...] It was then laid up in Montville, CT for several years. [...] It was later towed to Providence, RI and docked very close to where she used to depart from for Block Island service and was neglected and became a target for vandals.|$|E
