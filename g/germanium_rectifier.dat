50|$|The {{carriages}} {{converted to}} form the prototype units were drawn from former LNWR electric units built in 1914 by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon & Finance Company for use on the West London line fourth-rail DC electrification. They had been stored early in World War II after the West London route on which they worked was closed to passengers due to bomb damage. The interiors were modernised with bus-type seating. Driving motor coach 28221 was fitted with a <b>germanium</b> <b>rectifier</b> and displayed at the International Railway Congress, Willesden, London between 26 and 29 May 1954.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{survey of the}} high inverse voltage <b>germanium</b> <b>rectifier</b> or germanium varistor. The history {{of the development of}} this unit during the war and earlier is covered. The theory of conduction and rectification as presently held is described from a qualitative viewpoint. The outstanding properties, both mechanical and electrical, and their dependence on the manufacturing techniques are investigated, These are later linked to the uses to which these units are or may be placed showing how they are affected.

50|$|In 1938 he {{enrolled}} at Brooklyn College where he majored in physics. Benzer {{then moved on}} to Purdue University to earn his Ph.D. in solid state physics. While there he was recruited for a secret military project to develop improved radar. He performed research that {{led to the development of}} stable <b>germanium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and discovered a germanium crystal able to be used at high voltages, among the scientific work that led to the first transistor.|$|R
5000|$|Pfann was {{involved}} in William Shockley's efforts with Bell Labs to use semiconductors to make devices to replace vacuum tubes. The early efforts used germanium. They made high back-voltage <b>germanium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in 1945. Pfann devised {{one of the first}} point-contact transistors: [...] "Specifically, W.G. Pfann had modified the Western Electric 1N26 shielded point-contact (silicon) diode to include two spring-loaded cat whisker point contacts, making a three-electrode configuration with good electrical amplifying properties. This configuration became known at the Type A transistor." [...] He and Walter Brattain developed the process of [...] "forming" [...] these transistors to make them more uniform. Pfann also invented a method of bonding fine gold wires to germanium that made the device functional. [...] "The quiet, unassuming man grew steadily in everyone's esteem as he made one valuable contribution after another to the semiconductor research effort." ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} {{investigation}} of parameters of gamma-transition cascades between compound-states {{and a number of}} low-lying levels of " 1 " 3 " 7 Ba and " 1 " 8 " 1 Hf nuclei. A degree of compatibility between gamma-decay models and the process itself has been under consideration, and factors that are {{to be taken into account}} in further model description of nuclei excited state have been studied. The results were obtained on the basis of method of amplitudes adding of coincident pulses received from two <b>germanium</b> <b>rectifiers</b> with the efficiency of 10 % each. Systematic discrepancy between the predicted by design average parameters of cascade gamma-decay and the obtained experimental data was disclosed. The necessity to develop model description of radiation force functions for cascade transitions has been revealed. The method under usage allows to study experimentally the bulk of the full radiation resonance width which is necessary for the prediction of neutron cross-sections of short-living nuclei. The results of the work may be used in nuclear physics of low energies, astrophysics and reactor engineeringAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to later}} silicon or <b>germanium</b> devices, copper-oxide <b>{{rectifier}}s</b> {{tended to have}} poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely {{more than a few}} volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure - a bridge rectifier for a 12V battery charger would often use 12 metal rectifiers. Selenium rectifiers were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.|$|R
5000|$|A {{selenium}} rectifier {{is about the}} same size as copper oxide rectifiers, but much larger than a silicon or <b>germanium</b> diode. Selenium <b>rectifiers</b> have a long but not indefinite service life of 60,000 to 100,000 hours depending on rating and cooling. The rectifier can show some unforming of the rectifier characteristic after long storage. [...] Each cell can withstand a reverse voltage around 25 volts, and has a forward voltage drop around 1 volt, which limits the efficiency at low voltages. Selenium rectifiers have an operating temperature limit of 130 Â°C, and are not suitable for high-frequency circuits.|$|R
