In late 2001, two {{important}} convictions including possession of ninja rocks were appealed. In People v. Gordon (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1409 (Review denied), Division 1 (San Diego) of the Fourth District Court of Appeal found that possession of ninja rocks was not punishable under section 466 of the penal code. That court applied the <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> <b>rule</b> of construction, deciding that ninja rocks were not enough alike the then-listed burglary tools. On the other hand, in In re Robert B. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 963, Division 3 (Orange County) contradicted this interpretation of section 466 and upheld the conviction. On February 13, 2002, the latter case was granted review by the California Supreme Court.|$|E

40|$|This {{installment}} of Interpretation Matters explores {{one of the}} most widely used canons of statutory construction: the <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> (“of the same kind or class”) principle. “If general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of things, the <b>rule</b> of <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> provides that the general words will be construed as applicable only to things of the same general nature as the enumerated things. ” To take a simple example, a statute prohibited persons placing on the streets “dirt, rubbish, wood, timber, or other material of any kind” tending to obstruct the streets. The statute was held not to apply to an automobile left on the street. “Dirt, rubbish, wood, [and] timber 2 ̆ 2 are of the same kind, class, or nature – a nature different from that of automobiles. Under the canon, the initial particular words of the same class impart a limiting connotation to the later language of an otherwise general nature 2 ̆ 2 other material of any kind. ” The first section below gives example of the operation of the “same kind” precept in state and local tax cases. The second section explores the rationales for the canon. The third section considers arguments by which the party opposing the precept can seek to counter it...|$|R

The respondents took the position that by applying the principle of <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis,</b> it cannot be said that William dropping the ring into the garbage disposal was like or similar to a “fire, storm, or shipwreck.” Therefore, the respondent claimed that this accident did not qualify as “other casualty” under §165. Furthermore, the respondent took the position that the replacement value of the ring, which William subsequently purchased for Nancy, and the salvage value of the original ring, must be offset against the gross loss suffered by Nancy.|$|R

Fidelity to Congress as a principal entails fidelity to its lawmaking enterprise, not to words or sentences divorced from that enterprise. Congress has indicated {{that it does not}} value dictionaries as part of its lawmaking process, and it ascribes at most limited weight to language canons in that process. Further, Justices advocating ordinary meaning analysis too often use dictionary definitions, and language canons such as the rule against surplusage, the whole act <b>rule,</b> and <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis,</b> in ways that are indifferent to Congress’s background understandings when drafting and voting on statutory text.

500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, reversing the Ninth Circuit and holding that the exception {{did not apply}} to this case. The main reason for this finding was the decision that section one's exemption would only be confined to [...] "transportation workers". [...] "The wording of [...] calls for the application of the maxim <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis,</b> the statutory canon that 'where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words...'". Under this method of reading the statute, {{he would be able to}} reach an understanding of what the exemption meant. He wrote, [...] "Under this rule of construction the residual clause should be read to give effect to the terms 'seamen' and 'railroad employees,' and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it; the interpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails to produce these results". Therefore, section one [...] "exempts from the FAA only contracts of employment of transportation workers". Kennedy's decision was joined by four other Justices to create a 5-justice majority.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is presumed}} that a statute will be {{interpreted}} {{so as to}} be internally consistent. A particular section of the statute shall not be divorced {{from the rest of the}} act. The <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> (or eiusdem generis, Latin for [...] "of the same kind") rule applies to resolve the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear. The rule results that where [...] "general words follow enumerations of particular classes or persons or things, the general words shall be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or kind as those enumerated." [...] Thus, in a statute forbidding the concealment on one's person of [...] "pistols, revolvers, derringers, or other dangerous weapons," [...] the term [...] "dangerous weapons" [...] may be construed to comprehend only dangerous weapons of the kind enumerated; i.e., firearms, or perhaps more narrowly still, handguns. A hypothetical court may have to determine whether a sword, a taser, or a Japanese throwing star would be properly included in the [...] "other" [...] category of the statute. Here, the term [...] "other dangerous weapons" [...] must be given a meaning of the [...] "same kind" [...] as the word of established meaning.|$|R
5000|$|Ely's {{most notable}} work was his 1980 book Democracy and Distrust, which ranks {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} works about constitutional law ever written. In it, he argues against [...] "interpretivism" [...] of which Hugo Black was an exponent, [...] "originalism" [...] advanced by Robert Bork, and [...] "textualism" [...] advanced by Antonin Scalia, by contending that [...] "strict construction" [...] fails to do justice to the open texture of many of the Constitution's provisions; at the same time, though, he maintains that the notion that judges may infer broad moral rights and values from the Constitution is radically undemocratic, whether the [...] "moralism" [...] of Ronald Dworkin or the libertarian Richard Epstein. Instead, Ely argued that the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government, by ensuring equal representation in the political process (as in the Court's decision in Baker v. Carr 1961). He argues <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the 9th Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the 14th Amendment) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone's Footnote Four from United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review.|$|R

40|$|The D. C. Circuit’s January 2014 {{decision}} in Verizon v. FCC represented a major milestone {{in the debate}} over network neutrality that has dominated communications policy for the past decade. This article analyzes the implications of the D. C. Circuit’s ruling, beginning with a critique of the court’s ruling that section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the authority to mandate some form of network neutrality. Examination of the statute’s text, application of canons of construction such as <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> and noscitur a sociis, and a perusal of the statute’s legislative history all raise questions about the propriety of the court’s conclusion. Moreover, the precedents on ancillary jurisdiction and common carriage impose limits to the FCC’s section 706 jurisdiction, preventing the FCC from regulating content before or after it is in transit and likely barring the FCC from imposing a strict nondiscrimination mandate. A revised rule based on commercial reasonableness as initially proposed by the FCC could accomplish many of the goals of network neutrality without running afoul of these prohibitions. Reclassification of broadband Internet access to bring it within the regulatory regime governing traditional telephone service (known as Title II) faces substantial statutory obstacles, would not prevent prioritization of services, and ignores the longstanding problems associated with common carriage regulation and forbearance. The legislative history of section 706 also suggests that the FCC has the authority to preempt the concurrent jurisdiction accorded to state regulatory authorities. Moreover, calls to extend network neutrality to interconnection between networks overlooks the fact that such arrangements are not universal and instead are based on some type of reciprocity and that requiring zero-price interconnection would ignore the important role played by prices and by bilateral negotiations. The article closes by examining five early examples of network neutrality disputes: MetroPCS/YouTube, AT 2 ̆ 6 T/Apple FaceTime, Verizon/Google tethering apps, Verizon/Google Wallet, and the Amazon Kindle/zero-rating programs. These cases demonstrate the difficulties surrounding the implementation of network neutrality rules...|$|R

40|$|According to {{conventional}} wisdom, {{the state of}} statutory interpretation is not strong. Its canons of construction-noscitur a sociis, <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis,</b> expressio unius est exclusio alterius, reddendo singula singulis, {{and more than a}} few others-are a morass of Latin into which many law students and even judges have sunk. Its practitioners are unprincipled. Its doctrines are muddied. Its victims are many. In short, the system is broken-unless, of course, it is not. In The Language of Statutes: Laws and Their Interpretation, Lawrence M. Solan slices through the rhetoric, the fighting, and the law-review-article histrionics in an attempt to show that the system actually works pretty well. Solan admits that there are hard cases (p. 4). He even outlines how and when those hard cases are likely to arise, drawing on his expertise in cognition and linguistics (p. 4). But he argues that those hard cases are the exceptions (p. 4); to him, the easy cases are the rule (pp. 4 - 5). Part of the problem, Solan writes, is that hardly anyone ever talks about those easy cases. Instead, commentators focus only on the difficult interpretive choices that reach the Supreme Court. Solan claims that this vantage point obscures the reality of the situation, which is that there is usually no dispute as to how a law will apply. Those are the easy cases. When the text of a statute reads 2 ̆ 2 No vehicles allowed in the park 2 ̆ 2 and the defendant has driven his pickup truck onto the Great Lawn, the rule clearly and neatly applies. The parties recognize that the statute applies. The case settles or the defendant pleads, and everyone goes home. No one writes law review articles about these cases. Partly because the vast majority of cases are such car-in-the-park cases, Solan concludes that statutory interpretation actually works fairly well. The system, he claims, is not 2 ̆ 2 a mess, full of arbitrary decisions, 2 ̆ 2 as many think (p. 4). We should not be 2 ̆ 2 terribly worried 2 ̆ 2 either that judges sometimes have to make decisions or that judges have too little power to make such decisions when necessary (p. 4). The proper application of a statute to a particular set of facts is clear 2 ̆ 2 most of the time, 2 ̆ 2 and people understand their obligations under the law 2 ̆ 2 well enough 2 ̆ 2 (p. 4).

In contrast to the usual findings {{of the literature on}} the incentive effects of intellectual property rights, we find that, although in most cases the incentives to update a database are insufficient from society's point of view, the possibility of extending the term of protection by making 'substantial changes' in the database may create an incentive for excessive updating.

Fourth Amendment scholars have repeatedly attacked the rule {{on the ground that}} it is unpersuasive on its face and gives the government too much power This Article responds that critics have overlooked the benefits of the rule and have overstated its weaknesses. The third-party doctrine serves two critical functions. First, the doctrine ensures the technological neutrality of the Fourth Amendment. It corrects for the substitution effect of third parties that would otherwise allow savvy criminals to substitute a hidden third-party exchange for a previously public act. Second, the doctrine helps ensure the clarity of Fourth Amendment rules. It matches the Fourth Amendment rules for information to the rules for location, creating clarity without the need for a complex framework of sui <b>generis</b> <b>rules.</b> Finally, the two primary criticisms of the third-party doctrine are significantly weaker than critics have claimed. The third-party doctrine is awkward for reasons of form rather than function; it is a consent rule disguised as an application of Katz 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 reasonable expectation of privacy 2 ̆ 2 test.

2500|$|Justice Souter {{believed}} that {{the time had come}} to revisit the essential premise underpinning both the Court's opinion in United States v. Place and the majority's opinion in Caballes—that the sniff of a dog is infallible, and can reveal either the presence or absence of narcotics and nothing else. [...] "The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.... Their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine." [...] Souter pointed to a study relied on by the State of Illinois in its reply brief, indicating that [...] "dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search." [...] If a dog is not infallible, then there is no logical basis for the sui <b>generis</b> <b>rule</b> underlying Place and Caballes, and every reason to investigate [...] "the actual function that dog sniffs perform." [...] Because the dogs are in the hands of government agents determined to discover evidence of crime, the dog sniff is the [...] "first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband," [...] and hence is a [...] "search" [...] within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In the context of a traffic stop, an additional search unrelated to the initial purpose of the stop requires reasonable suspicion.

40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Section 81 (1) (d) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 {{allows a}} company, {{one or more}} of its {{directors}} or shareholders to apply to a court of law to wind up a solvent company. In essence, they can do so under three specified circumstances namely, where the directors are deadlocked in the management of the company and the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, the shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual general meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired, or it is otherwise just and equitable for a company to be wound up. Item 9 schedule 5 (1) of the Companies Act 2008 states that chapter 14 of the Companies Act 1973 continues to apply in regard to winding-up and liquidation of companies under the Companies Act 2008 as if the Companies Act 61 of 1973 has not been repealed. By virtue of this schedule, section 347 of the Companies Act 1973 still remains applicable. However, section 347 (1) of the Companies Act 1973 still makes reference to section 346 of the Companies Act 1973 which is no longer applicable for winding-up of a solvent company and for that very reason it appears as though the intention is that section 347 (1) of the Companies Act 1973 should not apply in such circumstances, I recommended that an amendment be made to the Companies Act 2008 to rectify this discrepancy. In light of the inclusion of section 347 (2) of the Companies Act 1973, by virtue of item 9 schedule 5 of the Companies Act 2008, an application brought by shareholders places a definitive onus and an additional burden on the applicants to prove that they have exhausted all remedies available to them and they had no other alternative but to bring a winding-up application as a last resort. The all encompassing provision of section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act 2008, I argued, should allow for a winding-up of a company, even in respect of the weaker forms of deadlock, where it does not fit neatly within section 81 (1) (d) (i) and section 81 (1) (d) (ii) of the Companies Act 2008. The word ‘otherwise’, in my opinion, has been correctly included in section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act 2008. The courts will inevitably be 8 | P a g e left to determine the perimeters of section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act in relation to the sections 81 (1) (d) (i) and 81 (1) (d) (ii) of the Companies Act 2008. I discovered striking similarities to the wording of the just and equitable provision and this wording has been consistent in various versions of the companies acts (both current and previous) in various jurisdictions. The <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> principle, I argued, is not applicable and the just and equitable provision needs to be looked at independently of the other grounds. From the recent case law arising on the interpretation of section 81 (1) (d) of the Companies Act 2008, {{it is clear that the}} various principles which were developed during the era of the previous companies acts were still applicable and relevant to the Companies Act 2008, unless the Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa decides otherwise...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the issues}} raised is whether the making of {{recommendations}} by the Pricing Committee is reviewable under PAJA. for the first respondent submitted that {{the recommendation of the}} pricing committee is not reviewable because it is neither an [...] "administrative action" [...] nor a [...] "decision" [...] as defined in PAJA. He argued that the [...] "recommendation" [...] of the Pricing Committee is purely advisory in nature, and therefore does not fall within the definition of a decision as contained in Section 1(v) of PAJA. I agree with for the first respondent that the recommendation of the Pricing Committee is not covered by those [...] "decisions" [...] listed in Section 1(v)(a)-(f) of PAJA. Section 1(v)(g) is more problematical. Its wording is much wider and it is a typical [...] "catch all" [...] provision. for the first respondent however argued that the words [...] "any other act ... of an administrative nature" [...] should be interpreted restrictively and with reference to the kinds of decisions listed in paragraphs 1(v)(a)-(f). For this submission he relied on the <b>ejusdem</b> <b>generis</b> principle, as there is a distinct genus of decisions listed under this definition. I cannot agree. Firstly the wording of this sub-section makes it plain that the actions listed in Section 1(v)(a)-(g) are not exhaustive. This was conceded by for the first respondent. Secondly, {{there is nothing in the}} wording of Section 1(v)(g) which indicates that the words [...] "any other act or thing of an administrative nature" [...] refers to only acts or things belonging to a certain [...] "genus". PAJA was specifically enacted to give effect to the constitutional right of citizens to just administrative action. This relates to all forms of administrative action and not just a restrictive [...] "genus" [...] of acts of an administrative nature. (See Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of SA: Ex parte President of the Republic of South Africa, 2000(2) SA 674 CC; JR de Ville: Judicial Review of Administrative Action in South Africa at p. 39.)The Pricing Committee was appointed to make recommendations. As I will show later it is not in dispute that these recommendations are a jurisdictional prerequisite for the making of recommendations. It is in my view clear that the recommendations could adversely affect not only the rights of members of the pharmaceutical industry but also the rights of consumers, and therefore the public at large. When the Committee considered the public comment in formulating their recommendations they were clearly performing a function which was of an administrative nature. I am therefore satisfied that the word [...] "decision" [...] does not have the narrow meaning contended for by the Respondents. The next point to consider is whether the recommendations of the Pricing Committee would have a [...] "direct external legal effect". From the wording of Section 22G(2), it is clear that the making of a recommendation by the Committee is a specific and separate requirement for the making of the regulations, because it is only upon the recommendation of the Pricing Committee that the Minister can make the Regulations. That being so, and for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, it follows that the recommendations must ultimately have a direct external legal effect. These recommendations are not mere preliminary determinations, investigative actions or intermediate steps, which the legislature intended to exclude from the definition of administrative action. (See Currie & Klaaren: Promotion of Administrative Justice Act Benchbook at 44-45) On the contrary the recommendations are upon promulgation transformed into the regulations .... I am ... satisfied that a valid recommendation by the Pricing Committee is a jurisdictional requirement for valid regulations. Valid recommendations entail at least 3 elements:(a) A recommendation made by the Pricing Committee, and not by any other person or entity;(b) A fair procedure must be adopted and sustained by the Pricing Committee in its meetings;(c) A proper application of the mind by a duly constituted Pricing Committee to all representations made to it.These are in my view all matters which fall squarely within the definition contained in Section 1(v)(g) namely [...] "any other act of an administrative nature".|$|R
