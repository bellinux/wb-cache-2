5|$|M-331 is an {{unsigned}} state trunkline {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan {{located within the}} city of Kalamazoo. It runs from the southern city limits north into downtown Kalamazoo. This {{was one of many}} highways to be established or realigned {{as a result of a}} rationalization process initiated in 1998 during the tenure of Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b> M-331 uses streets in Kalamazoo that were once part of US Highway 131 (US131) before a freeway was built that bypassed the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b> This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the freeway}} was {{extended}} eastward {{a few blocks}} through a junction with the newly opened Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to its present-day eastern terminus near Conant Street. The state requested additional Interstate Highway System mileage that year as well, and in the proposals submitted was a request to extend the Davison to I-96 and I-94. These plans to transfer the freeway to state control and extend it were dropped in the 1970s after opposition to another freeway in Detroit. The plans would have extended it west to the Jeffries and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53). Upon its transfer to state control in 1993, it had previously been a county-maintained freeway, the Davison Freeway was designated as M-8. Three years later, the Davison was closed {{for a year and}} a half to reconstruct it to Interstate Highway standards with an additional through travel lane and a wider left shoulder for improved safety and traffic handling as well as a new interchange with Woodward Avenue. The reconstructed freeway was reopened on October 8, 1997 by Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b>|$|E

25|$|In July 2000, {{shortly before}} the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush {{campaign}} sources said Elizabeth Dole was {{on the short list}} to be named the vice-presidential nominee, along with Michigan Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler,</b> New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former Missouri Senator John Danforth. Many pundits believed that Dole was the frontrunner for the vice presidential nomination. Bush then surprised most pundits by selecting former U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who was actually in charge of leading Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000, Pataki's name {{surfaced}} on {{the short}} list to be the running mate for Republican presidential nominee George W.

Bush eventually selected the man {{who was in charge of}} scouting vice presidential candidates, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Pataki had strongly campaigned for Bush including an unsuccessful effort to keep John McCain off the New York primary ballot (which Bush ultimately won).|$|E
25|$|In the 2002 election, {{incumbent}} Republican Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> was term-limited and {{not able}} to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's Lieutenant Governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for re-election by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic Whip to run for Governor, his House seat having been completely redrawn in redistricting {{to make it all}} but unwinnable for him.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{completion}} of I-69 near Marshall in late 1967, US 27 followed 17 Mile Road and Kalamazoo Avenue into Marshall. That routing was turned back to local control after {{the completion}} of I-69 to I-94.M-227 came into existence nearly 35 years after {{the completion of}} I-69 in southern Michigan and, except for the section of old US 27, was long a collection of unnumbered local surface roads.

25|$|After a close race, with polls {{showing the}} two {{candidates}} neck-and-neck, Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%). After Granholm was elected Governor in 2002, arguments broke about between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force {{him out of the}} 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler contested that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Granholm ran for Attorney General of Michigan in 1998 {{to succeed}} thirty-seven year Democratic {{incumbent}} Frank J. Kelley. She defeated Republican John Smietanka, the 1994 nominee and former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, by 52% to 48% and served from 1999 to 2003. She ran for Governor in 2002 to succeed Republican <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b> She defeated Engler's Lieutenant Governor Dick Posthumus by 51% to 47% and became Michigan's first female governor on January 1, 2003. She was re-elected {{to a second}} term in 2006 against Republican businessman Dick DeVos by a large margin and served until January 1, 2011, when she was term-limited. As Governor, Granholm received praise for her focus on renewable energy and in leading the state's automotive industry through the crisis of 2008–10.|$|E
500|$|Following her death, {{many state}} {{political}} figures {{paid tribute to}} her, including Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> and his wife Michelle, who called her [...] "Michigan's rose", and Lieutenant Governor Connie Binsfeld, who characterized her as a [...] "beloved role model for our state".|$|E
500|$|M-311 {{was created}} on October 1, 1998 {{as a part}} of Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler's</b> Rationalization process. The {{original}} routing started at BL I-94/Michigan Avenue and Raymond Avenue. It followed Raymond Avenue to Emmet Street before turning east to Cooper Avenue. From Cooper Avenue, M-311 turned east again on N Drive North until meeting 11 Mile Road. There it followed 11 Mile Road south to M-60 in Burlington. Since the original transfer, all of M-311 north of I-94 was returned to Calhoun County control. This eliminated the section that made a [...] "U-turn". Since December 2009, the highway has been signed in the field.|$|R
25|$|On January 7, 2011, Snyder {{announced}} he was appointing Michigan Supreme Court Justice Maura D.

500|$|M-294 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} Calhoun County in the US state of Michigan. It {{is one of a}} handful of highways that was established or realigned as a result of a rationalization process initiated in 1998 during the tenure of Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b> M-294 is approximately [...] east of Interstate 194 (I-194) and connects M-96 with I-94 southeast of Battle Creek.|$|E
500|$|M-227 is a [...] north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan. It consists largely of {{a segment of}} old U.S. Highway 27 (US27) along {{the south and west}} sides of Marshall. The highway passes the airport and serves an industrial section of town north of the Kalamazoo River. M-227 was created {{as a part of a}} program to add additional routes into the state's highway system under the leadership of Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b>|$|E

5000|$|As part of Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler's</b> [...] "Build Michigan II" [...] plan in {{the late}} 1990s, about 9200 mi of roadway were {{investigated}} as potential candidates for state maintenance {{as part of the}} Rationalization plan. Included in these queries were county roads 553, 460 and 462; the latter two roadways connected east-west across the former base. Traffic to and from the base was increasing as a byproduct of economic redevelopment at K.I. Sawyer, and if the state took control of the roadways, they would be marked on the state map like other state trunklines, further benefiting redevelopment. Local officials were concerned at the time because at least one proposal included a total of 103 mi of roads, one-third of the county's primary county road network. The MCRC manager was concerned that such a transfer could impact the level of funding the commission received for the maintenance of the roads that would remain under county jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988 {{the group}} also started a {{homeless}} shelter and [...] "drop in center" [...] for the homeless as well. In 1991 a tent city was created in a nearby vacant lot to oppose the governor's cuts in social services. Rev. Rowe and Cass Church received notoriety throughout Michigan when they protested Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler's</b> proposed budget reductions for General Assistance. They used the lawn of the Marie, the vacant apartment building next to the church building, {{to put up a}} [...] "tent city". Hundreds or people gathered at the site - homeless, members of the Union for the Homeless, members of Welfare Rights, Cass church members and supporters from the larger denomination and other churches. They kept a vigil, day and night, for a month as a prophetic reminder that the slated cuts would dramatically increase the number of homeless people in the state. Rowe's involvement in the protests {{was one of the reasons}} the Detroit News named him a 1991 Michiganian of the Year.|$|R

Her {{contention}} was that the court had been overtaken in its thought by appointees of former Governor <b>John</b> M. <b>Engler.</b> During her tenure other members of what she called the Engler Four roundly attacked her, even to the point of trying to silence her public comment with a gag order, Administrative Order 2006-08. During her time at the high court she remained steadfast that the people of Michigan had a right to know what was going on at the court as long as the matter at hand was not pending or impending an outlined in Canon 3A (6) of the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct Even after she left the court she was a staunch critic of behavior of the other justices. In revealing racist comments made but Robert Preston Young, Jr., at the time of his re-election in 2010, the court made an ill-fated attempt to censure her. The sent her a letter telling her that she was censured without apparently remembering that the Michigan Supreme Court can censure ONLY on the recommendation of the state Judicial Tenure Commission (per the State Constitution of Michigan of 1963, Article VI, Section 30), something that had not happened. In publishing her book in 2013, Weaver noted that it was the last remaining obligation she had to the citizens of Michigan.|$|R
500|$|The current {{alignment}} of M-331 {{was part of}} the long-time {{alignment of}} US131 before that highway was relocated onto a freeway west of Kalamazoo in the 1960s. The trunkline was designated on October 1, 1998 as part of a rationalization process started by Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> designed to transfer control of roads and streets in Michigan of economic importance to the state. The highway is not shown on the official state map published by the Michigan Department of Transportation, but it is labeled on the truck operator's map as an [...] "unsigned state highway".|$|E
500|$|After {{many years}} of inactivity, further work began along this same route to relieve traffic {{congestion}} in the area, but the resulting highway was designated {{as a part of}} M-5 rather than I-275 or M-275. The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994. This extended a freeway from I-275's previous terminus at I-96/I-696 north to 12Mile Road. A plan enacted by then Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M-5 (Haggerty Connector) project. In 1999, a second extension of M-5 was completed to 14Mile Road, but only as an expressway. The final [...] between 14Mile Road and Pontiac Trail opened to traffic on November 1, 2002.|$|E
500|$|MDOT hired a new consultant, Schimpeler/Coradino Associates, in 1984 {{to study}} the {{proposed}} freeway. The consultant recommended the freeway in March 1985. The South Beltline {{was included in the}} ten-year highway plan in 1986. By 1989, the state wanted to set the route in 1991 with construction starting in 1993. The freeway was studied as a possible toll road in June 1991 after three alternative routes were proposed the previous year. That September, the final route was set with a projected start date in 1997. The toll road concept was revived in September 1995 to offset the failure of a proposed gas tax increase. As a cost-saving measure, the number of interchanges was reduced to four from eight in June 1996. When a gas tax increase was passed in 1997, Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> promised at least seven access points for the freeway. The South Beltline was touted as [...] " [...] travel time around Grand Rapids virtually in half".|$|E
500|$|After {{many years}} of inactivity, further work began along this same route, but the {{resulting}} highway was designated as a northern extension to M-5 rather than I-275 or M-275. The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994. This extended the route from M-5's previous terminus at M-102 (8Mile Road) over the latter highway's alignment west and north to 12Mile Road. A plan enacted by then Governor <b>John</b> <b>Engler</b> in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M-5 Haggerty Connector project.

[...] McCain did have the support {{of the rest of the}} Republican Arizona congressional delegation. [...] Hull would continue to attack McCain during the campaign, and was featured in high-profile Arizona Republic and New York Times stories about McCain's reputation for having a bad temper, with the latter featuring on-the-record criticism from Governor of Michigan <b>John</b> <b>Engler.</b> [...] By early November, stories about McCain's temper problem were frequent enough that Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz wrote a survey article about them. [...] Some of McCain's opponents, including those in or close to the Senate Republican leadership, intimated that McCain's temper was a sign of mental instability. [...] The notion that this was due to McCain's POW days caused Admiral James Stockdale, a fellow former POW and 1992 vice-presidential candidate for Ross Perot, to write an op-ed piece for The New York Times, [...] "John McCain in the Crucible". In it, Stockdale said that the reverse was true: that the experience of resisting during the POW experience made former POWs more emotionally stable in later life, not less. [...] In early December, McCain released some 1,500pages of his medical and psychiatric records, which showed several psychiatric evaluations over a number of years following his POW release that indicated no signs of lingering mental or emotional difficulty from that period.|$|E
