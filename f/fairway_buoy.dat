The Marine Department's VHF radio network {{provides}} comprehensive marine communication coverage throughout the harbour and its approaches. The department has direct communication links with other maritime authorities and users worldwide. Locally, the department's Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) maintains direct contact with emergency response services, which include the Government Flying Service, Marine Police and Fire Services. MRCC provides 24-hour maritime distress alert monitoring and co-ordinates all maritime search and rescue operations within the Hong Kong search and rescue region in the South China Sea.|$|R
5000|$|The {{western side}} of Braye Bay has been {{extended}} towards the east with a pier, which has created this sheltered artificial harbour. The best time to enter the harbour is during rising tide, as it dries when at low water neaps. In 1859, when the artificial harbour was built, lighting facilities to guide the ships through the entry channel or [...] "fairway channel" [...] were also fixed, as directed by the Hydrographic Office. Lights were fixed at two levels. Two red leading lights were installed {{at the head of}} the harbour; one was fixed on a parapet wall at a height of 25 ft above high water tide level and the other, an upper light, was placed on the north-east corner, placed at 55 ft height above the maximum tide condition, about 370 yard m from the lower light location. Navigation guidelines were also prescribed for entry into the harbour, guided by the two lights. At present, there are five harbour <b>Fairway</b> <b>buoys.</b> These are QG and QR at its outer end, and Q(2)G 5sec towards the centre, and QG (3) 5sec and QR (3) 5sec on approach to Little Crabby Harbour. 2FR (vert) lights mark the Commercial Quay end. FG and FR lights mark entrance to Little Crabby Harbour.|$|R

50|$|Although ships {{delivered}} freight {{and passengers}} to Cairns from October 1876 {{and the town}} was surveyed the same year, the harbour was not surveyed for shipping until 1878.

5000|$|A Safe Water Mark, {{as defined}} by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in {{maritime}} pilotage to indicate the end of a channel. It usually implies that open, deep and safe water lies ahead, though it is sometimes also used to indicate the start and end of a buoyed section of a continuous narrow channel, or a line of these marks can be used to mark a safe route through shallow areas. [...] It is therefore important to consult an appropriate chart to determine the exact meaning in each case. The marker is also sometimes known as a <b>Fairway</b> <b>Buoy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|We {{have been}} kindly {{furnished}} by the Harbour Master, Captain Rundle, {{with the following}} particulars of {{the wreck of the}} schooner Pioneer. The Pioneer, schooner, 87 tons, Thomas Richie, master, bound from Maryborough to Rockhampton, left the <b>Fairway</b> <b>Buoy,</b> Harveyâ€™s Bay, at 10 a.m. on Saturday last, the 10th instant she passed the Sloping Hummock at 3 p.m., bearing south-west, and distant 8 mi; the vessel steered N.W. until opposite Bustard Head, and then altered her course half a point westward, the wind, at the time, blowing hard from S.S.E., and a heavy sea, running. About 4 a.m. on Sunday [...] "breakers ahead" [...] were reported, and the vessel WHS immediately hauled to the -west- ward. Before she could be brought to fore reach she struck upon a reef running out from Mast Head Island, bearing cast 24 mi from Cape Capricorn. The sea washed clean over her, and she showed Signs of breaking up the long-boat was launched. The master and crew laid-to off the wreck -until daylight. They managed to get on board again at 1 p.m., and found the vessel full of water, with her decks and most of her broadside started. After several attempts, they found that they could do nothing towards saving the vessel, and all hands sailed for Keppel Bay, where they arrived on Thursday morning.|$|E
5000|$|John Simpson was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} lightkeeper of Woody Island and the lighthouses became operational on 1 October 1867. The two lights were considered as one unit, twin lights that lined up with each other. In the Government Gazette in 1867, Portmaster, GP Heath described how the lights operated together in order to guide vessels through Hervey Bay:When entering Hervey's Bay, steer so as to pass one or two miles of the <b>Fairway</b> <b>Buoy,</b> until the two lights on Woody Island are visible, and a brought into line. Steer with the lights in one ...until the two lights are almost {{on the same level}} ... keep a look-out for the red buoy ... On sighting the buoy, steer ... given ... for the red buoy off the Woody Island Spit ... When the lights are seen to become red at the same time, a vessel is about one-third of distance from the spit across the channel ... From thence, steer to pass ... as usual ... until the high light Bluff light is obscured ... Steer SSW until the light again opens out as a bright light ... from which a course must be ... shaped for the river heads..Initially, a keeper's house was built at North Bluff. The main light was positioned south at Middle Bluff, however, keeper's quarters were not constructed at Middle Bluff until 1868. Both lights had signal masts and a storage shed was built on the beach at Middle Bluff, on {{the eastern side of the}} island, to store kerosene for the lighthouse along with other provisions.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1878 Connor {{travelled}} from Brisbane to Cairns on the SS Victoria, arriving {{the evening}} of 31 January. He commenced {{work the next day}} (what vessel he used is not detailed), completing the survey of Cairns Harbour in fine weather by 9 February. He then travelled to survey Port Douglas on the SS Dugong, and returned to Brisbane on the SS Elamang on 22 February. He reported to the Colonial Treasurer, in a letter dated 24 March 1878, that Cairns Harbour, at the extreme south end of Trinity Bay, had an anchorage sheltered from [...] "east by south to west". Three channels existed from the anchorage into the port, the east channel being the most direct, and at least 6 inches deeper than the other two. He noted that the [...] "shoalest" [...] water of 7 feet 6 inches (2.29m) at low water springs was found from one to two miles inside the <b>Fairway</b> <b>buoy.</b> The water then deepened gradually until there was over 30 feet (9.14m) just off the wharves (on {{the west side of the}} mouth of Trinity Inlet). He added that he had left well defined datum marks at both Cairns and Port Douglas. His report included a map of Cairns Harbour, scaled at 4 inches to the nautical mile, which indicated soundings in feet, reduced to low water ordinary spring tides. The datum mark at Bessie Point was indicated on the map as being [...] "12 feet above low water ordinary Sptides", and near the map's title it was stated that the datum mark was [...] "on top of the largest boulder on Bessie Point".|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{correlate}} the abundance of eggs and larvae of flat fishes belonging to families Cynoglossidae and Soleidae with the hydrographical parameters of the environment, particularly the salinity. The eggs and larvae were found to occur in the Cochin backwater during the pre-monsoon period but not during the south west monsoon period. During the south west monsoon period larvae belonging to very early stages were found at the marine end (<b>Fairway</b> <b>Buoy).</b> The continued or prolonged existence of very low salinity appears to restrict the distribution of flat fish larvae. In the post-monsoon period also the eggs and larvae were not found in regions of very low salinity. Larvae of Cynoglossus puncticeps (Richardson), C. brevis Gunther, C. cynoglossus (Ham. Buch), C. lida (Bleeker) and Solea heinii Steindachner were obtained in the collection taken from the estuary. From the data it is seen that each species has specific spawning period...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{seasonal}} and spatial variation of phytoplankton, based on the observations at four stations (Aroor to <b>Fairway</b> <b>Buoy)</b> in the Cochin backwater during 1972 - 73. Two peaks of phytoplankton abundance are usually observed, with the diatoms playing the major {{role in determining the}} pattern of seasonal variations. An analysis of variance indicates that the spatial variation is as high as the seasonal variation. The usefulness of chlorophyll a in relation to the phytoplankton counts as a measure of the phytoplankton abundance has been studied by using the correlation coefficients; it has been found from an analysis of covariance that a common relationship exists between phytoplankton and chlorophyll a for the estuary. The fluctuations in some of the environmental characteristics have been discussed with their relative influence on thei production of phytoplankton. In the light of the results obtained, outlines of modifications in the sampling procedure have been given to the study of phytoplankton production in the estuary more comprehensive...|$|E
