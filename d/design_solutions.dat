In addition to teaching practical <b>design</b> <b>solutions,</b> the apprentices had hands-on work with various building trades. Farm work and hay making contributed a physical aspect.

5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality <b>design</b> <b>solutions</b> that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{chimneys}}, {{also called}} heat chimneys or heat stacks, {{can also be}} used in architectural settings to decrease the energy used by mechanical systems (systems that heat and cool the building through mechanical means). Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation have been for decades the standard method of environmental control in many building types, especially offices, in developed countries. Pollution and reallocating energy supplies have led to a new environmental approach in building design. Innovative technologies along with bioclimatic principles and traditional design strategies are often combined to create new and potentially successful <b>design</b> <b>solutions.</b> The solar chimney is one of these concepts currently explored by scientists as well as designers, mostly through research and experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Postmodernism is a {{rejection}} of 'totality', {{of the notion that}} planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is {{a rejection}} of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and prefabricated <b>design</b> <b>solutions</b> (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in social reform, which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which capitalism could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).|$|E

He is the creative content manager and the master puppeteer at Bidaya Media Company, the producers of Iftah Ya Simsim, and is the muppet performer of Ka’aki (Cookie Monster) and Gargour (Grover). He also voices a variety of muppet characters that includes Badr (Bert), Addad (Count Von Count) and {{one half of the}} Two Headed Monster. Ammar is the founder of 31 Workshop, and is also a designer, creative consultant and lecturer. Previously, Ammar specialized in <b>design</b> <b>solutions</b> both locally and internationally since 2001 across urban, architecture and graphic design. Because of his childhood passion for the world of puppetry, Ammar has worked on designing, building and operating multiple puppet characters, which are used today through 31 Workshop in the production of live performances and media segments. He was also mentored by Muppet performer Marty Robinson and trained under several professional muppet performers like Matt Vogel, Peter Linz and Michael Earl.|$|E

500|$|Before World War II, {{a number}} of {{cooperative}} investment projects known as [...] "egne hjem" [...] (roughly [...] "our own homes") resulted {{in a handful of}} developments, but after the war these gave way to cooperative organizations that were formed to finance and build large-scale residential complexes. The largest-- Oslo Bolig og Sparelag, known as OBOS—built its first complex Etterstad in Oslo, but there were similar initiatives throughout the country. These co-ops set standards for housing, hired architects to <b>design</b> <b>solutions,</b> and contracted to have them built. Entire sections, known as drabantbyer - or [...] "satellite cities" [...] - were built in the outskirts of major cities. The first of these - Lambertseter - introduced an entirely new phenomenon in the eastern areas of Oslo such as in Groruddalen, but similar areas also emerged in Bergen, Trondheim, and other cities. The apex of this trend was reached in 1966 with the massive buildings in Ammerudlia.|$|E
