5|$|Now back in Austria, Metternich {{witnessed}} {{first hand}} the Austrian army's defeat at the Battle of Wagram.

During peace talks at Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked {{his position on the}} future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, as <b>Foreign</b> <b>Minister</b> (and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household). In early 1810 Metternich's earlier affair with Junot became public but, because of Eleonore's understanding, the scandal was minimal.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{describe}} and compare how female and male <b>foreign</b> <b>ministers</b> are represented in Swedish and U. S. daily press. Choosing two critical cases, Swedish and U.

Based upon the ontology of social constructivism and theories of gendered media representation, a qualitative analysis will be conducted to be able {{to describe}} how media representations of these <b>foreign</b> <b>ministers</b> look like. The use of gender stereotypical words and meanings used when portraying <b>foreign</b> <b>ministers</b> in media will be compared both between the female and male <b>foreign</b> <b>ministers</b> and between the Swedish and U. S. daily press. The analysis will show that the <b>foreign</b> <b>ministers</b> are portrayed differently based on sex, where women are portrayed as weak and emotional, with their competence doubted, while the men are strong and unquestionable competent...|$|R
