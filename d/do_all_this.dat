500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} human being), is {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses wonder about the nature of man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do you <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E

It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it was nice to be able to play the character and not have to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> physical stuff".|$|E

"She (May Stebbins) {{wrote down}} the numbers as the {{observer}} called them, but after some nights of recording a hundred readings just to get one magnitude, {{she said it was}} pretty slow business.

Thereafter she would often prod me with the question, [...] "When are you going to change to electricity?" [...] It happened that within two or three months, the Department of Physics gave an open house, and one of the exhibits was in (the) charge of a young instructor, F.C. Brown. He showed how, when he turned on a lamp to illuminate a selenium cell, a bell would ring, when the lamp was off, the bell would stop. Here was the idea: Why not turn on a star to a cell on a telescope and measure a current?" ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{director}} Ruth Lambert held {{a series}} of casting auditions for the film in New York, Los Angeles, and London, but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters. The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind, and Pierce was given a copy of the Treasure Planet script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the film's scenic elements while he was working on Pixar's A Bug's Life (1998). He stated that [...] "the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling" [...] that he accepted the role. Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. [...] "We offered it to her and she was really excited," [...] Clements said. Musker said, [...] "This is the first action adventure character that Emma has ever played and she was pregnant during several of the sessions. She was happy that she could <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> action and not have to train for the part" [...] There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins; Brian Murray (John Silver) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins) were signed after months of auditions. Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because [...] "it's a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves," [...] and that [...] "to be part of that tradition is unbelievable to me". Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt [...] "combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness" [...] and that they liked his approach.|$|E

2500|$|Bowie was insistent {{that there}} would be no live {{performances}} in support of the album, with Visconti telling the NME, [...] "He's fairly adamant he's never gonna perform live again... One of the guys would say, 'Boy, how are we gonna <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> live?' and David said, 'We're not'. He made a point of saying that all the time." [...] However, Visconti later clarified that he did not say Bowie would never perform live again, only that he [...] "won't tour for this album". Visconti told The Daily Telegraph that Bowie had not ruled out the possibility of several live shows but instead decided to focus on making records.|$|E

Then, he turned to Bennett, smiling: [...] "Tonight you come dinner. I must make body work". As he spoke, a great spasm of pain shook his body and blood gushed from an ear. Bennett thought: [...] "He has a {{cerebral}} haemorrhage. He will kill himself if he continues to force his body to move". But then he reflected: [...] "He has to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> If he allows his body to stop moving, he will die. He has power over his body".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1998, a Midlands-based leisure {{group was}} behind an £18 million {{bid for the}} club. Chairwoman Vicki Oyston met with representatives from the {{consortium}} to discuss a deal that would see her family relinquish their control of the club after almost eleven years. The bid was for the club and its Bloomfield Road site and was also designed to involve moving the club to a new stadium at Whyndyke Farm. Mrs Oyston admitted that it was [...] "fan power" [...] that had driven her to try and sell the club. [...] "I don't like bullies, but so-called fan power has cost the club {{a lot of money}} and made us question whether we should <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> on our own." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band took {{a simpler}} {{approach}} {{partly because the}} members felt the songs on ...And Justice for All were too long and complex. Hetfield said that radio airplay was not their intention, but because they felt [...] "we had pretty much done the longer song format to death," [...] and considered a good change doing songs with just two riffs and [...] "only taking two minutes to get the point across". Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity — [...] "We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters, That made us go too far, around Master of Puppets and Justice, {{in the direction of}} trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'" [...] – and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: [...] "Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song — you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The deaths drew intense {{public and}} media scrutiny. On July 14, Medicis had its sharpest one-day decline in stock price since February. News {{of the death}} and {{investigation}} received international coverage in various countries including Brazil, New Zealand, Finland, Spain, and the United Kingdom throughout July and August. In early September, various Forbes writers, including true crime writer Cathy Scott and lawyer Victoria Pynchon, expressed doubts about the investigators' conclusions; Pynchon described the ruling as an [...] "embarrassing public blunder." [...] The Daily Beast published a column by trial lawyer Roy Black, in which he criticized [...] "half-baked theories" [...] about Zahau's death, in particular stating the lack of DNA evidence: [...] "How could anyone <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> without leaving behind a scintilla of microscopic evidence? They {{would have to have}} been wearing a full rubber suit or some type of space suit and levitated over the scene." [...] He called on the media and public to [...] "stop calling it murder." [...] On September 19, it was reported that local Coronado author Kathleen McKenna would be writing a book on the case; McKenna expressed doubts that Zahau's death was a suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Eckford {{extended}} extensive {{credit to}} the United States Government during the war, going bankrupt in the process because of difficulty the government had in paying him, although he never doubted that it eventually would. His efforts, {{along with those of}} Adam and Noah Brown, were key to American success on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Chauncey wrote in praise of Eckford to Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 8 October 1813, saying, [...] "...yet as Mr. Eckford has built 4 vessels at this place, and has become acquainted with the resources and people of this part of the country, I think that he could have built sooner and perhaps cheaper than perhaps any other man, and as to his talents as a ship carpenter, I am bold {{to say that there is}} not his equal in the United States, or perhaps the world. His exertions are unexampled...," [...] and in a letter of 15 January 1814, Jones replied, [...] "The talents and zeal of Mr. Eckford the builder, is a source of great satisfaction and confidence, which assures me that though the enemy has made great progress in the building of his two largest vessels, he will be over taken and surpassed in this branch of service by the superior energy and judgment of Mr. Eckford." [...] In the words of maritime historian Howard I. Chapelle, [...] "It was Eckford's extraordinary ability to design, lay down, and build ships, ranging in size from a very small schooner to the largest frigates, working in a wilderness and in severe winter weather with sick or dissatisfied labor, and to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in extremely short periods of time, that maintained American superiority on Lake Ontario." [...] Chapelle continues, [...] "From a naval shipbuilding point of view, the outstanding men of the War of 1812 were Eckford and the Browns, Adam and Noah. Through the efforts of these three, the [...] Navy held control of the lakes and prevented the British from invading the North and Northwest ... No officer or constructor of the Navy accomplished more. There were no competitors to the Browns and Eckford among the navy yards, or in the contract shipyards along the coasts, [...] on the lakes... building was made infinitely more difficult than on the coast because of climate and geographical conditions, to say nothing of scarcities of labor and some materials." [...] One advantage Eckford and the Browns may have had was a lack of attention by US government officials to their activities; Federal officials focused their efforts on the coasts, where they greatly interfered with shipbuilding decisions and progress during the war.|$|E
