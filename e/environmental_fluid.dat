40|$|Pseudomonas cepacia has {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} important pathogen affecting cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We evaluated three selective media to assess their comparative potential for identification of patients colonized with P. cepacia and for efficacy of detection of P. cepacia in <b>environmental</b> <b>fluids.</b> Test organisms included P. cepacia isolates from CF patients (10 each from two CF centers), non-CF patients (10 isolates), and environmental sources (10 isolates). Microbiologic assays were done by the membrane filter procedure; filters were placed on P. cepacia medium (PCM), OFPBL, TB-T, MacConkey agar (MAC), and blood agar (BA) or Standard Methods (SM) sugar, and colonies were counted after incubation at 30 or 35 degrees C for 72 h. Mean recovery efficiencies (MREs) (mean CFU/ml on selective media compared with CFU/ml on BA controls) for environmental and non-CF P. cepacia and patient isolates from one CF center showed a rank order of PCM greater than OFPBL greater than TB-T; for isolates from a second CF center, a rank order of PCM greater than TB-T greater than OFPBL was obtained. MREs for CF center isolates were generally lower than for non-CF patients or environmental isolates on P. cepacia-selective media. With MAC, the MREs for each group of CF isolates were extremely low (14 and 2 %) compared with those for non-CF patient (47 %) or environmental (84 %) isolates. In laboratory and field studies, PCM and OFPBL showed good selectivity against bacteria commonly associated with CF patient respiratory secretions. These findings show that selective media {{should be used in}} clinical settings where P. cepacia is sought. With <b>environmental</b> <b>fluids</b> from CF centers, P. cepacia-selective media showed low selectivity against a variety of gram-negative water bacteria and appeared to afford little advantage over SM agar for isolating P. cepacia from environmental samples...|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic flow {{conditions}} allow {{the design of}} highly effec-tive, yet simple devices for on-chip sample preparation and cleanup. Over the past few years, Micronics has developed a num-ber of novel microfluidic structures that are compatible with com-plex samples such as whole blood or contaminated <b>environmental</b> <b>fluids.</b> The H-Filter is a technology based on the parallel laminar flow {{of two or more}} miscible streams in contact with each other. Such streams do not mix, but chemicals contained in these streams can diffuse from one stream into the other, with smaller molecules diffusing faster than larger ones. This principle can be used, for example, to remove salt from a solution containing DNA, or to extract smaller molecules from whole blood. The T-Sensor is based on the same laminar flow diffusion principle, but combines sam-ple preparation with self-calibration and detection. These devices can be used not only in stand-alone research and point-of-use test-ing applications, but they can also be integrated, as sample prepa-ration modules, into existing laboratory systems...|$|R

Further, there is increasing demand for web-based data services. Several browser-based data servers, on which geophysical-fluid data can be analyzed and visualized, have been developed. However, they are suitable only for initial “quick-looks” and not for subsequent research processes. As a solution, we developed data server software named Gfdnavi.

This paper describes its network features: web services, which {{is an important part}} of Gfdnavi’s programmability, and the functionality to search across multiple Gfdnavi servers. To develop the web services, we adopted the REST architecture. We also developed a client library to ensure access to web services in the programming language Ruby. Using this library, data can be analyzed and visualized on either the server side or client side. It also enables data handling on multiple servers.

Unfortunately, agglomeration has frequently been ignored in nanotoxicity studies, even though agglomeration {{would be expected to}} affect nanotoxicity since it changes the size, surface area, and sedimentation properties of the nanoparticles.

40|$|The {{research}} {{effort in}} the Waychunas group {{is focused on the}} characterization and measurement of processes at the mineral-water interfaces specifically related to the onset of precipitation. This effort maps into one of the main project groups with the Penn State University EMSI (CEKA) known as PIG (Precipitation Interest Group), and involves collaborations with several members of that group. Both synchrotron experimentation and technique development are objectives, with the goals of allowing precipitation from single molecule attachment to sub-monolayer coverage to be detected and analyzed. The problem being addressed is the change in reactivity of mineral interfaces due to passivation or activation by precipitates or sorbates. In the case of passivation, fewer active sites may be involved in reactions with <b>environmental</b> <b>fluids,</b> while in the activated case the precipitate may be much more reactive than the substrate, or result {{in the creation of a}} higher density of active sites. We approach this problem by making direct measurements of several types of precipitation reactions: iron-aluminum oxide formation on quartz and other substrates from both homogeneous (in solution) nucleation, and heterogeneous (on the surface) nucleation; precipitation and sorption of silicate monomers and polymers on Fe oxide surfaces; and development of grazing-incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) as a tool for in-situ measurement of precipitate growth, morphology and aggregation.

The output of the model is the predicted mine trajectory in air and water columns, burial depth/orientation in sediment, as well as height, area, and volume protruding. Model inputs consist of parameters of environment, mine characteristics, and initial release. This paper reviews near three decades’ effort on model development from one to three dimensions: (1) onedimensional models predict the vertical position of the mine’s center of mass (COM) with the assumption of constant falling angle, (2) two-dimensional models predict the COM position in the x,z plane and the rotation around the y-axis, and (3) three-dimensional models predict the COM position in the x,y,z space and the rotation around the x-, y-, and z-axes. These models are verified using the data collected from mine impact burial experiments. The one-dimensional model only solves one momentum equation (in the z-direction). It cannot predict the mine trajectory and burial depth well. The twodimensional model restricts the mine motion in the x,z plane (which requires motionless for the <b>environmental</b> <b>fluids)</b> and uses incorrect drag coefficients and inaccurate sediment dynamics. The prediction errors are large in the mine trajectory and burial depth prediction (six to ten {{times larger than the}} observed depth in sand bottom of the Monterey Bay).
