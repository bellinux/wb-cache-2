25|$|Gorbanevskaya {{was arrested}} on 24 December 1969, while {{compiling}} issue 11. She managed to hide the source papers, which had handwriting which could identify other authors, in <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> additional information was hidden in her coat. The KGB missed both of these hiding places. Issue 11 was released on schedule and included a report on Gorbanevskaya's arrest. She was released, but again arrested in 1970 and put on trial. Diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, Gorbanevskaya was held in a Soviet psychiatric prison until February 1972. Eventually she was {{allowed to return to}} Moscow and in 1975 she emigrated to France.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt was tutored privately {{and with}} the {{encouragement}} of her aunt Anna [...] "Bamie" [...] Roosevelt, 15-year-old Eleanor was sent to Allenswood Academy, a private finishing school in Wimbledon, outside London, England, where she was educated from 1899 to 1902. The headmistress, Marie Souvestre, was a noted feminist educator who sought to cultivate independent thinking in young women. Souvestre took {{a special interest in}} Roosevelt, who learned to speak French fluently and gained self-confidence. Roosevelt and Souvestre maintained a correspondence until March 1905, when Souvestre died, and after this Eleanor placed Souvestre's portrait on <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> brought her letters with her. Eleanor's first cousin Corinne Douglas Robinson, whose first term at Allenswood overlapped with Eleanor's last, said that when she arrived at the school, Eleanor was [...] "'everything' at the school. She was beloved by everybody." [...] Roosevelt wished to continue at Allenswood, but she was summoned home by her grandmother in 1902 to make her social debut.|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Ziva {{seems to have}} become {{involved}} with someone while in Israel but refuses to discuss it. In [...] "Nine Lives", after she plans a visit to Israel, Tony looks through <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> finds {{a picture of an}} unidentified man (Merik Tadros). Before she leaves, he tells her to have a good trip ("Nisiya Tova") in Hebrew, demonstrating that he had at least made some effort to learn that phrase. In [...] "Cloak", Ziva disobeys Gibbs' orders to not engage during a war game, attacking the guards to defend Tony. Later they both say that they are [...] "tired of pretending": Tony about the politics in the hunt for the mole within the team, which required the team to withhold information from each other, and Ziva for reasons undisclosed.|$|E

2500|$|Dayna Klein, a Federation {{employee}} who was five months pregnant, heard the shots being fired {{and as she}} went to the door of her office, Haq fired at her abdomen, but the bullet hit her raised arm. According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled to <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E

During the enforced physical inactivity, she used the time to refine her drawing ability by working through several [...] "learn-to-draw" [...] books.
