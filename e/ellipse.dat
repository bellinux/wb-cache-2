5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an <b>ellipse,</b> but akin to an <b>ellipse</b> that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E

40|$|Much recent {{effort has}} focused on glassy and jamming {{properties}} of spherical particles. Very {{little is known about}} such phenomena for non-spherical particles, and we take a first step by studying <b>ellipses.</b> We find important differences between the dynamical and structural properties of disks and two-dimensional <b>ellipses</b> subject to continuous Couette shear. In particular, <b>ellipses</b> show slow dynamical evolution, without a counterpart in disks, in the mean velocity, local density, orientational order, and local stress. starting from an unjammed state, <b>ellipses</b> can first jam under shear, and then slowly unjam. The slow unjamming process is understood as a result of gradual changes in their orientations, leading to a denser packing. For disks, the rotation of particles only contributes to relaxation of frictional forces, and hence, does not significantly cause structural changes. For the shear-jammed states, the global building up and relaxation of stress, which occurs in the form of stress avalanches, is qualitatively different for disks and <b>ellipses,</b> and is manifested by different forms of rate-dependence for <b>ellipses</b> vs. disks. Unlike the weak rate dependence typical for many granular systems, <b>ellipses</b> show power-law dependence on the shearing rate, Ω. Comment: Submitted to Physical Review Letter...|$|R

5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the <b>ellipse</b> (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary <b>ellipse.</b> If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
