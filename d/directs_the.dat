5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer.

This rule <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
