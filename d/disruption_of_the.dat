5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|Three-quarters {{of people}} with LEMS also have <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{autonomic}} nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge.

By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

40|$|It {{is universally}} {{recognized}} that biological rhythms in the frail elderly with {{disorders such as}} dementia are liable to disruptions; however, studies exploring <b>the</b> characteristic features <b>of</b> biological rhytims in the elderly and <b>the</b> factors causing <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhytims in the frail elderly, especially those in need of care and residing in nursing homes are still few. We conducted the present study to examine <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biological rhytlms and <b>the</b> factors causing <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhythms in 50 residents of special nursing homes for the elderly (9 men and 41 women) using a contmuous portable instrument.

The results also suggested <b>the</b> possible involvement <b>of</b> wake-sleep cycle reversal (P = 0. 032) in <b>the</b> rhythm <b>disruptions.</b> Activitles <b>of</b> daily living (P = 0. 046), poriomania (P = 0. 039), and participation in actions (P = 0. 039) were also {{found to be significant}} factors contributing to <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biological rhytlms.

5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E

For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E

5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E

5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed.

This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper.

Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
