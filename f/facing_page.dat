5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each <b>facing</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wong {{sent the}} {{newsreel}} footage on a U.S. Navy ship to Manila and from there, {{the film was}} flown to New York City aboard a Pan American World Airways airliner. Beginning in mid-September 1937, the newsreel was shown to movie theater audiences, estimated a month later to number 50 {{million people in the}} U.S. and 30million outside of the U.S. and the still image of the crying baby was printed in Hearst Corporation newspapers and affiliates, some 25 million copies. A further 1.75million non-Hearst newspaper copies showed the image in the U.S., and 4million more people saw it as a matte reproduction in other newspapers. Some 25million people saw it internationally. It first appeared in Life magazine on October 4, 1937, at which point it was estimated that 136million people had seen it. On the <b>facing</b> <b>page</b> in Life magazine, another photograph showed the baby on a stretcher receiving medical care.|$|E

6000|$|So far as {{they are}} quite clear, they are imperfect, and knowingly imperfect, if {{considered}} as painters of real appearances; but by means of this very imperfection or conventionalism, they often give certain facts which are more necessary to their purpose than these outward appearances. For instance, in Fig. 2 of Plate 25, <b>facing</b> <b>page</b> 32, I requested Mr. Le Keux to facsimile, as far as might be, {{the look of the}} daguerreotype; and he has admirably done so. But if Albert Durer had drawn the wall between those towers, he would have represented it with all its facts distinctly revealed, as in Fig. 1; and in many respects this clear statement is precious, though, so far as regards ocular truth, it is not natural. A modern sketcher of the [...] "bold" [...] school would represent the tower as in Fig. 3; that is to say, in a manner just as trenchant and firm, and therefore ocularly false, as Durer's; but, in all probability, which involved entireness of fallacy or ignorance as to the wall facts; rendering the work nearly valueless; or valuable only in color or composition; not as draughtsmanship.|$|E
6000|$|... [20] It {{is often}} {{extremely}} difficult to distinguish properly between [...] the Leonardesque manner, in which local color is denied altogether, [...] and the Turneresque, in which local color at its highest point in [...] the picture is merged in whiteness. Thus, Albert Durer's noble [...] "Melancholia" [...] is entirely Leonardesque; the leaves on her head, her [...] flesh, her wings, her dress, the wolf, the wooden ball, and the [...] rainbow, being all equally white on the high lights. But my drawing [...] of leaves, <b>facing</b> <b>page</b> 120, Vol. III., is Turneresque; because, [...] though I leave pure white to represent the pale green of leaves and [...] grass in high light, I give definite increase of darkness to four of [...] the bramble leaves, which, in reality, were purple, and leave a dark [...] withered stalk nearly black, though it is in light, where it crosses [...] the leaf in the centre. These distinctions could only be properly [...] explained by a lengthy series of examples; which I hope to give some [...] day or other, but have not space for here.|$|E
