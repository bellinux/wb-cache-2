40|$|A {{city bus}} is {{probably}} one of the harshest operating environments for a vehicle transmission. The average operating speed is low, while frequent stops require swift acceleration from standstill. The options for the placement of transmission and suspension components are highly restricted as the passenger space must be as large as possible, with a completely <b>flat</b> <b>vehicle</b> floor for ease of passenger movement, and ground clearance is kept as low as possible to facilitate the entry and exit of passengers. Therefore, it is common to place the engine and gearbox at the rear end, and power is transmitted to the wheels via a propeller shaft and a rigid rear axle, effectively ruling out any completely level floor design. An improvement is offered by the hydrostatic transmission, using high pressure fluid for the power transmisison. The fluid flows from a pump to a motor via relatively small diameter pipes, enabling the design of a completely level floor. The hydrostatic transmission offers continuous variation of transmission ratios and the possibility that hydraulic motors can be placed very close to the wheels, thus enabling all- wheel drive and increased passenger space. Finally, hydraulic accumulators can be added to a hydrostatic transmission in order to recover and reuse kinetic energy which would otherwise be lost by braking...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} trajectory planning and state estimation algorithms for aggressive flight of micro aerial vehicles in known, obstacle-dense environments. Finding aggressive but dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories in cluttered environments requires trajectory optimization and state estimation {{in the full}} state space of the vehicle, which is usually computationally infeasible on realistic timescales for real vehicles and sensors. We first build on previous work of van Nieuwstadt and Murray and Mellinger and Kumar, to show how a search process can be coupled with optimization in the output space of a differentially <b>flat</b> <b>vehicle</b> model to find aggressive trajectories that utilize the full maneuvering capabilities of a quadrotor. We further extend this work to vehicles with complex, Dubins-type dynamics and present a novel trajectory representation called a “Dubins–Polynomial trajectory”, which allows us to optimize trajectories for fixed-wing vehicles. To provide accurate state estimation for aggressive flight, we show how the Gaussian particle filter can be extended to allow laser rangefinder localization to be combined with a Kalman filter. This formulation allows similar estimation accuracy to particle filtering in the full vehicle state but with {{an order of magnitude}} more efficiency. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the execution of quadrotor and fixed-wing trajectories in cluttered environments. We show results of aggressive flight at speeds of up to 8 [*]m/s for the quadrotor and 11 [*]m/s for the fixed-wing aircraft. Micro Autonomous Consortium Systems and TechnologyUnited States.

50|$|When mounted {{longitudinally}} in a <b>vehicle,</b> <b>flat</b> engines {{with up to}} six cylinders are short, low, and wide.

50|$|The {{western side}} of the island is free of {{mangroves}} and dominated by low energy beaches fronted by wide sand flats. Weeroona Island beach wraps around the western half of the 1 km wide island for 1.6 km, the eastern half being surrounded by mangroves.

Shorelines are backed by grassy slopes which rise to a 30 m high island crest. The beaches are fronted by a narrow strip of sand, behind which vegetated tidal flats extend for hundreds of metres north and south. The western side is an exception to this, where the spread of tidal flat vegetation is limited by the tidal channel.|$|R

The primary business is removing unauthorized vehicles from parking spaces. [...] The business claims the largest fleet of wheel-lift and <b>flatbed</b> towing <b>vehicles</b> in Chicago. [...] The business model is such that towing companies engage in exclusive towing contracts for properties and collect fees from owners of unauthorized vehicles that have been towed. However, the company also provides vehicle repossession services and parking lot management services which include snow removal, pot hole patching, striping, and complete parking lot construction. [...] As a private company enforcing private property parking, the company does not issue parking tickets in addition to charging for towing and storage, unlike the City of Chicago, which does for parking in tow zones. It has towed over 30,000 unauthorized parked cars since September 5, 2005, which makes it Chicago's leading relocator.|$|R

This article presents a new locomotion concept, adapted to both flat and complex rough terrain by combining the advantages of wheeled and legged vehicels. MATE- 1 is a bipedal robot equipped with two special grippers which provide the capability of walking and climbing in rough terrain and rolling on smooth surfaces. A subtle design of the robot’s mechanical structure allows combining different locomotion concepts, thus increasing its mobility and its capacity to adapt to the terrain without exceed in weight or size...|$|R
50|$|The {{court also}} found that the BLM failed to follow route {{restrictions}} established in the agency’s own conservation plan, resulting in the establishment of hundreds of illegal OHV routes during the previous three decades. The plan violated the BLM's own regulations, specifically the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups including the Friends of Juniper <b>Flats,</b> Community Off-road <b>Vehicle</b> Watch, California Native Plant Society, The Center for Biological Diversity, The Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society who initiated the legal challenge in late 2006.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{wheelset}} {{does not}} need to lock up completely in order for damage to be caused. If the slide is significant, heat can build up in the contact patch between wheel and rail sufficiently to permanently modify the crystalline structure of the wheel's steel. The steel becomes more brittle (martensite) which leads to cavities forming in the wheel. Wheel <b>flats</b> on railway <b>vehicles</b> are very evident by their characteristic “bang-bang” in time with the speed of the train. It is normally necessary to use a wheel lathe to remove a layer of wheel tread caused by a severe flat or cavity, which reduces the life of the wheel and is a major operating cost to the rail industry.|$|R

The prop-shaft went {{down the middle of}} the two battery boxes to the driven wheels. At the steered end was a driver's platform, with a steering tiller (like a narrowboat) and controller, with foot pedal operating brake and on/off switch.

Peak convective heating on the afterbody occurs on the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>flat</b> stern with a value of 5. 9 % of the stagnation value.
