60|$|The {{tortoise}} {{picked up}} {{the end of the}} bone in his mouth {{and went back to the}} elephant. 'I will fasten this to your leg,' said he, 'in the same way as it is fastened to mine, and we must both pull as hard as we can. We shall soon see which is the stronger.' So he wound it carefully round the elephant's leg, and tied it in a <b>firm</b> <b>knot.</b> 'Now!' cried he, plunging into a thick bush behind him.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{different}} styles of ribbons affixed to the hats indicated different messages about the wearer. Several popular messages included: An arrow-like ribbon which indicated a girl was single but had already given her heart to someone, a <b>firm</b> <b>knot</b> which signaled marriage or a flamboyant bow which indicated the wearer was single and interested in mingling.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{length of}} rope is {{attached}} to the loop by means of a bowline or any other <b>firm</b> <b>knot,</b> and this rope is then passed through the loop once more leaving enough spare to reach over the animal and place the so-formed loop of rope in the hook on the other side. This double {{length of rope}} that is passed over the pack is then carefully twisted at least twice (the above diagram shows many more twists, but two are generally sufficient), with one twist being forced over towards {{the right side of the}} animal, while the other is left on its left, and then it is placed back in the hook, before tightening up the slack.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was half}} {{surprised}} to find she obeyed the signal, for she crouched there, white-faced and open-mouthed, watching; but I have often observed that women are almost always brave in the great emergencies. She pinned on the plaid and let it down with commendable quickness. I doubled it, and tied <b>firm</b> <b>knots</b> in the four corners, {{so as to make}} it into a sort of basket; then I fastened it at each corner with a piece of the rope, crossed in the middle, till it looked like one of the cages they use in mills for letting down sacks with. As soon as it was finished, I said, 'Now, just try to crawl into it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Draw now the {{threefold}} <b>knot</b> <b>firm</b> on the ninefold bands, [...] And the Law that ye make {{shall be}} law after {{the rule of}} your lands. [...] This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom, [...] This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom. [...] The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will, [...] Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988 and 1989, two London bankers, Nicholas Sossidis and Stephen Partridge-Hicks {{launched}} {{the first two}} SIVs for Citigroup, called Alpha Finance Corp. and Beta Finance Corp. Alpha had a maximum leverage of 5 times its capital with each asset requiring 20% of capital irrespective of its credit quality. Beta had leverage of up to 10 times capital but leverage was based on risk weightings of the assets. In 1993, Sossidis and Partridge-Hicks left Citigroup to form their own management <b>firm,</b> Gordian <b>Knot,</b> located in London's Mayfair. [...] "Alpha Finance was created in response to volatility in the capital markets at the time. Investors wanted a highly-rated vehicle that would yield more stable returns on their capital, said Henry Tabe, a managing director for Moody's Investors Service's London office." [...] Henry Tabe provides further historical background in his book on how SIVs unravelled during the crisis and lessons that {{can be learned from}} the sector's extinction.|$|R
5000|$|The Kanga is {{an article}} that allows the Sikh to care {{for his or her}} unshorn long hair, Kesh. The kanga is usually tucked behind the [...] "Rishi Knot" [...] and tied under the turban. It is to be used twice daily to comb and keep the hair in a disentangled and tidy condition. It {{represents}} the importance of discipline and cleanliness to a Sikh way of life and is used to keep the hair healthy, clean, shining and tangle-free. The Kanga is tucked under the rishi knot to keep the rishi <b>knot</b> <b>firm</b> and in place.|$|R
6000|$|Truly ye come of The Blood; {{slower to}} bless than to ban; Little used {{to lie down}} at the bidding of any man. Flesh of the flesh that I bred, bone of the bone that I bare; Stark as your sons shall be--stern as your fathers were. Deeper than speech our love, {{stronger}} than life our tether, But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together. My arm is nothing weak, my strength is not gone by; Sons, I have borne many sons, but my breasts are not dry, Look, I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors, That ye may talk together, your Barons and Councillors-- Wards of the Outer March, Lords of the Lower Seas, Ay, talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees!-- That ye may talk together, brother to brother's face-- Thus for the good of your peoples--thus for the Pride of the Race. Also, we will make promise. So long as The Blood endures, I shall know that your good is mine: ye shall feel that my strength [...] is yours: In the day of Armageddon, at the last great fight of all, That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall. Draw now the threefold <b>knot</b> <b>firm</b> on the ninefold bands, And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands. This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom, This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom. The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will, Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still. Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you, After the use of the English, in straight-flung words and few. Go to your work and be strong, halting not in your ways, Balking the end half-won for an instant dole of praise. Stand to your work and be wise--certain of sword and pen, Who are neither children nor Gods, but men in a world of men! ...|$|R
