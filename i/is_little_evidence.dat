5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{about the}} pay-scales of {{auxiliary}} centuriones and decuriones, {{but these are}} also believed to have amounted to several times that of a miles.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{concerning}} {{the impact of}} hereditary influence in rumination syndrome. However, case reports involving entire families with rumination exist.|$|E

50|$|By 2012 there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that the}} halt had ever existed, though the {{trackbed}} was clearly defined both on satellite imagery {{and on the}} ground.|$|R
5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a {{significant}} effect on wild populations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E

2500|$|A 2016 {{study using}} the Dunedin cohort found that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that T. gondii {{was related to}} {{increased}} risk of psychiatric disorder, poor impulse control, personality aberrations or neurocognitive impairment".|$|R
5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of it before the 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} yoga and there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{as to what}} the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E
50|$|Most {{candidates}} {{were described as}} either Liberals or Conservatives but these allegiances were fluid and, in some cases, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of a connection between candidates and local Liberal or Conservative party organisations.|$|R
50|$|Bone {{fragments}} {{found at}} the site came mostly from cattle (16.4%), sheep and goats (10.7%) and horses (10.7%). Farming at the site {{seems to have been}} mostly pastoral; there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of arable cultivation.|$|R

5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and {{increase the risk of}} certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E
5|$|The area {{first saw}} {{substantial}} population around A.D. 150, during the Middle Woodland period. At least three mound centers – Cold Springs, Little River, and Lingerlonger – developed, along with smaller settlements. The inhabitants had similar ceramics styles and there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of corn agriculture. During the Late Woodland period, the mound sites were abandoned {{and the population}} dispersed. Inhabitants developed simple pottery known as Vining Stamped ware, and primarily lived in small, corn-farming homesteads {{in and around the}} Oconee valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
50|$|Dore also {{presided over}} a {{committee}} which inquired into a suspected Irish conspiracy. Unfortunately, there appeared to <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> for a conspiracy, let alone an attempt at insurrection. Nevertheless, Dore ordered severe punishments for those thought to have planned an insurrection.|$|R
50|$|What Bernstein {{meant was}} that he {{believed}} that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse {{as a result of}} its internal contradictions, as by the mid-1890s there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.|$|R
3000|$|Classically, the {{decision}} to transfuse is driven by arbitrary [...] "triggers" [...] (hemoglobin level) rather than clinical or physiologic findings. Data from the CRIT study [5], in which there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that age or comorbidities significantly influenced transfusion practice, tend to support this view.|$|R
5|$|The oldest known {{version of}} the poem is the Northumbrian aelda recension. The {{surviving}} witnesses to this text, Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date to at least the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede's own monastery and lifetime, though there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.|$|E
5|$|The western carrot {{emerged in}} the Netherlands in the 17th century, There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those {{countries}} as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> for this. The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{military}} action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserre's reign saw {{the growth of the}} administration, and the effective birth of the nomarchs, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.|$|E
50|$|In {{total to}} date, 559 {{patients}} {{have participated in}} clinical trials involving Cloderm, and there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of local and/or systemic adverse effects. Specifically, only 4.4 percent experienced adverse events, {{most of which were}} local application-site reactions, such as dryness, stinging, burning, or itching.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, {{two reports}} (one by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General {{and one by}} the GAO) harshly criticized SPOT {{on the basis that}} there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> the program <b>was</b> effective. The GAO report also {{recommended}} that the program be defunded.|$|R
5000|$|While {{cryotherapy}} {{is widely}} used, {{there appears to}} <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> as to its efficacy that has been replicated or shown in large controlled studies. Also its long term side effects have not been studied. [...] Commonly reports regarding cryotherapy suggest further research is needed.|$|R
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of any {{visits by}} eminent {{people to the}} castle, {{although}} there is a belief that in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the upkeep of its chapel. EdwardII certainly visited the castle and was there for three days in November 1323, during which time he also visited Norton Priory.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{occupation}} in the Motul de San José area during the Late Postclassic, from AD 1250 to AD 1697. It {{is possible that}} La Trinidad de Nosotros was Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Martín de Ursúa {{after the fall of}} the Itza capital Noj Petén to the Spanish in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been identified by archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{vanadium}} or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. Vanadium pentoxide {{was reported}} to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
50|$|In adults {{there was}} no {{increased}} risk of reported adverse events in trials.
