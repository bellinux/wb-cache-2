50|$|In EGW, {{the heat}} of the welding arc causes the {{electrode}} and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded. This molten metal solidifies from the bottom up, joining the parts being welded together. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a separate shielding gas, or by the gas produced by the disintegration of a flux-cored electrode wire. The electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable <b>electrode</b> <b>guide</b> tube, like the one used in electroslag welding, or a moving head. When the consumable guide tube is used, the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded, the electrode, and the guide tube. The moving head variation uses an assembly of an <b>electrode</b> <b>guide</b> tube which travels upwards as the weld is laid, keeping it from melting.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is a widespread}} machining method for the die and mold industry. This method can machine all conductive materials, including hard-to-cut metals, because the machining process uses electro-thermal energy without a cutting force. During EDM, discharge sparks remove not only the material of a workpiece but also the material of an electrode. This machining mechanism thereby causes electrode wear, which creates serious problems, including make-shape errors and low productivity. In order to overcome such problems, a new EDM method using a strip electrode (strip EDM) was developed in this study. Strip EDM uses a continuously applied strip electrode similar to the wire electrode in wire EDM. In the suggested strip-electrode method, a conductive strip moves on the <b>electrode</b> <b>guide.</b> The worn strip is removed, and a new one is supplied continuously. Therefore, the tool electrode acquires no wear during the machining process. This method uses a conductive strip that is made of brass. In the practical machining process, the strip EDM method was applied to EDM milling and EDM turning and their machining characteristics were compared with general EDM methods...|$|E

The conventional electrospinning process requires a grounded electrode on which highly charged electrospun ultrafine fibers are deposited.

An electrohydrody-namic process complemented with field-controllable electrodes (an auxiliary <b>electrode</b> and <b>guiding</b> <b>electrodes)</b> and an air blowing system was used to produce a membrane, with a considerably reduced charge and low remnant sol-vent concentration compared to one fabricated using the conventional method.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, {{electrodes}} are {{pressed against the}} body and retract in a spring-loaded manner into the electrode housings. Polytetrafluoroethylene, resin (PTFE, Teflon®) <b>electrode</b> <b>guides</b> are built into the electrode housings to reduce friction with the spring-loaded electrode rods, which {{move in and out}} to conform to the body-surface. By applying pressure with metal springs, approximately the same electrode pressure can be achieved on the chest, side, and back. When a subject breathes during measurement, the contour of the body is physically altered. Since each spring-loaded electrode applies pressure independently, electrode lateral position shift is minimized and spring-loaded extension and retraction during breathing allows each electrode to follow body movement and maintain a consistent state of contact. Each electrode rod has a copper-zinc alloy hemispherical head that increases the contact area to reliably detect electric potential induced on the body-surface. Electrode diameter is 1.0  cm with a 35  mm spacing between center-points of adjacent electrodes. With this electrode design, manual thus time-consuming adhesive-attachment of individual electrodes in conventional body-surface electrocardiograph system is avoided, and since the electrodes are reusable, there is no waste of resources and no additional recurring costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} possible relationships between activities of the individual muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall {{and the development of}} pressure within the abdominal cavity. Intra‐muscular activity was recorded bilaterally from transversus abdominis, obliquus internus, obliquus externus and rectus abdominis with fine‐wire <b>electrodes</b> <b>guided</b> into place using real‐time ultrasound. Intra‐abdominal pressure was measured intragastrically using a micro tip pressure transducer. Six males were studied during loading and movement tasks with varied levels of intra‐abdominal pressure. During both maximal voluntary isometric trunk flexion and extension, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained constant, while all other abdominal muscles showed a marked reduction during extension. When maximal isometric trunk flexor or extensor torques were imposed upon a maximal Valsalva manoeuvre, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained comparable within and across conditions, whereas obliquus internus, obliquus externus and rectus abdominis activities either markedly increased (flexion) or decreased (extension). Trunk twisting movements showed reciprocal patterns of activity between the left and right sides of transversus abdominis, indicating an ability for torque development. During trunk flexion‐extension, transversus abdominis showed less distinguished changes of activity possibly relating to a general stabilizing function. In varied pulsed Valsalva manoeuvres, changes in peak intra‐abdominal pressure were correlated with mean amplitude electromyograms of all abdominal muscles, excluding rectus abdominis. It is concluded that the coordinative patterns shown between the muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall are task specific based upon demands of movement, torque and stabilization.

30|$|The {{institutional}} review board of the Charité approved this study (ISRCTN 77569430), and written informed consent of legal proxies was obtained. We screened ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation on three of five consecutive days within the first week. Conventional nerve conduction studies were performed within 14  days by portable 2 -Channel Keypoint Medtronic equipment (Skovlunde, Denmark) [1]. We performed sensory and motor nerve conduction studies using surface electrodes as follows: sensory nerve conduction velocity and sensory nerve action potentials of the sural nerve/median nerve followed by motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential after nerve stimulation of the median/peroneal/tibial nerve (neCMAP). Nerve conduction studies were categorized according to the normal values of the neurophysiological laboratory of the Charité. Electromyography was performed to assess spontaneous activity using concentric needle electrodes in the extensor digitorum communis muscle and tibialis anterior muscles. To assess compound muscle action potential after direct muscle stimulation (dmCMAP), we placed a conventional stimulating surface electrode longitudinally over the muscle fibers just proximal to the distal tendon insertion. For recordings of dmCMAP, we used disposable concentric needle electrodes (length 25 or 37  mm; diameter 0.46  mm) and stimulated the muscle with gradually increasing strength (from 10 to 100  mA) using pulses of 0.1  ms in a duration delivered at 1  Hz. The recording electrode was placed 15 – 50  mm proximal to the stimulating <b>electrode,</b> <b>guided</b> by a muscle twitch. If there was no twitch visible, the recording electrode was placed in four different directions {{in order not to}} miss small amplitudes. In cases were no responses were obtained, the muscle was assumed to be inexcitable. The responses evoked were measured peak to peak. Muscle fiber action potentials were recorded using filter settings between 500  Hz and 10  kHz. Whenever possible, we examined the tibialis anterior muscle in the lower limb and the extensor digitorum communis muscle in the upper limb. Critical illness myopathy was diagnosed according to standard criteria, including a dmCMAP of less than < 3  mV [10]. CIP was diagnosed according to standard criteria, including reduced motor and sensory nerve amplitudes [10]. Pathological spontaneous activity and reduced neCMAP were classified as unspecific and unable to differentiate between myopathy or neuropathy since it is a typical finding in both features.

Improvements in mass measurement accuracy are pursued through the study of chemical mass shifts, i. e. large, compound-dependent inaccuracies known to occur in traps with non-optimized geometry and believed {{to be related to}} ion structure. Experiments and simulations are used to elucidate the cause these shifts, and they indicate that the chemical mass shift is the result of two interacting factors: (i) delayed ion ejection from the trap during mass analysis due to field imperfections associated with the end-cap electrode apertures; (ii) the compound-dependent modification of this delay by collisions with the bath gas. The shifts are removed by appropriate manipulation of the ion trap geometry, by careful choice of resonance ejection working point, or by performing the mass analysis scan in the reverse direction. Use of the chemical mass shift for isomer distinction is demonstrated.

Each day one reward arm was selected to deliver six drops of water (at 1 s intervals) the others provided only one drop per visit. After 32 visits, probe trials were intermittently presented among training trials. Here, all four arms were lit and offered the previously assigned reward.

This study focuses on the evaluating the feasibility of RFA and usefulness of PET scan in lung tumors after RFA procedure. Patients and methods Between November 1999 and May 2002, 50 patients with primary or metastasis pulmonary tumors underwent RFA procedure. The <b>electrode</b> was <b>guided</b> to the target areas using computerized tomography (CT). Tumors smaller than 3. 5 cm were given single RFA, while tumors larger than 3. 5 cm received RFA to multiple sites. Maximum 4 lesions or 6 target areas were treated during one operating procedure. Whole body and/or lung PET images were acquired; identical site CT images and chest X-ray were taken 1 week before and after RFA. Results Of the 50 patients, 17 had single lesions while rest had multiple lesions. Tumors smaller than 3. 5 cm were completely dissipated after RFA. In tumors larger than 3. 5 cm, the part within 3. 5 cm diameter dissipated. While CT showed that tumor image became larger 1 to 2 weeks after RFA procedure. PET demonstrated tumor destruction in 70 % cases, compared to 38 % in CT. Conclusion The present study shows RFA to be safe and effective treatment option for lung tumors.

Study Design: Ex vivo animal study combined with computer modeling to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> placement and polarity selection. Methods: Rabbit costal cartilages were secured in a jig that approximated {{the shape of}} the rabbit auricle framework. Fi-nite element modeling was used to select the initial electrode geometry, polarity, spacing, and estimate dosimetry parameters. Porcine costal cartilage was utilized to refine the selection of dosing parameters. Parametric analysis was performed to deter-mine the effect of voltage and application time on tissue shape change. Next, rabbit rib cartilage was reshaped, varying volt-age and application time to identify the lowest parameters to produce acceptable shape change mimicking native auricular cartilage. Acceptable qualitative shape change was determined on a five-point Likert scale analyzed using one-way general linear analysis of variance. Confocal microscopy with live/dead cell viability analysis determined the degree of injury and the distribution of live and dead cells. Results: The minimum acceptable deformation of rabbit costal cartilage was found at 4 V– 3 minutes.

Previous studies in the rat and pig have shown that controlled necrosis can be safely produced by inserting platinum electrodes into normal liver' parenchyma and liver tumours. As with any new treatment it is mandatory to investigate the 'worst-case scenario' of inadvertent intravascular electrode placement in a large animal model before progressing to clinical trials. METHODS: Under ultrasound control in six pigs, electrodes were inserted into, or immediately adjacent to, an hepatic vein. An electrolytic 'dose' of 100 C was then administered {{and the evolution of}} the lesion was monitored using ultrasound. Venous blood was collected before and during the electrolysis to evaluate potential acid/base disturbances and animals were closely monitored during electrolysis and during their recovery until a full autopsy was performed 4 - 7 days after treatment. RESULTS: Gas bubbles were seen to enter the hepatic veins or interior vena cava during treatment in five of the six animals. There were no major complications as a consequence and all animals recovered and remained in a healthy state until they were killed. At autopsy one animal had complete thrombotic occlusion of the left hepatic vein. Otherwise, findings were normal. CONCLUSION: In the clinical setting, due to the use of ultrasound to <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> placement into the centre of a tumour, the electrodes should rarely juxtapose an hepatic vein.

The feasibility of minimal invasive electrode implantation near the DGN {{and the effectiveness of}} conditional stimulation to suppress IDCs at different amplitudes in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with DO were studied. SETTING: Radboud University Nijmegen MC, The Netherlands. METHODS: In eight healthy volunteers, a needle electrode was inserted from both a medial and lateral-to-midline site {{at the level of the}} pubic bone. <b>Electrode</b> insertion was <b>guided</b> by the genito-anal reflex (GAR) evoked by electrical stimulation and by sensation to this stimulation. In eight SCI patients with DO, the bladder was repeatedly filled and emptied partially in between. Conditional stimulation using a needle electrode was applied when an IDC was observed at urodynamics. Different amplitudes were used during each filling. Control cystometry was carried out before electrode insertion and after stimulation. RESULTS: The lateral implant approach was preferred, as it was easier to manoeuvre the needle along the pubic bone and fixate the needle. In SCI patients, the electrode was positioned successfully, and IDCs were suppressed (range 1 - 6 IDC suppressions) with conditional stimulation at maximum tolerable amplitude, except for one patient. Stimulation was less effective at lower amplitudes. Stimulation lowered the intensity of bladder sensations concomitant with IDC.

Fluorescence imaging <b>guided</b> <b>electrode</b> placement and pacing of the inferior and superior approaches to the AV node. Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) hearts had a prolonged atrio-His interval compared to the wild type, consistent with previous in vivo observations. The conduction time to the His bundle from the Cx 40 (-) AV nodal region that is superior to and immediately adjacent to the Cx 40 (+) lower node is slightly, but not significantly greater in Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) than wild-type hearts. A novel phenotype was also observed. Pacing the Cx 40 (-) inferior approach to the AV node with increasing stimulus strength led to progressive shortening of the stimulus-to-His conduction interval in wild-type but not Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) hearts. The strength of pacing at the Cx 40 (-) superior approach {{had no effect on}} the conduction interval in either group. The prolonged AV delay in the Nkx 2 - 5 (+/-) heart appears to arise before the Cx 40 (+) lower node. Whether the pacing phenotype explains the mutant's conduction defect is uncertain, but the observation adds to a number of unique properties of the inferior approach to the AV node...|$|R
40|$|Our {{inability}} to adequately treat many patients with refractory epilepsy caused by focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), surgical inaccessibility and failures are significant clinical drawbacks. The targeting of physiologic features of epileptogenesis in FCD and colocalizing functionality has enhanced completeness of surgical resection, the main determinant of outcome. Electroencephalography (EEG) -functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography are helpful in <b>guiding</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation and surgical treatment, and high-frequency oscillations help defining {{the extent of the}} epileptogenic dysplasia. Ultra high-field MRI has a role in understanding the laminar organization of the cortex, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is highly sensitive for detecting FCD in MRI-negative cases. Multimodal imaging is clinically valuable, either by improving the rate of postoperative seizure freedom or by reducing postoperative deficits. However, there is no level 1 evidence that it improves outcomes. Proof for a specific effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in FCD is lacking. Pathogenic mutations recently described in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes in FCD have yielded important insights into novel treatment options with mTOR inhibitors, which might represent an example of personalized treatment of epilepsy based on the known mechanisms of disease. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in children with epilepsy caused by structural abnormalities, especially FCD. It attenuates epigenetic chromatin modifications, a master regulator for gene expression and functional adaptation of the cell, thereby modifying disease progression. This could imply lasting benefit of dietary manipulation. Neurostimulation techniques have produced variable clinical outcomes in FCD. In widespread dysplasias, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has achieved responder rates > 50 %; however, the efficacy of noninvasive cranial nerve stimulation modalities such as transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) and noninvasive (nVNS) requires further study. Although review of current strategies underscores the serious shortcomings of treatment-resistant cases, initial evidence from novel approaches suggests that future success is possible...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the potential biomedical applications of polypyrrole (PPy). Electrical and topographic cues have been delivered to cells via composites of these conducting polymers, {{resulting in the}} successful control of cell behaviour. It was found that a clinically-relevant electrical stimulation protocol (250 Hz biphasic pulsed-current) delivered directly via PPy/poly(2 -methoxy- 5 -aniline sulfonic acid) (PMAS) films can significantly promote PC 12 nerve cell differentiation {{in the presence of}} nerve growth factor (NGF), and can initiate reversible neurite sprouting from PC 12 cell in the absence of NGF. The ability to promote neural outgrowth on PPy/PMAS has important implications for improving the neural/electrode interface, and this may be used to effect in nerve regeneration. The same biphasic 250 Hz electrical stimulations were applied to a monolayer of endothelial cells on PPy/heparin films, and significantly enhanced endothelial cell migration was observed as a result. Combined with the ease of fabrication on metallic stents and the antithrombotic function of heparin, these materials may be utilized for modification of stents to improve the re-endothelialization process after implantation. Finally, aligned PPy/poly(styrene-β-isobutylene-β-styrene) (SIBS) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated by vapor phase depositing PPy onto electrospun SIBS fibrous mats. It was shown that this novel material provided a conductive and biocompatible platform for PC 12 cell adhesion and differentiation. Neurite outgrowth was significantly influenced by the aligned fibers. High resolution AFM provided a closer inspection of the neurite outgrowths and revealed interesting physical interactions between the neurites and the aligned fibers. Aligned electroactive PPy/SIBS fibers have potential applications for improving the electrode-cellular interface of neural <b>electrodes</b> by encouraging <b>guided</b> neurite outgrowth toward the electrode through the use of electrical stimulation. The knowledge gained {{during the course of this}} study could form the basis for improving the cellular interface of neural electrodes and stents using conducting polymers...|$|R
40|$|Multipuncture {{radiofrequency}} ablation {{is expected}} to produce a large ablated area and reduce intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it requires considerable skill. This study evaluated the utility of a new simulator system for multipuncture radiofrequency ablation. To understand positioning of multipuncture electrodes on three-dimensional images, we developed a new technology by expanding real-time virtual ultrasonography. We performed 21 experimental punctures in phantoms. Electrode insertion directions and positions were confirmed on computed tomography, and accuracy and utility of the simulator system were evaluated by measuring angles and intersections for each electrode. Moreover, to appropriately assess placement of the three electrodes, puncture procedures {{with or without the}} simulator were performed by experts and non-experts. Technical success was defined as maximum angle and distance ratio, as calculated by maximum and minimum distances between electrodes. In punctures using 2 electrodes, correlations between angles on each imaging modality were strong (ultrasound vs. simulator: r = 0. 991, p< 0. 001, simulator vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 991, p< 0. 001, ultrasound vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 999, p< 0. 001). Correlations between distances in each imaging modality were also strong (ultrasound vs. simulator: r = 0. 993, p< 0. 001; simulator vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 994, p< 0. 001; ultrasound vs. computed tomography: r = 0. 994, p< 0. 001). In cases with 3 electrodes, distances between each electrode correlated strongly (yellow-labeled vs. red-labeled: r = 0. 980, p< 0. 001; red-labeled vs. blue-labeled: r = 0. 953, p< 0. 001; yellow-labeled vs. blue-labeled: r = 0. 953, p< 0. 001). Both angle and distance ratio (expert with simulator vs. without simulator; p = 0. 03, p = 0. 02) were significantly smaller in procedures performed by experts using the simulator system. The new simulator system appears to accurately <b>guide</b> <b>electrode</b> positioning. This simulator system could allow multipuncture radiofrequency ablation to be performed more effectively and comfortably...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectric chronic {{stimulation}} of the human motor cortex (ECSM) {{has been reported to}} alleviate chronic severe pain. However the mechanism of action of ECSM is still hypothetical. This is due mainly to the poor knowledge of, 1) the electric diffusion through the multiple structures beneath the epidural contacts (i. e. dura matter, cerebrospinal fluid space, arachnoid membrane, grey and white matter layers, pie mere and vascular tree), 2) the absence of consensus concerning the stimulation parameters (mono versus bipo-lar stimulation, cathodic or anodic current) and 3) the detailed cortical topography of the contacts. In this study we focused on the precise identification of the cortical areas covered by the electric contacts in a series of twelve patients operated on for ECSM. We propose a new automatic tool for topographic analysis able to compute 2 D maps from the 3 D anatomic MRI with bijective transformation (point-to-point correspondance). Anatomical regions of interest (AROIs) were visually identified, manually outlined and extracted (Iplan, BrainLab, Germany) for further analysis: 1) for the anatomic structures, on pre operative T 1 -weigthed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the frontal (superior or F 1, intermediate or F 2 and inferior or F 3), the pre central and the post central gyrus; 2) for the electrode contacts (Resume, Medtronic, USA), on post operative computerized tomography (CT). After getting white and gray matter membership maps by automatic segmentation, we produced a cortical mask to build a triangular mesh. We defined a homeomorphism between the 3 D mesh and a subset of R 2 and could apply in consequence the circle packing algorithm. We built depth maps (distance to the skull), distance-to-contact maps (distance to a given electrode contact) and anatomic structure maps. Results showed that it was easier to accurately define the location of the contact projection on the cortex allowing physicians to correlate the benefit with the topography. In particular, because of the unfolding, it was easier to integrate the cytoarchitectonics (i. e. the manually identified AROIs) knowledge in the analysis. Beyond the better understanding of ECSM and indirectly of the pathophysiologic process of chronic pain, this new tool might be used in the future for image <b>guided</b> <b>electrode</b> positioning...|$|R
