Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
2500|$|People think I asked Ellar, [...] "What {{did you do}} {{in school}} the other day? Let's make a scene about that!" [...] That never happened. The time we spent {{together}} was me just gauging where he was at in his life—what his concerns were {{and what he was}} doing. Then I would think, maybe we could move the camping trip up, and we can <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

And I said, 'If only I can copy him, and in my poor way do as he did, I too {{may be able to}} keep my little flock in the right path, the road which leads to God and Heaven'." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “A Roman {{administrator}} {{was about}} as religious as the late Winston Churchill. War has always been organized murder, arson and pillage. Modern war has achieved success in these enterprises which far exceeds the successes of earlier wars. Those of us, who are old enough, can remember that modern war can be conducted only {{by those who are}} ready to renounce all principles of Christian morality...Often there is no Christian way of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> e.g., engaging in war or the merchandising of heroin.” The New Testament Without Illusion, page 228, 232.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, when Goddard {{was fifteen}} years old, he wrote down {{a list of}} one hundred and twenty-seven goals he wanted to accomplish, from {{learning}} to type to climbing Mt. Everest. [...] "When I was fifteen," [...] he told LIFE magazine, [...] "all the adults I knew seemed to complain, 'Oh, if only I'd <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> when I was younger.'

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that sex and gender roles, as traditionally {{defined by the}} culture, place women in adouble bind or Catch- 22 situation (Heriot, 1983; Woolsey, 1977). Heriot defines the double bind as follows: "Society conveys to women that they should find their greatest happiness and fulfillment in giv-ing to and serving others {{and at the same}} time conveys on another level that they are not really valuable for <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> they shouldbe more likemen " (p. 11). This message is combined with "a further injunction that women are abnormal if they do not want to fulfill their role " (p...|$|R

5000|$|Like all archetypes, the puer is bi-polar, exhibiting both a [...] "positive" [...] and a [...] "negative" [...] aspect. The [...] "positive" [...] {{side of the}} puer {{appears as}} the Divine Child who symbolizes newness, {{potential}} for growth, hope for the future. He also foreshadows the hero that he sometimes becomes (e.g. Heracles). The [...] "negative" [...] side is the child-man who refuses {{to grow up and}} meet the challenges of life face on, waiting instead for his ship to come in and solve all his problems."For the time being one is <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that...</b> it is not yet what is really wanted, and there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about.... The one thing dreaded throughout by such a type of man is to be bound to anything whatever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{watch-dog}} of the North!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Do {{you dare}} {{to say to}} the Emperor that he shall not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that?</b> By all the images my mother worships I'll have you whipped through the Circus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I did not advise him. I {{only said}} that I {{had been talking}} to her about it. If he were to say to you that he had been recommending my mother to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> you would not take it amiss?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why have we need {{to protect}} {{ourselves}} now that the Britishers are turning tail?" [...] I asked in dull surprise, but I took my hands from my ears and wheeled about, knowing that if little Frenchie commanded me to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> I would obey if it lay within my power.|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, how unknown {{is a man}} to himself; or {{a public}} Body of men to itself! Aesop's fly sat on the chariot-wheel, exclaiming, What a dust I do raise! Great Governors, clad in purple with fasces and insignia, are governed by their valets, by the pouting of their women and children; or, in Constitutional countries, by the {{paragraphs}} of their Able Editors. Say not, I am <b>this</b> <b>or</b> that; I am <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that!</b> For thou knowest it not, thou knowest only the name it as yet goes by. A purple Nebuchadnezzar rejoices to feel himself now verily Emperor of this great Babylon which he has builded; and is a nondescript biped-quadruped, {{on the eve of}} a seven-years course of grazing! These Seven Hundred and Forty-five elected individuals doubt not but they are the First biennial Parliament, come to govern France by parliamentary eloquence: and they are what? And they have come to do what? Things foolish and not wise! ...|$|R
5000|$|Only an obstinate {{prejudice}} {{about this}} period could blind us {{to a certain}} change which comes over the merely literary texts as we pass from the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. In medieval stories there is, in one sense, plenty of “magic”. Merlin <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> “by his subtilty”, Bercilak resumes his severed head. But all these passages have unmistakably the note of “faerie” about them. But in Spenser, Marlowe, Chapman, and Shakespeare the subject is treated quite differently. “He to his studie goes”; books are opened, terrible words pronounced, souls imperiled. The medieval author seems to write for a public to whom magic, like knight-errantry, {{is part of the}} furniture of romance: the Elizabethan, for a public who feel that it might be going on in the next street. ... Neglect of this point has produced strange readings of The Tempest, which is in reality ... Shakespeare’s play on magia as Macbeth is his play on goeteia (p. 8) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In those days, it {{was found}} {{necessary}} to ask Christian people perpetually--Have you been <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>that?</b> For if you have, you are not only unfit {{to be called a}} Christian; you are unfit to be called a decent human being. And this, because there was every reason to suppose that they had been doing it; and that they would not tell of themselves, if they could possibly avoid it. So the Confessional arose, as a necessary element for educating savages into common morality and decency. And for the same reasons we employ it among the Negroes of Trinidad. Have no fears lest we should corrupt the minds of the young. They see and hear more harm daily than we could ever teach them, were we so devilishly minded. [...] There is vice now, rampant and notorious, in Port of Spain, which eludes even our Confessional. Let us alone to do our best. God knows {{we are trying to do}} it, according to our light.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Some {{part of them}} indeed, {{though they}} are foolish enough, as effects of a mad, inconsiderate rage, are yet English; as when a man swears he will <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or,</b> <b>that,</b> {{and it may be}} adds, [...] "God damn him he will;" [...] that is, [...] "God damn him if he don't." [...] This, though it be horrid in another sense, yet may be read in writing, and is English: but what {{language}} is this? ...|$|E
6000|$|All our {{motives are}} mixed, {{and it was}} not pure {{conscience}} which now wrought in Cornelia. It was pride, too, and a certain resentment that Charmian should assume authority to make Mr. Ludlow <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that.</b> For an instant she questioned whether he had not broken faith with her, and got Charmian to propose this; then she knew that it could not have been. She said coldly, [...] "I can't do it." ...|$|E
60|$|And that baptism is {{the fruit}} of faith, or that faith ought to be tied to take its first step in water baptism, in the instituted worship of God; this you must prove, it is not found {{expressed}} within the whole Bible. Faith acts according to its strength and as it sees, it is not tied or bound to any outward circumstance; one believeth he may, and another believeth he may not, either <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} an {{attitude}} not unknown in the crisis against which I should particularly like to protest. I should address my protest especially to those lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very short-sightedly, have occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which is impatient of these preliminary details about who <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> and whether it was right or wrong. They are satisfied with saying that an enormous calamity, called War, has been begun by {{some or all of}} us; and should be ended by some or all of us. To these people this preliminary chapter about the precise happenings must appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of human justice and historic continuity: but that they are specially and supremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and international peace.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon he {{related with}} invincible humor and vivid phraseology, the {{elaborate}} scheme of deception {{to which they}} had been forced during Jean's illness. Mrs. Clemens was very weak, so low that the slightest excitement--so the doctor warned us--might prove fatal; hence we were obliged to pretend that Jean was well but busy <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> in order that her mother might not suspect the truth of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|It for So. [...] "Going {{into the}} lion's cage is dangerous; {{you should not}} do it." [...] Do so is the better expression, as a rule, for the word it is a pronoun, meaning a thing, or object, and {{therefore}} incapable of being done. Colloquially we may say <b>do</b> it, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but in serious written discourse greater precision is desirable, and is better obtained, in most cases, by use of the adverb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} can, {{and of course}} she will. What I mean is that it never pays to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> because {{somebody}} may alter his will, or may make a will, or may not make a will. You become a slave for life, and then your dead tyrant leaves you a mourning-ring, and grins at you out of his grave. All the same she'll kick up a row, I fancy, and you'll have to bear the worst of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Every house, {{whether it}} had a flower-garden or not, had a woodshed, which was the place where a boy mostly {{received}} his friends, and made his kites and wagons, and laid his plots and plans for all the failures of his life. The other boys waited in the woodshed when he went in to ask his mother whether he might <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> or go somewhere. A boy always {{wanted to have a}} stove in the woodshed and fit it up for himself, but his mother would not let him, because he would have been certain to set the house on fire.|$|E
60|$|Intellectually {{there is}} hardly {{anything}} more than a certain will to believe, to divide the religious man who knows God to be utterly real, from the man who says that God is merely a formula to satisfy moral and spiritual phenomena. The former has encountered him, the other has as yet felt only unassigned impulses. One says God's will is so; the other that Right is so. One says God moves me to do this or that; the other the Good Will in me which I share with you and all well-disposed men, moves me to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that.</b> But the former makes an exterior reference and escapes a risk of self-righteousness.|$|E

All I can say in excuse is {{that since}} I got to {{managing}} plays I've kept looking ahead to making a big hit and getting a barrel of money-just as the old miners used to hope and watch.

6000|$|It {{was only}} natural that after this {{engagement}} Saul and I, egged on by Pierre, should talk quite seriously of forming a company of Minute Boys; but no sooner would we begin, and I strive to point out how we might <b>do</b> <b>this</b> thing <b>or</b> <b>that</b> which would advantage our colony of Virginia, than Saul would break in with the saying of Uncle 'Rasmus's, that where [...] "chillun an' women were mixed" [...] matters went awry.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a lesson}} to me. You start in to get a hundred percent. and you come out with that. It means, in a way, a reproof for Pride. I've thought of that, George--in the Night Watches. I was {{thinking}} this morning when I was shaving, that that's where the good of it all comes in. At the bottom I'm a mystic in these affairs. You calculate you're going to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> but at bottom who knows at all WHAT he's doing? When you most think you're doing things, they're being done right over your head. YOU'RE being done--in a sense. Take a hundred-to one chance, or one to a hundred--what does it matter? You're being Led." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{she would}} obey. Let the task be {{as hard as}} it might, she would obey. If he counselled her to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> she would follow his counsel,--because she owed him so much. If she had {{accepted}} the half of all his wealth without loving him, she owed him the more on that account. But she knew,--she could not but know,--that her intellect was brighter than his; and might it not be possible for her to lead him? Then she made efforts to lead her husband, and found that he was as stiff-necked as an ox. Mr. Kennedy was not, perhaps, a clever man; but {{he was a man who}} knew his own way, and who intended to keep it.|$|E
60|$|But I say, his denying to do {{thus for}} every man in the world, cannot {{properly}} {{be said to be}} because he is not heartily willing they should close with the tenders of the grace held forth in the gospel, and live. Wherefore you must consider that there is a distinction to be put between God's denying grace on reasonable terms, and denying it absolutely; and also that {{there is a difference between}} his withholding further grace, and of hindering men from closing with the grace at present offered; also that God may withhold much, when he taketh away nothing; yea, take away much, when once abused, and yet be just and righteous still. Further, God may deny to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> absolutely, when yet he hath promised to do, not only that, but more, conditionally. Which things considered, you may with ease conclude, that he may be willing to save those not elect, upon reasonable terms, though not without them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You chilluns hab done gone crazy! Gone crazy!" [...] he {{repeated}} again and again, and I stood helplessly by {{not knowing what}} to do; but little Frenchie set about soothing the old man's fears by explaining how it might be possible for us to <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and declaring we could keep Horry a prisoner in the loft so long as one of us stood close by to insure his silence, until Uncle 'Rasmus recovered a goodly measure of his former serenity.|$|R
60|$|I asked Captain Kirby what he {{had done}} with the rogues. He told me, nothing at all, and that the less one had to do with such fellows the better. At this I was vastly surprised, and that he had taken no steps {{to put an end to}} such a nest of vile, wicked, and bloody-minded wretches when he had it so clearly in his power to take {{fourteen}} of them at once; more especially as he should have known that if they got away from that place and to any of their companions they would bring the others not only about his ears, but of every other craft that might be lying in the harbor at the time. Something to this effect I said, whereat he flew into a mighty huff, and said that if I had seen half the experience that he had been through I would not be so free in my threats of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> to a set of wretches no better than so many devils from hell, who would cut a man's throat without any scruples either of fear or remorse.|$|R
