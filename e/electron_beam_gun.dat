Development and applications of high power thermionic <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> sources have been studied in this work. A detailed account of the three types, strip, line and hairpin thermionic <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> sources, which have been developed and experimented has been given. These sources are employed in a diode configuration with different beam trajectories (axial and transverse) and heating modes (directly and indirectly). Performance of these sources has been described at temperature and space charge limited modes of operation. We obtain constant and stable focal spots at the work site that are in good agreement with the designed dimensions of the sources. High emission current, low thermal efficiency and high power density at the work-site have been recorded with an extended life expectancy (up to 100 hours). This was possible through novel design parameters for these sources by protecting them from arcing and shortening even at high vacuum (10 - 6 - 10 - 3 Torr).

40|$|Due to {{specific}} process parameters such as very low {{pressure in the}} furnace chamber and high local superheating of the melt during electron beam cold hearth melting uncontrolled evaporation losses of alloying elements such as chromium in superalloys and aluminium in titanium alloys take place. During the present development two different routes were followed to solve these problems: 1. covering the melt surface with an oxid slag, so that the energy was introduced into the melt indirectly through the slag cover. 2. development of a high frequency <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>gun</b> with 1200 Hz as against 100 Hz to 150 Hz usually. Accordingly, the local dwelling time of the electron beam could be reduced from 7 msec to 0, 8 msec. During melting of the superalloy Inconel 718 by covering the melt surface with a CaO/Al_ 2 O_ 3 -slag and by using the newly developed high frequency <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>gun</b> the evaporation losses of chromium were reduced from 2. 5 % to 0. 34 %. The melts of the Ti-alloy Ti_ 6 Al_ 4 V could not be covered with an oxide slag due to heavy reactions between the melt and the slag. The test melts were therefore carried out with the newly developed <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>gun</b> with a frequency of 1200 Hz. Also {{in this case the}} Al-loss could be reduced from 13. 5 % at 100 Hz to 6. 1 % at 1200 Hz.
