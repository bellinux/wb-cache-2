However, if for services or tangible assets, the comparison of the transfer price to the market one is relatively easy to achieve, for the intangible ones, quantifying future benefits waived by the affiliated person compared to the situation in which it would be independent is harder to be established. ...|$|R

The paper preliminarily explains the pattern of business ties in Japan and overviews their history. There existed a kind of conglomerate called zaibatsu and there exist three types of business ties in Japanese economic society: corporate group, business complex and keiretsu. This paper concentrates on the corporate group. A corporate group is a pattern of business ties in which a core (parent) company and its subsidiaries form a business group. Japanese established manufacturers actually extended their businesses as corporate groups. This paper first explains how they succeeded internationally as a corporate group. They produced and sold the goods efficiently and effectively with the advantage of <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions,</b> and they accumulated profits on the core companies' accounts. Afterwards it discusses the effect of globalization and the Japanese Accounting Big Bang on the management of corporate groups.

These effects put pressure on the Japanese manufacturers to change their strategies...|$|R

As to the management, many are arguing that the one-tier-board obliged in Belgium is no longer realistic and that, as such, the way should be cleared for a two-tier-board management structure. Moreover, the responsibility of the managers should be sharpened, by obliging them to pinpoint a representative in case the manager would be an artificial person.

40|$|Under IAS 24 {{a related}} party {{transaction}} (RPT) is a ‘transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, {{regardless of whether}} a price is charged’ (IASB 2009). In particular, it refers to those transactions that the firm engages with its subsidiaries, parent company, associates, managers, directors and majority shareholders, {{as well as their}} close relatives. The academic literature suggests at least three perspectives to interpret these transactions: (1) the conflict of interest perspective, considering the RPTs as potentially harmful for corporate outsiders (minority shareholders and creditors), (2) the efficient transactions perspective, for which RPTs may benefit the firm and its outsiders, (3) the contingencies perspective, arguing {{that it can not be}} said a priori that RPTs are harmful or efficient, as this would depend on the organizational context and institutional environment where such transactions are concluded. Following the contingency perspective and supported by the literature review, the article proposes to consider the interest of the business group and the directing activity of parent company for the interpretation of RPTs. Considering the interest of the group means interpreting <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> not as isolated transactions, as usually done by empirical studies, but in a wider perspective: that of the group. A multiple case study analyses on three Italian pyramidal groups will be presented in order to show how and why the interest of the group and the directing activity of parent company are important in the interpretation of RPTs...|$|R
40|$|Groups of {{companies}} {{have become the}} prevailing form of European large-sized firms. Differently from the German law regarding this subject, that developed a global and autonomous set of rules, according to the principles drafted at the European level, the Italian company law has chosen to develop only specific rules about groups {{of companies}}, especially oriented (i) to prevent {{the risk that the}} parent company could carry out the activity of management and co-ordination of the group in its own interest, or in the interest of another business and in violation of the one of the subsidiaries and, in any case, (ii) to restore the damages suffered by the minority shareholders of the latter depending on an unfair exercise of this power of control and management. In this work the Author underlines that the Italian rules, introduced in 2003, have to be considered a good starting point in the perspective of the protection of minority shareholders against <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> that could harm the value of their investment, although they are not completely satisfactory. The aim of the Italian law is, indeed, oriented only to protect the mi- nority shareholders of the subsidiary companies, forgetting that the same need of protection exists with regards to the minority shareholders of the parent company, who could be harmed in the same way through this type of transaction.

The economic unit concept refers {{to a group of}} companies that are collectively integrated on a financial, an organisational or an economic basis by virtue of common control, so that they are working towards a common purpose or goal. The South African income tax dispensation currently makes no provision for group taxation. Each legal entity within a group is taxed as a separate taxpayer. This study aims to evaluate whether {{there is a need for}} a system of group taxation in South Africa. In order to do so, the definition of a group was considered, the different tax treatment of divisions as opposed to a group structure were investigated, the current income tax dispensation for inter-group transactions was analysed, and anomalies arising from that were highlighted. The recommendations of the Katz Commission in its Third Interim Report, which addressed the issue of group taxation, were also examined to determine whether the report supports the implementation of a system of group taxation in South Africa. The impact of a system of group taxation for meeting the requirements of the canons of taxation, as well as the implications for the fiscus and the taxpayer, were also examined.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{transfer}} pricing arises where companies are divisionalised and have responsibility centres operating as strategic business units. This {{kind of situation}} {{is associated with the}} challenge of determining suitable prices for <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions.</b> The transfer pricing problem becomes even more critical where a company has subsidiaries spread around the world especially in countries that have varying tax rates. Under this situation, it is common for multinational companies to attempt to minimise their tax liabilities by shifting profits from higher tax countries to lower tax regimes. Of course tax authorities {{all over the world are}} not comfortable with this kind of arrangement. Thus efforts are being made like what the FIRS is doing in Nigeria to stop it. The issue of transfer pricing as it relates to financial reporting is usually associated with uncertain tax positions in terms of the extent to which tax reserves may need to be recorded due to uncertainty with respect to tax return position. Transfer pricing has income tax consequences which of course, is more pronounced when the parties to a transaction are taxed in different jurisdictions. So it is really a problem for multinational companies and governments all over the world. Therefore, this study was carried out to examine the impact of transfer pricing on financial reporting. And it was gathered that governments and multinational companies in Nigerian and those of other developing countries world over are constrained by the required resources to be able to effectively implement transfer pricing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that appropriate transfer prices be established for intra-group and/or intra-firm transfer of goods, intangibles and services...|$|R

This is why, in the last decades, the MNEs granted special attention to business structures and put significant efforts in business restructurings, where the case, with the scope to keep the efficiency and to remain on the market. Generally, the operational business restructuring process follows one of the business model globally developed, namely manufacturer or sales business models. Thus, according to the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed, the entities within the group are labeled into limited risk units (such as toll manufacturer or commission agent), medium risk (contract manufacturer, commissionaire, stripped distributor) or high risk units (fully fledged manufacturer, fully fledged distributor). Notwithstanding the above, there should be emphasized that the operational business restructuring has to be undertaken with maximal care, as it might have important fiscal impact.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to explain and analyze whether today’s {{existing}} regulations provide sufficient guidance on how to apply the Profit Split Method (PSM) in practice. Since the enterprises’ profits arising from <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> increases, the tax base for any government also becomes larger and more important. This issue will likely become even more problematic as the globalization branches out {{and the majority of}} the global trade is undertaken between associated enterprises. In order to satisfy all parts and serve the dual objective of securing an appropriate tax base in each jurisdiction and avoiding double taxation, one ambition of the OECD is to harmonize the transfer pricing rules and make them become more uniform. An area in which this goal can be accomplish is at an international level such as the OECD; an important developer in the field of transfer pricing. Different transfer pricing methods has been developed which can be applied by both taxpayers and tax authorities to determine a correct transfer price. Six of these methods has gained international acceptance, although to a more or less extent among various countries, and one of these methods is the PSM. In the years between 1979 and 1995, the OECD had a reluctant standpoint of accepting the application of any transfer pricing method based on profits, such as the PSM. This hesitant viewpoint changed in the existing TPG which explicitly stipulates that the PSM could provide a transfer pricing estimation in accordance with the ALP, which should be accepted in exceptional cases. There are certain situations where a PSM possibly will provide the most appropriate arm’s length result. Since the principle of economics can create complex business environments of both vertical and horizontal integration, contributions of valuable intangibles {{on both sides of the}} cross-border transaction, the PSM might be the only method which can be employed. A relevant issue which need to be enlightened is whether the existing guidance provided by the OECD and USA is sufficient from a practitioners and tax administration point of view, or is more guidance needed to better understand the issues surrounding the concept of the PSM. The fact that OECD insist of using comparables to the highest extent as possible when employing the PSM entails practical problems, since it is rather a rule than an exception that reliable comparables cannot be found when valuable intangibles are involved. The Arthur of this master’s thesis has identified three key conclusions which might facilitate how PSM issues can be handled in the future and improve the existing PSM guidance. These conclusions are the need for a uniform PSM interpretation, the need for additional flexibility and acceptance, and the need for additional TPG guidance...|$|R

The group also provides its customers with turnkey deliveries, which are when the supplier has the overall responsibility for the delivery of a marine foodservice area. Marine Food group transfers goods and services between the enterprises situated in Finland, Sweden and the US and has not established a transfer pricing system for these transactions. The company located in Singapore was recently established and any <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> have not been conducted yet. This master’s thesis aims at developing a transfer pricing system that could be applicable on these transactions and acceptable to the tax authorities in Finland, Sweden and the US. The elements that should be included when developing a transfer pricing system is functional analysis, economic analysis, an analysis of transactions, selection of transfer pricing method and comparables. The Marine Food group is therefore analyzed based on these elements {{in order to be}} successful in developing a transfer pricing system. Furthermore, the transfer pricing rules in Finland, Sweden and USA is examined in order to develop a transfer pricing system that is acceptable to the tax authority in respective country. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are another significant source that are examined when establishing a transfer pricing system for Marine Food group. Spare parts are transferred between the Swedish company, Marine Food AB and the US based company, Marine Food LLC. The transfer pricing method that should be applied in Sweden is the resale price method since Marine Food LLC operates like a reseller for the spare parts. Internal comparables exist and comparability for the purposes of resale price method can be established with reference to both internal and external data. In the US, the comparable profit method should be applied given that it meets the best method rule. The transactions from the Finnish Company, Marine Food Oy and the Swedish company, Marine Food AB consist of installation works and stainless steel furniture. Hence, the transactions both involve goods and services and should be looked at separately. The transfer price for the installation works should be set by using the transactional net margin method. In order to determine the transfer price under the transactional net margin method both internal and external comparables can be used in this case. The transfer price for the stainless steel furniture should on the other hand be established using the resale price method. In order to determine comparability external comparables are used due to lack of internal data. Marine Food AB sells galley equipment and spare parts to Marine Food Oy. The transfer pricing method that should be applied on these transactions is the resale price method since the least complex party in the transaction, Marine Food Oy, act like a reseller of the galley equipment and spare parts.

40|$|Transfer pricing can be {{described}} as the internal price setting between multinational group companies. In recent years the issue of jurisdiction’s tax revenue flowing out of the jurisdiction has been closely related with transfer pricing and the tax authorities all over the world have increasingly began to question the arm’s length nature of the <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> of multinational enterprises. In this thesis {{the focus is on the}} transfer pricing issues arising in situations where intangible assets are involved in business restructuring. Multinational enterprises have noticed that in this time of global recession and economic uncertainty in order for them to be able to answer the invariably increasing competition on the global markets the need to restructure their functions, assets, and risks in a way that will rationalize their operations and reduce the related costs. Intangible assets are often the items being transferred to low-cost / low-tax jurisdictions as they are easily transferrable due to their nature. However, intangible assets are commonly also those, which cause the most controversy between tax payers and tax administrations because they are difficult to identify as well as it is difficult to determine the appropriate arm’s length compensation for them. The research questions in this thesis include the question of how intangible assets are defined and who is the owner of the intangible for transfer purposes. Even though it might sound simple, these factors are often difficult to determine, and different countries might have different interpretations even though the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines are quite unanimously accepted at least among the OECD Member Countries as leading guidance in the area. The possible inadequate determination of ownership or failure to recognize a certain item as a compensable intangible asset may lead to transfer pricing adjustment by the tax authorities and possible penalties. It may also lead to double taxation especially in the case of jurisdictions disagreeing on the right characterisation of the item or the rightful owner. The main research questions of this thesis are what type of issues generally arise regarding to transfer pricing of intangibles in business restructuring situations and how different (OECD) jurisdictions treat these situations. Issues relating to back-to-back transactions and treatment of business synergies and location savings, which are common in centralization of intangible property, are examined. Also the issues related to transferring intangible assets with no established value are focused on. An issue which is especially closely related to the back-to-back transactions is the recognition or actually the non-recognition of the actual transactions taken by the taxpayer. The research questions the thesis aims at answering are thus also, in what situations should the tax authorities have grounds for restructuring the transaction instead of a pricing adjustment, what are the approaches of various OECD countries to restructuring transactions and what is the relationship of the restructuring according to Art 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention to domestic anti-avoidance provisions. Finally, as it is established that the risk of transfer pricing disputes in the area of intangible assets and business restructurings exists, the preventative measures and measures for resolution of such disputes should be available to mitigate the risk. However, the conclusion that was reached in this thesis is that there is still a lot more room for improvement in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, changes in market {{conditions}} such as globalisation and deregulation of financial markets as well as product innovation and technical advancements have induced financial institutions to expand their business activities beyond their traditional boundaries and to engage in cross-sectoral operations. As combining different sectoral businesses offers opportunities for operational synergies and diversification benefits, financial groups comprising banks, insurance undertakings and/or investment firms, usually referred to as financial conglomerates, have rapidly emerged, providing {{a wide range of}} services and products in distinct financial sectors and oftentimes in different geographic locations. In the European Union (EU), financial conglomerates have become part of the biggest and most active financial market participants in recent years. Financial conglomerates generally pose new problems for financial authorities as they can raise new risks and exacerbate existing ones. In particular, their cross-sectoral business activities can involve prudentially substantial risks such as the risk of regulatory arbitrage and contagion risk arising from <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions.</b> Moreover, the generally large size of financial conglomerates as well as the high complexity and interconnectedness of their corporate structures and risk exposures can entail substantial systemic risk and can therefore threaten the stability of the financial system as a whole. Until a few years ago, there was no supervisory framework in place which addressed a financial conglomerate in its entirety as a group. Instead, each group entity within a financial conglomerate was subject to the supervisory rules of its pertinent sector only. Such silo supervisory approach had the drawback of not taking account of risks which arise or aggravate at the group level. It also failed to consider how the risks from different business lines within the group interrelate with each other and affect the group as a whole. In order to address this lack of group-wide prudential supervision of financial conglomerates, the European legislator adopted the Financial Conglomerates Directive 2002 / 87 /EC 8 (‘FCD’) on 16 December 2002. The FCD was transposed into national law in the member states of the EU (‘Member States’) by 11 August 2004 for application to financial years beginning on 1 January 2005 and after. The FCD primarily aims at supplementing the existing sectoral directives to address the additional risks of concentration, contagion and complexity presented by financial conglomerates. It therefore provides for a supervisory framework which is applicable in addition to the sectoral supervision. Most importantly, the FCD has introduced additional capital requirements at the conglomerate level so as to prevent the multiple use of the same capital by different group entities. This paper seeks to examine to what extent the FCD provides for an adequate capital regulation of financial conglomerates in the EU while taking into account the underlying sectoral capital requirements and the inherent risks associated with financial conglomerates. In Part 1, the definition and the basic corporate models of financial conglomerates will be presented (I), followed by an illustration of the core motives behind the phenomenon of financial conglomeration (II) and an overview of the development of the supervision over financial conglomerates in the EU (III). Part 2 begins with a brief elaboration on the role of regulatory capital (I) and gives a general overview of the EU capital requirements applicable to banks and insurance undertakings respectively. A delineation of the commonalities and differences of the banking and the insurance capital requirements will be provided (II). It continues to further examine the need for a group-wide capital regulation of financial conglomerates and analyses the adequacy of the FCD capital requirements. In this context, the technical advice rendered by the Joint Committee on Financial Conglomerates (JCFC) as well as the currently ongoing legislative reforms at the EU level will be discussed (III). The paper finally closes with a conclusion and an outlook on remaining open issues (IV) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{was assumed}} {{in the mid}} 1990 s that 60 % of all global trade took place within a group of enterprises. With {{increased}} globalisation leading {{to an increase in}} mergers and acquisitions this figure is most likely higher. Thus intra-company and <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> form a major part of business. These transactions, due to the association between the enterprises, may not always reflect the conditions that a market with independent actors would dictate. There are various reasons for this, which include not only tax considerations but also difficulties in establishing conditions that reflect those that inde-pendent companies would apply, in other words conditions in accordance with the arm’s length principle. In cases where these conditions are not in accordance with what the state considers as an arm’s length price, the profits of the enterprise located in that state may be adjusted for taxation purposes under transfer pricing provisions. The complexity of transfer pricing rules and the various methods for establishing an arm’s length price result in different interpretations and increased uncertainty for multinational enterprises that often face different rules for determining a correct transfer price. Therefore, enterprises may often face transfer pricing adjustments of their profits due to the complexity and differences in transfer pricing legislation. Transfer pricing adjustments potentially lead to unresolved double taxation, in fact business reports have indicated that 42 % of the transfer pricing adjustments lead to double taxation. Therefore it is imperative to have legal mechanisms that resolve potential double taxation. The Convention on the Elimination of Double Taxation in Connection with the Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises (Arbitration Convention) was adopted to give the multinational enterprises, facing double taxation due to adjustments of their profits, a remedy that obliged the states to resolve the double taxation. This was the first, and is still the only, EC-wide mechanism that technically guarantees that transfer pricing double taxation is resolved and thus holds a great improvement over other existing mechanisms to resolve double taxation. The Arbitration Convention was originally a proposed EC Directive but was transformed into a intergovernmental convention. This has resulted in that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has no jurisdiction to interpret the Arbitration Convention or its application. Furthermore there is no supranational or international organ that could take action against states that interpret or apply the Conven-tion in an unintended manner. The chosen legal form has also resulted in different interpretations as to what status the Arbitration Convention has compared to bilateral tax conventions, and thus whether it precedes them. This could prove troublesome when future bilateral treaties are concluded or where there already exist tax treaties that have different solutions to transfer pricing related double taxation. The risk of the Convention being interpreted differently is greatly increased by the various undefined terms and lack of precise provisions in the Convention. Therefore, the Convention has been subject to an inconsistent application and interpretation from the date it came into effect in 1995. The Convention was only given a five year life span, after which it was destined to be renewed if the contracting states so expressed, involving the same ratification process as at the initial acceptation of the Convention. However, as this was inefficient, a Prolongation Protocol was signed to amend the Convention with an automatic extension of its life. As it took till 2004 for this Protocol to be ratified and finally enter into force on 1 November 2004 it created one of the main interpretation and application differences {{in the life of the}} Convention. The function of the Convention’s procedures and thus its efficiency in resolving double taxation is impeded by the numerous interpretation differences and lack of precise pro-visions in the Convention. The fact that there is no way to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are precisely followed, partly since there are uncertainties regarding the precise interpretation but also partly since there is no organ that could enforce a uniform application of the Convention, further impedes the efficiency of the Convention, which is clearly seen in practice. Another question of interpretation and application raised is that, although the Convention was originally intended as a means for resolving transfer pricing related double taxation, there have been arguments that the Convention could apply to double taxation due to provisions concerning thin capitalisation as well. These provisions bring about similar conditions as those the Convention requires for its applicability and, although a different area of law, the connections in the conditions are many and undeniable...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} continuity {{and change in}} the development of financial-industrial groups (FIGs) in Russia. FIGs usually embrace one or several banks and one or several industrial enterprises. Looking at how Russian enterprises are transformed into FIGs, I focus on the process of reforming systems of control and incentives over savings and investment decisions. In the Soviet era, after 1973, enterprises and production associations were under the control of ministries or so-called industrial associations. At that time, production associations were recognized as legitimate industrial groups, but there were no FIGs. But under the power of Gorbachev, he decided to open brand-new businesses, which meant the first step to the market economy. On June 30, 1987, the Soviet law concerning governmental enterprises was enacted to introduce a self-financing system for enterprises and production associations. This new self-financing system enlarged power of enterprise managers in the decision-making, but it did not basically change the old system of control over the industry. Branch ministries and other hierarchical structures still existed exerting a strong pressure on enterprises. The law alleviating them was enacted in July 17 1987. On August 3, 1989, the Soviet law concerning the introduction of amendments and additions of governmental enterprises law was enacted. It added a 7 th clause to the 5 th article, which stated that enterprises, associations and organizations could establish concerns, consortiums, inter-sector governmental associations and governmental production associations on the basis of contracts. This both confirmed the existence of, and gave official sanction to the newly established industrial groups. Some Russian economists have claimed that establishing of these groups was merely a change in signboards. Ministries kept enjoying enough power and control over enterprise policies. Staff of ministries tried to keep their rights and interests by pretending to follow new economic policies. Their powers were so strong that they could maintain their positions and promulgate a new law about Soviet-enterprises which was enacted in June 4, 1990. After the election of the Russian republic of the USSR in March 1990, radical reformers gained a majority in parliament. Following this, the law concerning privatization of governmental and autonomous enterprises was enacted. The 4 th clause of the 8 th article in this law decreed that holding companies could be established by enterprises of associations. This showed that the Russian government did attempt to change concerns, consortiums, inter-sector governmental associations and governmental production associations into joint stock companies under control of holding companies. By keeping corporate grouping, the staff of those groups could maintain their powers throughout the process of privatization. The defeat of the August 1991 putsch of communist hard-liners accelerated the shift to capitalism. The decree of the Russian president on November 16, 1992 approved of measures governing holding companies activities {{at the time of the}} privatization of governmental enterprises into joint stock companies. According to these measures, 10 holding companies such as Gazprom, Russian United energy system, YuKOS and so on were authorized to do business. Moreover, Gazprom developed into a FIG by establishing private banks such as Gazprombank and acquiring a share of the Imperial Bank. On the other hand, leaders of military industries, which were confronted with economic difficulties after the collapse of the USSR, planned to introduce officially registered FIGs in order to receive assistance from the government. Their lobbying efforts resulted in a Presidential Decree, of December 5 1993, allowing so called "official FIGs". Examining the history of how control in the industry has been transformed, one can conclude that the observed changes have resulted from lobbying activities of old managers and politicians. But why they tried to establish FIGs? One of the reasons is that they wanted to keep their power. But another important factor was to keep investment funds within the groups. On the process of the reform of the industrial system, the government tried to decrease subsidies to enterprises, forcing them to earn more themselves. The Soviet law concerning governmental enterprises on June 30 1987 decided to abolish united fund for development of science and technology on the level of industrial ministries in order to keep a lot of investment resources on the level of enterprises. But the system of paying some profits to upper class organization was not changed. Therefore, at this time the self-financing system was imperfect. In the case of concerns, they kept concentrated financial funds by collecting profits from their participants. This means that one of the purposes of establishing concerns was to mobilize funds as before. On the other hand, FIGs were instrumental for accumulating investment resources in their own banks. Often they established their own banks (sometimes called "pocket banks") to be used for <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions,</b> for keeping the liquidity and for mobilizing investment resources. For example, the Radio Ministry of the USSR had established Promradtekhbank in 1990. State concern, Norilisk Nikel Metallurgy Complez, which became one of the members of an official FIG (Interros). Of course, several FIGs were led by newly established banks such as ONEKSIMbank, which was established after the collapse of the USSR. But SBS-Agro, Alfa Bank, Most Bank, which established FIGs, were developed by the founders of cooperatives, which were established after the Gorbachev's economic policy. Therefore, I come to conclusion that ignoring continuity in Russian corporate development one cannot correctly understand the evolution of Financial-Industrial Groups...|$|R
