5000|$|In {{regards to}} civil {{response}} to {{the actions of the}} French, William Wordsworth's poem Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland was directly inspired by the events of the Stecklikrieg. His poetry of the period was his {{response to the}} [...] "easy jingoism" [...] which he considered to often captivate the British populace. In the Subjugation of Switzerland, he relates his experiences on the differences between the [...] "place" [...] of a nation and the [...] "politics" [...] of one. He saw the French intervention in Switzerland as a repudiation of the philosophy of the Revolution and supported the British <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> the war against France, though he did still sympathize with the values initially claimed by the French Revolution.|$|R

Starting from our direct-style transformer towards pure, call-by-value functional terms (Scheme), we extend it with an analysis to detect non-canonical occurrences <b>of</b> a <b>continuation.</b> The <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> such a <b>continuation</b> is translated into a control operator, and its application into an activation of the corresponding first-class continuation. The direct-style and the continuation-passing style transformations {{have a place in}} the programmer 's toolbox. They enlarge the class of programs that can be manipulated on a semantic basis. We illustrate this point with partial evaluation, by specializing a Scheme program with respect to a static part of its input. The program uses coroutines.

Starting from our DS transformer towards pure, call-byvalue functional terms (Scheme), we extend it with a counting analysis to detect non-canonical occurrences <b>of</b> a <b>continuation.</b> The <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> such a <b>continuation</b> is translated into a call/cc and its application into the application of the corresponding first-class continuation.

50|$|When a regent {{is removed}} from office by a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> {{incapacity}} and subsequently the incapacity ceases to exist, the regent can be restored to office by means <b>of</b> a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity. In that case upon the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with {{the person who has}} a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign.|$|R
