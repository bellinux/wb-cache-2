Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip.

5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> {{to equip}} his army with guns, turrets, {{vehicles}} and explosives, but still needed more. He {{was approached by}} an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante {{when he had the}} gold, which he would use to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante to take over the excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sully find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting.Guerro wounds Chase badly before being thrown off a bridge by Nate.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, after 2 {{years of}} cycle racing, working and saving, Adolphe <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> {{to start in}} {{business}}, so he opened a bicycle repair works in Bordeaux, aged 21. The next stage of his business plan was to move to Marseille where {{he learned how to}} manufacture steel tubes for bicycles.

25|$|Caesar {{was already}} in Crassus' {{political}} debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate ("rule of three men"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia.

25|$|Heine now had {{to search}} for a job. He was only really suited to writing but it was {{extremely}} difficult to be a professional writer in Germany. The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to cover his expenses. Before finding work, Heine visited the North Sea resort of Norderney which inspired the free verse poems of his cycle Die Nordsee.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire invaded northwestern Persia in 1914. Before {{the end of}} 1914, Turkish and Kurdish {{troops had}} {{successfully}} entered the villages in and around Urmia. On February 21, 1915 the Turkish army in Urmia seized 61 leading Assyrians from the French missions as hostages, demanding large ransoms. The mission <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to convince the Ottomans to let 20 of the men go. However, on February 22 the remaining 41 were executed, having their heads cut off at the stairs of the Charbachsh Gate. The dead included bishop Mar Denkha.|$|E

He traded his 1957 Chevy for a truck and race hauler. After arriving in Tennessee, he tore up the car in qualifying at Newport Speedway. He worked for his father until he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to repair the car. He won some races, earning just enough money to continue racing.|$|E

25|$|Following the marriage, Tudor {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, which was based at Lydd, Kent, England. Larissa was ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and spinal caries {{and was unable to}} sit up straight. She spent her days reclining in an elongated bath chair. The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing in the garden of their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars and he had no personal fortune, he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to pay for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{was already}} in Crassus' {{political}} debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey, who was unsuccessfully fighting the Senate for ratification of his eastern settlements and farmland for his veterans. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds since they were consuls together in 70 BC, and Caesar knew if he allied himself with one he would lose {{the support of the}} other, so he endeavoured to reconcile them. Between the three of them, they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (rule of three men), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who was elected to the consulship for the following year.|$|E
25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. The brilliance of the CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|E

25|$|Phar Lap at {{the time}} was owned by American {{businessman}} David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap's strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} at Hamilton, Lord's growing disaffection with college life caused him to {{suddenly}} move to Canada with a friend, where he became editor-in-chief of a national newspaper, The Canadian. After just one year in that position, he decided {{to move back to}} the United States and specifically Buffalo. In his diary, he cites finances as a reason; indeed, when he arrived in Buffalo, he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> for just a single meal and only one night's stay in a hotel. Almost immediately after his arrival, he was hired by the law firm of Love & Tracy, then the preeminent lawyers of western New York. He quickly became a popular figure, and well respected by Buffalo society, and was chosen to represent the city in the United States semi-centennial celebrations. In 1825, at Buffalo's quarter-century celebrations, he was also chosen to speak, in which he recounted the more colorful side of Buffalo's history, recalling a panther killed in the street, the city's vicious rivalry with nearby Black Rock during its village years, and the construction of the Erie Canal.|$|E

They assembled twelve couples who were interested not only in demanding physical labor but also in a life of the mind, {{but none of them}} <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> to embark on the project, which required much capital.
