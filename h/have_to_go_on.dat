5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet 1st and 3rd Guard Armies, in {{conjunction}} with the Soviet 6th Army, launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Despite early troubles due to stubborn resistance from Italian troops, the Red Army was able to partially overrun the Italian 8th Army by 18 December. The breakthrough -even if small and quickly contained- proved a possible threat to Army Group Don's left flank, while the city of Rostov was threatened by the 3rd Guards Army. This, and mainly heavy losses sustained by the German armor divisions forcing their way to the Myshkova river, forced Manstein to reconsider continuing the offensive. The German field marshal decided that he could not defend his left flank while also sustaining the attempt to relieve the 6th Army. Although the 6th Panzer Division was able to cross the Myshkova River by the night of 19 December, the LVII Panzer Corps had still not made major advances against increased Soviet opposition, despite the arrival of the 17th Panzer Division; in fact, {{it seemed as if the}} corps would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the defensive. Furthermore, the Soviet raid on Tatsinskaya managed to destroy the airfield and several dozen aircraft being used by the Luftwaffe to resupply forces inside the Stalingrad pocket, forcing Manstein to order the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the defensive, instead of reserving it to bolster his forces directed toward the breakthrough to Stalingrad. To make matters worse for the Germans, on 18 December Hitler refused to allow the German 6th Army to begin a breakout operation towards the rest of Army Group Don, despite pleas from Manstein.|$|E

25|$|Operation Accolade, {{called for}} a direct attack on Rhodes and Karpathos, with three {{infantry}} divisions, an armored brigade, and support units. Landings at Crete, which was too well fortified and had a strong German garrison, were dropped. The main problem faced by the planners was the difficulty of countering Fliegerkorps X of the Luftwaffe {{because of a lack}} of air cover, since the American and British aircraft were based in Cyprus and the Middle East. This challenge was further exacerbated by the demands of the upcoming Allied invasion of Sicily. The Americans were skeptical about the operation, which they regarded as aiming mostly at post-war political benefits for Britain and an unnecessary diversion from the Italian campaign. They refused to support it, warning the British that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> alone.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. [...] In {{his first}} event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol {{surprised}} many after {{he failed to}} make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. [...] Peirsol said, [...] "I thought I was going faster. [...] I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> pick myself up and focus on my next events." [...] But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Jay-Z {{released}} his twelfth studio album Magna Carta... Holy Grail, {{in an interview}} he revealed that two songs on the album were initially recorded for Watch the Throne, the song [...] "Oceans" [...] which features Frank Ocean and the song [...] "Holy Grail" [...] which went on to feature Justin Timberlake (Although Timberlake's contribution to the track was not anticipated at the time, until the duo collaborated on Timberlake's 2013 comeback single [...] "Suit & Tie" [...] and [...] "Murder" [...] from The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2 respectively). West and Jay-Z argued for four days about having them included on the Watch the Throne, however West eventually relented and the duo recorded [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". In an interview with Zane Lowe, Jay-Z said: [...] " [...] no lyrics on 'Holy Grail' and I recorded 'Oceans' and I played those records for Kanye," [...] Jay explained. [...] "And he was like, 'No those <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> Watch the Throne,' so we spent four days arguing about those records and I was explaining to him why it wasn't right for this project and I had a whole idea for making this album called Magna Carta...

2500|$|Not all city economies were {{controlled}} by guilds; some cities were [...] "free." [...] Where guilds were in control, they shaped labor, production and trade; they had strong controls over instructional capital, {{and the modern}} concepts of a lifetime progression of apprentice to craftsman, and then from journeyman eventually to widely recognized master and grandmaster began to emerge. In order to become a Master, a Journeyman would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a three-year voyage called Journeyman years.

2500|$|The 2006 {{photographs}} and footage {{led to a}} number of websites labelling Daher the [...] "Green Helmet", in reference to his distinctive headgear, and accusing him of being a member of Hezbollah and of using bodies for propaganda purposes. One website published a video that it asserted showed Daher arranging for a child's body to be taken off an ambulance to be displayed for photographers. British author Richard North asserted that Daher had taken control of the scene [...] "to orchestrate false photo opportunities with the dead bodies". North later admitted to Jefferson Morley of the Washington Post that he had no evidence that Daher was connected to Hezbollah and, as he put it, [...] "All I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> is gut instinct." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do that to us we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon and McCartney {{introduced}} {{their new}} business concept on {{a press conference}} held on 14 May 1968 in New York City, with McCartney saying it would be, [...] "A beautiful {{place where you can}} buy beautiful things… a controlled weirdness… a kind of Western communism". Lennon said, [...] "It's a company we're setting up, involving records, films, and electronics, and – as a sideline – manufacturing or whatever. We want to set up a system where people who just want to make a film about anything, don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> their knees in somebody's office, probably yours". McCartney also said: [...] "It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment. We're in the happy position of not needing any more money. So for the first time, the bosses aren't in it for profit. We've already bought all our dreams. We want to share that possibility with others".|$|E

[...] "When the pictures of the '65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting {{to be the first to}} show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer." [...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots— zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes— until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist... The '65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn't go fast enough, but we love it." ...|$|E
