However, raw lignocellulosic biomass presents several undesired properties such as low energy density, hygroscopic nature, and low bulk density that do not permit its direct exploitation. Torrefaction, an emerging thermal pretreatment process, is acknowledged to improve the fuel properties of raw biomass towards an efficient renewable energy supply. This paper investigates the fuel characteristics of OPF and OPT at temperatures: 200 ˚C, 250 ˚C, and 300 ˚C at a constant heating rate of 10 ˚C/min and 30 min residence time.

In this study, palm shell being one of the abundant biomass in Malaysia, was used together with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as precursors for the preparation of porous carbons via microwave induced potassium carbonate chemical activation. The porous carbons were investigated as potential sorbents for high temperature CO 2 capture and methane storage. Design expert software version 7. 1. 6. using central composite design coupled with surface response methodology was used in predicting and optimization of the preparation conditions of the porous carbons for CO 2 capture. Effects of microwave power, amount of PEEK and irradiation time on the sorbent performance for CO 2 adsorption were investigated. The characteristics of the porous carbons were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, pH, thermogravimetric and <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, proximate and ultimate analysis. The ideal CO 2 adsorption capacities of porous carbons were determined using volumetric method at temperatures of 30 oC, 70 oC, 105 oC and 170 oC and pressures of 1 - 4 bar, while methane (CH 4) adsorption was tested only at 30 oC. Microwave power was found to be the most significant factor influencing the porous carbon for CO 2 adsorption. The optimum conditions were microwave power of 500 W, irradiation time of 6. 89 min and amount of PEEK 21. 91 %. Highest CO 2 uptake of 2. 97 mmol CO 2 adsorbed/g adsorbent was achieved by M 4 P 2 (400 W of microwave power, 6 min irradiation time and 20 % amount of PEEK) among the sorbents at 30 oC and 1 bar. Highest CH 4 uptake of 1. 144 mmol CH 4 adsorbed/g adsorbent was also recorded by M 4 P 0 (400 W of microwave power, 6 min irradiation time and 0 % amount of PEEK) sorbent at 30 oC and 1 bar. The CO 2 equilibrium data correlated well with Sips isotherms. In all scenarios studied, increase in temperature led to a decrease in CO 2 adsorption while increase in pressure led to an increase in CO 2 adsorption. The sorbents remained stable after seven CO 2 adsorption/regeneration cycles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{investigate}} the effect of the cellulose content on the synthesis of cellulose/SrF 2 nanocomposites, which were successfully synthesized by the microwave-assisted method at 100 degrees C for 20 min. These nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> (TG), and <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> (DTG). In addition to this, this synthetic route was also extended to fabricate the other cellulose/alkaline earth metal fluorides (MF 2, M = Ca, Mg, Ba) nanocomposites. What&# 39;s more, the influence of cellulose/alkaline earth metal fluorides (MF 2, M = Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) nanocomposites on the tensile properties of paper were also explored. The cellulose content is found to have a certain influence on the morphology, crystal lattice, crystallinity and thermostability of alkaline earth metal fluorides.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> {{was carried}} out to {{investigate}} the thermal decomposition behavior of a commercial fire retarded (FR) and a non-fire retarded (NFR) flexible polyurethane foam. The effects of the heating rate and the reaction atmosphere on the thermal decomposition process were studied at three different heating rates ranging from 5 °C/min to 20 °C/min in both nitrogen and air environment. Results from the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF SIMS) study revealed that the additives in the FR foam were phosphorus and brominated compounds. The measurements by means of colorimetric method further certified that the concentrations of phos-phorus and bromine in the FR foam sample were 0. 08 wt % and 1. 4 wt % respec-tively. From the thermogravimetric (TG) and the <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> (DTG) curves, it was seen that the thermal decomposition processes of both the FR and the NFR foams followed a two-step reaction in nitrogen. However, the thermal decomposition processes followed a three-step reaction in air. The thermal analysis {{results showed that the}} flame retardant additives of phos...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} experiments of {{oil shale}} semi-coke from Wang Qing retorts, cornstalk {{as well as}} their mixture were conducted under different heating rates using the thermogravimetric analyzer. The results showed that the advance ignition and burnout can be achieved when semi-coke was mixed with cornstalk. <b>Derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> curve of the experiment was compared with that of the calculated. The values of interaction index were solved. The interaction of mixture in the combustion process occurred mainly in 400 - 600 Â Â°C. It can be explained that the combustion of fixed carbon in cornstalk was delayed. The kinetics of combustion was studied for samples. The activation enthalpy, activation entropy and free energy of activation were analyzed by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose equation and distributed activation energy model based on Eyring rate constant. The free energy of activation decreased with the addition of cornstalk proportion in the mixture. The results showed the feasibility using Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation to simulate thermogravimetric curve. The representation of free energy of activation simulated agrees with that solved by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose equation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a typical prooxidative additive, cobalt stearate, on the thermal stability, degradation kinetics and lifetime of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was investigated using non-isothermal <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> (TGA) in both nitrogen and air atmosphere. The <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> (DTG) curves indicate single stage and multistage decomposition process in nitrogen and air atmosphere respectively. The kinetic parameters of degradation were evaluated using the Flynn–Wall-Ozawa iso-conversion technique. The apparent activation energies for decomposition have been calculated for degradation under nitrogen atmosphere. The lifetime of LDPE (time for 5 % mass loss) {{was estimated to be}} 8. 2 · 1026 min in nitrogen and was found to decrease dramatically with increase in the concentration of cobalt stearate thereby revealing its pro-oxidative ability. Studies indicated that the service/process temperature also has a strong influence on the lifetime of all the formulations investigated. The effect of cobalt stearate on the air oven aging behavior of LDPE at two different temperatures (70 °C and 100 °C) was also investigated to demonstrate the pro-oxidative nature of cobalt stearate...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{and thermal}} stabilizations of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and wood/PVC (WPVC) {{composites}} were studied using lead stearate (PbSt 2), calcium/zinc complex (Ca/Zn) stabilizers, and methyl tin mercaptide (MT). Thermal and structural stabilities of PVC and WPVC composites were assessed using FTIR spectrometer, <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> (TGA) and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The {{results indicated that}} the additions of thermal stabilizers into PVC and WPVC composites could promote the thermal stabilities under both un-aged and thermally aged conditions. The presence of wood particles resulted in increases in polyene and carbonyl sequences during processing and decreases in the decomposition temperature (Td). The presence of wood was found to accelerate the thermal degradation in PVC, and suppressed the efficiencies of the thermal stabilizers used. By increasing the stabilizer dosage, the thermal degradations of PVC and WPVC were moderated. Under thermally aged condition at 177 oC, the additions of thermal stabilizer could decrease the increase in yellowness index (YI) and discoloration at different ageing times. In this work, MT was found to be the most suitable and promising stabilizer for PVC and WPVC composites, considering the polyene and carbonyl contents, Td, the shift of <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> (DTG) curves, and changes in YI value and visual color...|$|R
