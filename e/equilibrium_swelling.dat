The wood swollen in organic liquids in or near the <b>swelling</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> but not that swollen in organic liquids distant from the <b>swelling</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> showed higher moduli of elasticity and rupture than the wood swollen to a similar degree by moisture. This suggests that wood exists in an unstable state as it approaches the <b>swelling</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> rendering it highly flexible and weak. During the first viscoelastic measurements for wood swollen in various organic liquids, thermal softening was observed in 40 °– 60 °C range and above 80 °C, though this softening disappeared during the second measurement. The softening observed in the 40 °– 60 °C range and above 80 °C was thought to have been caused by the redistribution of liquid toward the equilibrium state at a higher temperature and the swelling accompanying an elevated temperature, respectively.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of a silicalite type zeolite on PDMS-zeolite composites. The obtained results show that the introduction of a silicalite type zeolite into polysiloxane matrices results in a change of the <b>equilibrium</b> degree of <b>swelling</b> of the composites in toluene, their hardness and their thermal stability. With increasing amount of zeolite, the time required to achieve the <b>equilibrium</b> degree of <b>swelling</b> (DSe) is reduced, the DSe decreases and the hardness increases.

At zeolite concentrations up to about 12 % there are significant changes of the DSe and the hardness with zeolite concentration, while these effects are considerably less pronounced at higher concentrations. The results obtained show that the silicalite type zeolite acts as a reinforcing filler. We believe that with increasing zeolite concentration in the composite the total number of established polymer-zeolite interactions increases, as does the spatial irregularity of the polymer network, but that the density of the interactions decreases.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{diffusion}} of small solvent molecules (octane) and larger hydrophobic dye probes in octane-swollen poly(dimethyl siloxane) linear-chain solutions and end-linked model networks, using pulsed-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), respectively, focusing on diffusion in the bulk polymer up to the <b>equilibrium</b> degree of <b>swelling</b> of the networks, that is, 4. 8 at most. The combination of these results allows for new conclusions on the feasibility of different theories describing probe diffusion in concentrated polymer systems. While octane diffusion shows no cross-link dependence, the larger dyes are increasingly restricted by fixed chemical meshes. The simple Fujita free-volume theory proved most feasible to describe probe diffusion in linear long-chain solutions with realistic parameters, while better fits were obtained assuming a stretched exponential dependence on concentration. Importantly, we have analyzed the cross-link specific effect on probe diffusion independently of any specific model by comparing the best-fit interpolation of the solution data with the diffusion in the networks. The most reasonable description is obtained by assuming that the cross-link effect is additive in the effective friction coefficient of the probes. The concentration dependences {{as well as the}} data compared at the <b>equilibrium</b> degrees of <b>swelling</b> indicate that swelling heterogeneities and diffusant shape have a substantial influence on small-molecule diffusion in networks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} pH and {{temperature}} on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>swelling</b> properties of PIA/PAAm semi-IPNs were investigated. Semi-IPNs based on polyacrylamide (PAAm) and poly(itaconic acid) (PIA) were prepared by two different techniques, by polymerizing itaconic acid {{in the presence}} of polyacrylamide gel (Semi-IPNs-l) and by making the polyacrylamide gel {{in the presence of}} previously synthesized poly(itaconic acid) (Semi-IPNs-ll), with different PIA/PAAm mass ratios. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>swelling</b> degree of an ionic network depends very much on the concentration of ionisable groups. The addition of a small amount of itaconic acid dramatically changes the swelling behavior of PAAm. Increase of the ionic monomer (IA) produces swelling degrees that increase to a high extent when the pH of the buffer solution is higher than the nominal pKa values of the acid groups. Gels with higher IA content swell less than PAAm gels in low pH buffers. At low pH, when complexation due to hydrogen bonding occurs between the carboxylic groups and amide groups of acrylamide, the polymer network collapses and the swelling ratio is low. The presence of hydrogen bonds in the complexes causes additional constraints in the network, acting as a physical crosslinking and makes the network less hydrophilic, because the carboxylic groups on the PIA are occupied in the complexes. As opposed to this, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>swelling</b> degrees change very little with pH of the solution in nonionic PAAm gel.
