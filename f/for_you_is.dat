5|$|The {{majority}} of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong's works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pig Sty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman's Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong's compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One Day <b>for</b> <b>You),</b> <b>is</b> sung in the background by Eva Huang {{at the end of}} the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang (劉家昌) in the 1970s, it tells of a girl's memories of a loved one, and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.|$|E
25|$|All <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> {{the seventh}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson. Released on April 24, 2001 by Virgin Records America, its development and theme {{was rooted in}} Jackson's separation from husband René Elizondo, Jr, experiencing dating for the first time. Unlike The Velvet Rope, which saw Jackson tackling darker issues such as domestic violence and depression, All for You showcased an upbeat dance-pop sound, incorporating rock, disco, and funk, as well as soft rock and Oriental music. Its lyrics focus on passion, romance, and intercourse, also discussing themes of betrayal and deceit. The explicit language and sexual content of several songs drew media controversy, causing the album to be banned in several countries.|$|E
500|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, {{and gives}} it to the disciples, saying, [...] "This is my body, which is given for you". He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, [...] "This cup that is poured out <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> the new {{covenant}} in my blood" [...] (...) [...] The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events. Although the Gospel of John does not include {{a description of the}} bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that [...] (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.|$|E

They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

Hunter claimed the additions made the video feel more realistic. For the video's primary filming locations, Carey had Louis Vuitton's flagship store on Champs-Élysées, {{one of the most}} prestigious avenues in Paris, shut down. When describing the experience filming in the boutique, Carey explained: [...] "Obviously, being able to take your pick of anything in the store and have the whole store shut down <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> every girl's dream. You know, just a pretty standard {{day in the life of}} anybody. No, just joking. There was a time in my life I only had one pair of shoes, so that's my justification for having that little perk on the job." [...] After filming concluded in France, Snoop Dogg's scenes were filmed on a Sunday in Los Angeles. When asked why Dogg was not present during the Paris shoot, Carey jokingly stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|Generally, Christians {{believe that}} the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper {{as part of the}} Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John {{includes}} the New Commandment.

2500|$|There {{are several}} Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant.

The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as in the statement: [...] "this cup that is poured out <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> the new covenant in my blood".|$|E

2500|$|All for You {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic favored All for You over her last studio album, The Velvet Rope, calling it [...] "alluring, easily enveloping the listener." [...] Erlewine added, [...] "This is her sexiest-sounding record, thanks to Jam and Lewis' silky groove and her breathy delivery, {{two things that}} make the record palatable." [...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a 'B' rating, saying, [...] "Despite a few missteps, All <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> {{about as good as}} modern diva-pop gets, with a higher ratio of worthy-to-mediocre songs than might be expected... it adds up to a lot more than most female singers have done for us lately." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Mulvey of Yahoo! Music noted, [...] "All <b>For</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> {{a concept}} album of sorts, rooted in Jackson's {{traumatic}} separation from husband and collaborator René Elizondo, Jr.. It begins tremendously, {{with a bunch}} of party tracks illustrating a newly-free woman checking out men on the dancefloor. Soon, the action moves to the bedroom, and some amusingly explicit shagging tracks, before a virulent suite detailing what a bastard her ex is. Finally, there's a soppy phase heralding a new life and the prospects of new love." [...] According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, the album is divided into three segments: divorce, industry, and sex. However, MTV News perceived All for You as [...] "dominated by two themes: the liberation that comes with ending a bad relationship, and sex," [...] blending elements of pop, funk, R and rock.|$|E

[...] Other critics labeled Web 2.0 [...] "a second bubble" [...] (referring to the Dot-com bubble of 1997–2000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of business models.

2500|$|Qisas is an Islamic term meaning [...] "retaliation in kind" [...] or revenge, [...] "eye for an eye", [...] "nemesis" [...] or retributive justice. It is a {{category}} of crimes in Islamic jurisprudence, where Sharia allows equal retaliation as the punishment. Qisas principle is available against the accused, to the victim or victim's heirs, when a Muslim is murdered, suffers bodily injury or suffers property damage. In the case of murder, Qisas means {{the right of a}} murder victim's nearest relative or Wali (legal guardian) to, if the court approves, take the life of the killer. The Quran mentions the [...] "eye for an eye" [...] concept as being ordained for the Children of Israel in : [...] "O you who have believed, prescribed <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> legal retribution (Qasas) for those murdered – the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. [...] But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. [...] But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment."
