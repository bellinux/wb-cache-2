It was incorporated on 15September 2000 and assumed {{the business of}} providing telecom services and network management from the erstwhile Central Government Departments of Telecom Services (DTS) and Telecom Operations (DTO) as of 1October 2000 on a <b>going-concern</b> <b>basis.</b> It is the largest provider of fixed telephony and broadband services with more than 60% market share, and is the fifth largest mobile telephony provider in India. However, in recent years, the company's revenues and market share have plummeted resulting in heavy losses {{as a result of}} intense competition in the Indian telecommunications sector.

It has footprints throughout India, except for Mumbai and New Delhi, where telecommunicatons are managed by Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL).|$|E

Lower of cost or market was considered fair because assets were valued on a <b>going-concern</b> <b>basis,</b> rather than the price at which the assets were purchased.

The concept was not easy for the Academic Accountants to accept due to its lack of logic. Despite the criticism, lower of cost or market quickly caught on in practice and by {{the early twentieth century}} was described as the most commonly accepted method for inventory valuation according to the Report of the Special Committee on Co-operation with Stock Exchanges. Although it lacked accounting logic, lower of cost or market survived because of its conservative approach to valuation and because it addressed opposing principles of cost and value. Its conservatism allowed users to value the inventory at the price for which the inventory could be sold.|$|E

The paper assumes that the main aim of the new regulation is no longer to protect depositors and creditors of a single credit institution from insolvency due to idiosyncratic risk, but to address systemic risks and protect {{the stability of the}} financial system by strengthening the capacity of banks to absorb losses on a <b>going-concern</b> <b>basis.</b> For this reason, in the new context banks are required to hold more capital of better quality...|$|E
