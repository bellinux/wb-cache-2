40|$|ABSTRACT: The γS 1 - and γS 2 -crystallins, {{structural}} {{eye lens}} proteins from the Antarctic toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni),</b> are homologues {{of the human}} lens protein γS-crystallin. Although γS 1 has the higher thermal stability of the two, it is more susceptible to chemical denaturation by urea. The lower thermodynamic stability of both toothfish crystallins relative to human γS-crystallin {{is consistent with the}} current picture of how proteins from organisms endemic to perennially cold environments have achieved low-temperature functionality via greater structural flexibility. In some respects, the sequences of γS 1 - and γS 2 -crystallin are typical of psychrophilic proteins; however, their amino acid compositions also reflect their selection for a high refractive index increment. Like their counterparts in the human lens and those of mesophilic fish, both toothfish crystallins are relatively enriched in aromatic residues and methionine and exiguous in aliphatic residues. The sometimes contradictory requirements of selection for cold tolerance and high refractive index make the toothfish crystallins an excellent model system for further investigation of the biophysical properties of structural proteins...|$|E

The midwaters surrounding the Antarctic continent are productive and underutilized by fishes. There is an evolutionary trend toward pelagism in some notothenioids. We discovered that the largest Antarctic fish, <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni,</b> was neutrally buoyant. Attainment of neutral buoy-ancy was associated with specializations of the skeletal, integumentary, mus-cular, and digestive systems.

The biology of these species in McMurdo Sound is briefly reviewed. 3. Although both Pleuragramma and Dissostichus have extensive lipid deposits that contribute to buoyancy, the mechanisms of lipid storage are different. 4. Pleuragramma is unique among vertebrates in storing lipid in large subcutaneous andintermuscular sacs instead of in adipose cells.

Lipid in Dissostichus is contained in adipose cells in subcutaneous and muscular deposits accounting for 4. 7 % and 4. 8 % of the the body weight, respectively. 6.

40|$|This mini-review makes {{a survey}} and {{a summary of}} some major issues {{concerning}} the chromosomal organisation of ribosomal genes in fish genomes, by using Notothenioidei as the model. The increasing body of information, published {{during the last two}} decades on the chromosomal mapping of the two ribosomal genes classes (45 S rDNA and 5 S rDNA) in notothenioids, makes it possible to recognise the main evolutionary trends across the phylogeny of the group. As one of the major features, the rDNA clusters are organised in a single chromosomal locus in most of the species. This locus is located at different positions along the chromosomes in the basal groups (non-Antarctic Clade), whereas it maintains a strongly conserved location in the cold-adapted species (Antarctic Clade). Important structural changes, leading to the co-localisation of the two ribosomal gene classes, occurred early in the notothenioid phylogeny, perhaps in the common ancestor of the Eleginopidae and Nototheniidae. The cytogenetic evidences indicate that an increased amount of ribosomal genes, organised in two large chromosomal loci, is present in the giant Antarctic fish <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni.</b> This gain in rRNA genes is an important genomic change, having possible implications for the fitness of this notothenioid fish that combines large size, pelagic lifestyle and cold-adaptation...|$|E

Marguerite Bay fishes were 33 % notothenioids and 67 % non-notothenioids. Channichthyids (47 %) and nototheniids (44 %) {{were the most}} abundant notothenioids. The deep-living channichthyid Chionobathyscus dewitti (74 %) and the nototheniid genus Trematomus (66 %) were the most abundant taxa within these two families. The most abundant non-notothenioids were the macrourid Macrourus whitsoni (72 %) and zoarcids (18 %). Amundsen Sea fishes were 87 % notothenioids and 13 % non-notothenioids, the latter exclusively Macrourus whitsoni. Bathydraconids (38 %) and artedidraconids (30 %) were the most abundant notothenioids. We observed that Macrourus whitsoni was benthopelagic and benthic and infested by large ectoparasitic copepods. Juvenile (42 -cm) <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni</b> was not neutrally buoyant and resided on the substrate at 1277 m. Lepidonotothen squamifrons was seen near and on nests of eggs in early December. A Pogonophryne spp. from 2127 m was {{not a member of}} the deep-living unspotted P. albipinna group. Chionobathyscus dewitti inhabited the water column as well as the substate. The pelagic zoarcid Melanostigma gelatinosum was documented in the water column a few meters above the substrate. The zoogeographic character of the Marguerite Bay fauna was West- or low-Antarctic in zoogeographic character and the Amundsen Sea was East- or high-Antarctic...|$|E
40|$|Published or {{accepted}} for publication elsewhere? No ABSTRACT. An uncertainty heretofore has existed over the importance of Antarctic toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni)</b> as prey of top predators in the Ross Sea. We reviewed the literature to assess the relative weight that {{should be given to}} direct, observational evidence of predator diet composition, as opposed to indirect evidence from scat and biochemical analysis. As a result of this assessment, it is evident that toothfish are an important prey of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). Recent findings show the seals do not eat toothfish hard parts, thus providing the reason that toothfish have seldom been detected in scat or stomach samples; biochemical samples have been taken only from seal populations where toothfish do not occur. On the basis of data from an under ice observation platform, non-breeding seals in McMurdo Sound take 0. 8 - 1. 3 toothfish per day. Seals with video recording equipment were seen to closely encounter toothfish but for unknown reasons did not often pursue for capture. It is estimated that the non-breeding portion of the seal population in McMurdo Sound, during spring and summer, consume about 52 tonnes of toothfish. Too many unknowns exist to estimate what the larger, breeding portion consumes during that {{and other parts of the}} year, although it should not b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} the condition factor (K), {{an index of}} weight per unit length, {{in a sample of}} 49 761 longline-caught specimens of Antarctic toothfish, <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni,</b> from the Ross Sea. Our sample consisted of specimens from northern (60 – 708 S) and southern (70 – 788 S) regions. Fifty percent of the northern sample and 4. 9 % of the southern sample were large individuals with a low condition factor (Kah 1. 0182) and displaying an “axe handle (ah) ” morphology with a notably thinner trunk. In the northern sample 55. 4 % of the males and 43. 2 % of the females were less than Kah. In the southern region 5. 3 % of the males and 4. 5 % of the females were less than Kah. The axe handle morphology is attributable to the metabolic loss of muscular and subcutaneous lipid stores, and probably proteins, from white muscle. Our discussion considers energy metabolism as related to migration, feeding and reproduction. We suggest that migration, a life history trait of the phyletically basal notothenioid clades Pseudaphritis and Eleginops, persists in D. mawsoni. The spawning migration from the southern shelf to ridges and seamounts in the north may reflect fidelity to historic spawning grounds. As evidenced by the axe handle specimens neutral buoyancy of large D. mawsoni may be ephemeral, fluctuating over the course of adult life...|$|E
40|$|Killer whales (Orcinus orca), both ecotype-B and-C, are {{important}} to the Ross Sea, Antarctica, ecosystem; the type-C referred to hereafter as “Ross Sea killer whale ” (RS killer whale). Herein we review existing data on occurrence patterns and diet of RS killer whales, and present data on numbers observed in the southwestern Ross Sea. These “resident ” whales appear to feed principally on fish, including Antarctic toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>mawsoni).</b> On the basis of sea watches on the outer coast of Ross Island beginning in 2002 - 03, sighting frequency and average group size began to decrease beginning 2006 - 07 and thereafter; prevalence also decreased in nearby McMurdo Sound. We discuss trends with respect to environmental change as well as the initiation of industrial fishing for toothfish beginning in 1996 - 97. Consistent with a decrease in the catch-per-unit-effort of scientific fishing for toothfish in McMurdo Sound, we suggest that the change in Ross Sea killer whale numbers is related to a contraction of the toothfish stock, and not to changes in the physical environment. We surmise that in this closely-coupled foodweb, composed of very abundant penguin, seal and whale components, loss of the toothfish option for Ross Sea killer whales would force more direct competition for the smaller-fish prey. Therefore, the killer whales have opted {{to move out of the}} region...|$|E
