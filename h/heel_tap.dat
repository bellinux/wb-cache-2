5000|$|The lineup {{remained}} stable for {{the recording of}} 2000's Folkémon, but founding member Walkyier left the band in 2001, citing various reasons, such as financial difficulties and the band's unwillingness to tour in South America owing to security concerns as the final straw, though other band members have commented that his somewhat acerbic personality {{was one of the}} major contributing factors to the group's lineup instability. Walkyier went on to form The Clan Destined. For many fans, Walkyier's lyrics and delivery style were one of the band's central attractions, and there were fears that his departure spelled the end of the band. After replacing drummer Jay Graham (who left shortly after Walkyier) with drummer Arron Walton, and moving Kevin Ridley onto vocals, the group sprang into action to remedy these fears with 2002's No Daylights...

The single featured two recordings of the track, one of them with Ridley on vocals and one with Ridley sharing the microphone with Ten Pole Tudor's vocalist Edward Tudor-Pole. The single/album release was accompanied by The Same...But Different tour, the largest Skyclad had undertaken for many years.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the landing phase of hurdle clearance to investigate how the vertical displacement in the hurdler’s {{center of mass}} and foot pressures at ground contact lead {{to a change in}} the hurdler’s overall horizontal velocity of the center of mass. This study examined four male collegiate high hurdlers as they performed three trials of clearing one 42 inch high hurdle. The subjects were filmed during the three trials using three Panasonic cameras (60 Hz) and one JVC video camera (60 Hz), which was later used to provide video images in order to digitize each frame using the APAS software. The subjects’ foot pressure mapping data was also recorded at a sampling rate of 400 Hz during the three trials using the Tekscan high resolution (HR) Fscan hardware and software. The Tekscan HR Fscan hardware and software allowed for pressure measurements of the subjects’ forefoot, heel, and total foot pressure measured in pounds per square inch. The data collected from the APAS software and the Tekscan software was then calculated using the statistical software package SPSS. Multiple Pearson product correlations were analyzed between the kinematic and kinetic variables with one of these correlations resulting in a moderate relationship. The correlation between the change in the center of mass horizontal velocity and the heel pressure psi during the landing phase resulted in a moderate relationship with a correlation coefficient of r =. 612, p=. 034. The relationship between these two variables indicates that when a hurdler <b>heel</b> <b>taps</b> during the transitioning from flight phase to landing phase there is a decrease in their horizontal velocity.

40|$|Parkinsonism {{is defined}} as an akinetic-rigid {{syndrome}} that mimics idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). 1 It is seen {{in a number of}} neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies as well as from medications and as a fea-ture of normal aging. It has been our observation that parkinsonism is frequently not appreciated by doctors and other health professionals, especially when tremor is absent. 2 Tremor is present in about 80 % of people with IPD, 40 % of people with drug-induced parkinsonism, 1 and vir-tually no people with the other parkinsonian syndromes; thus, parkinsonism is frequently underappreciated. One study found that 50 % of patients receiving neurological con-sultations at a community teaching hospital who had parkinsonism identified by the neurologist were not iden-tified as having parkinsonism by the medical house staff, medical attendings, or other staff. 2 Psychiatry residents, in the era of neuroleptics before atypical antipsychotics, often failed to recognize parkinsonism despite training in the motor side effects of the drugs. 3, 4 Drug-induced parkin-sonism, when recognized in the elderly, is also often treated incorrectly. 5 We were invited to evaluate all residents at a nursing home (NH) as part of a quality assurance initiative to reduce falls. We assessed all residents for evidence of parkinsonism to compare our impressions with those in the chart.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between perceived rhythm and underlying reference structures {{in the experience of}} rhythm in music. The point of departure is that both music performers’ and perceivers’ body motions are relevant to the study of rhythm. Accordingly, in music genres with an intimate relationship to dance, here referred to as music–dance, rhythm needs to be understood in relation to the corresponding dance. The studies included in this thesis investigate rhythm patterns in sound and body motion in two music–dance styles, Brazilian samba and Norwegian telespringar, based on motion capture and sound recordings of professional musicians and dancers. Both samba and telespringar consist of complex rhythm patterns. Samba is often characterized by so-called systematic microtiming at the sixteenth-note level. This was confirmed in our sound analysis of the samba groove, showing a medium–medium–medium–long duration pattern at the sixteenth-note level. In addition, motion analysis of the percussionist’s <b>heel</b> <b>tapping</b> and the dancer’s steps revealed motion patterns in synchrony with this rhythm pattern. Telespringar, on the other hand, is often described as featuring a so-called asymmetrical triple meter—that is, the three beats in a measure are of uneven duration. According to previous studies, both the fiddler’s foot stamping and the dancers’ vertical body motions are related to this underlying meter. This relation was confirmed in the motion analysis of a fiddler’s foot stamping, which revealed a very stable long–medium–short duration pattern at the beat level. The dancers’ vertical motion patterns, however, deviated from theories suggesting that the turning points in the dancers’ vertical motion curves correspond to the meter. The thesis therefore suggests an alternative interpretation with regard to the dancers’ vertical motion curves—that it is the shape of the dancers’ vertical motion that corresponds to the underlying beat duration, rather than the turning points that correspond to the underlying beat positions. The main conclusion is that the underlying sixteenth-note level in samba and the underlying beat level in telespringar should not be understood as deviations from an isochronous pulse of some sort. Instead, they should be understood as inherently (and necessarily) non-isochronous, in and of themselves...|$|R

40|$|Three motor {{coordination}} tests(finger sequencing, FS; diadochokinesis, DK; <b>heel</b> toe <b>tapping,</b> HTT), {{which are}} clinically used in oder to elicit soft neurological signs (SNS) {{were administered to}} 58 normal, right-handed students (age range: 18 to 22 years).

The performance of these movements was assessed by two types of technique; one was the measuring the time required {{and the other was}} the scoring of the degree of accuracy, rhythm and the magnitude of associated movements from videotapes. The correlation analysis found relatively weak relationship between the results of these two types of assessments, which suggests that both types of assessments should be used crinically.

The significant right-left difference (right-side dominance) appeared in the DK only when assessed by time measuring.

5000|$|Had Robinson {{attended}} dance {{school in}} the 1930s, he would have learned a slower Broadway style of tap dancing. Coming from a street tradition that emphasized speed and flash, his mature style developed from close observation and imitation of the dancers of his day with particular interest in fast dancing. Robinson's encyclopedic knowledge of tap dancers, and his sense {{of the importance of}} the history, led him to create dances such as Robinson's Waltz Clog in tribute to Pat Rooney and Robinson's Impersonation of Bill Bailey impersonating Bill [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson imitating Peg Leg Bates. In the piece, he opens with a basic [...] "Bojangles" [...] time step before jumping into a one-legged Peg Leg Bates step. Known as the fastest taps in the business, [...] Robinson was a master and innovator of the paddle and roll step. The exact origins of the paddle and roll is not certain. Not seen in tap dancing of the 1920s, elements of it appeared in the 1930s in the dancing of John Bubbles and Willie Bryant; one story tells of it being brought to New York in 1937 by Walter Green. The paddle and roll solidly entered the vocabulary of tap dancing in the late 1940s. Paddle and roll is a combination of <b>heel</b> and toe <b>taps</b> sounded as sixteenth notes creating a drum roll sound. From that one basic step, Robinson was able to create an endless number of variations. Fundamentally constructing compositions on the paddle, Robinson was able to subdivide the quarter note, macro beat into four sixteenth note beats. This also allowed him to easily subdivide the beat further. Most other tap compositions originate from swing eighth note beats, commonly through the flap or shuffle. This fundamental only easily allows tap composers to subdivide the quarter note, macro beat, into triplet eighth note beats. Employing his innovative subdivision scheme, even when Robinson used patterns common to many tap dancers, the steps fit into these complicated structures on the microscopic scale. So combinations that would be slow, broad gestures in other works become quick, fleeting details in his highly complex, intricate, infectious compositions. [...] "Robinson elevated the art form of tap. The rhythmic intricacy and complexity that he invented developed tap into a mature percussive musical form. So much of what tap dancers do today would not be possible without LaVaughn's innovations." [...] In an encapsulation of a lifetime of thinking about tap dance, his solo piece Artistry in Taps, contains a wealth of the ideas that can be expressed in tap dancing. A completely choreographed piece developed over decades, Robinson drew on all the aspects of his life experience.|$|R
40|$|We {{begin this}} {{paper with a}} scene taken from a 1950 ’s musical. Fred Astaire, playing an aging musical star in search for a second career, enters a shopping-mall, called ‘Arcade’. He stumbles over the feet of a shoeshine ‘boy’, a black adult person who is portrayed in a very stereotypical way: shabby, goofy and cack-handed. Their gazes meet and Astaire starts a song, {{apparently}} forgetting the nagging doubts he had concerning his future career. While getting his shoes polished – Astaire sitting comfortably in a high chair and the black man kneeling {{in front of him}} – the big star continues singing, demonstrating his skills as one of the world’s best tap-dancers. All this causes an atmosphere of cheerfulness. As the scene develops this particular mood only increases, as Astaire seems to become literally overpowered by an urge to move about the place, <b>tapping</b> <b>heel</b> and toe to the floor in an ever increasing frenzy, which – so it seems – is unstoppable. The fast and syncopating rhythm of his over-excited moves is echoed by the words he sings: the song, which started as a mere poetical comment on a very banal event (‘When there is a shine on your shoes, there is a melody in your heart. What a wonderful way to start the day’), becomes itself prone to a rhythmical frenzy. Astaire isn't able to stop the flow of his words, which at a certain moment consists in nothing but the endless repetition of the same words: ‘shoeshine, shoeshine’. And so the scene comes to a climax where Astaire drags along the shoeshine boy in a shared dance. When their dance is over the black servant is sitting on his knees again, left to stay in the Arcade, whilst the star of the movie, still standing upright, leaves the Arcade, brightly smiling. 	In this paper we will defend that this scene, taken from Minnelli’s film The Band Wagon (1953), deserves the attention of philosophers of education because it exemplifies an educational moment par excellence. We are prompted to this reading by some ideas of Stanley Cavell which we will develop further here in dialogue with another philosopher, Giorgio Agamben. The ideas we develop here go against the grain of much educational thought on this kind of outright western-centered and racist cinema. Nonetheless, we will argue for a view that takes this scene in and of itself as educational: without wanting to deny what is plainly and painfully visible – a reaffirmation of the white man’s superiority and a legitimization of a structural form of injustice –, we argue that the way in which words and movements in this scene function are expressive of an event that can be read as a (temporary) liberation from existing power structures. With Agamben and Cavell, we will describe this scene through the figure of the child and conceive of what happens here as a new beginning. status: publishe...|$|R
