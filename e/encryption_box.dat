40|$|The {{potential}} {{weakness of}} the Y- 00 direct encryption protocol is demonstrated in a fast correlation attack by S. Donnet et al in Phys. Lett. A 35 6 (2006) 406 - 410, when the <b>encryption</b> <b>box</b> ENC in Y- 00 is not chosen properly. In this paper, we show how this weakness can be eliminated with a proper design of ENC. In particular, we present a Y- 00 configuration that is more secure than AES. It is also shown that under any ciphertext-only attack, full information-theoretic security on the Y- 00 seed key is obtained for any ENC when proper deliberate signal randomization is employed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} note II {{introduces a}} way to understand a basic concept of the quantum enigma cipher. The conventional cipher is designed by a mathematical algorithm and its security is evaluated by {{the complexity of the}} algorithm in security analysis and ability of computers. This kind of cipher can be decrypted with probability one in principle by the Brute force attack in which an eavesdropper tries all the possible keys based on the correct ciphertext and some known plaintext. A cipher with quantum effects in physical layer may protect the system from the Brute force attack by means of the quantum no cloning theorem and randomizations based on quantum noise effect. The randomizations for the ciphertext which is the output from the mathematical <b>encryption</b> <b>box</b> is crucial to realize a quantum enigma cipher. Especially, by randomizations, it is necessary to make a substantial difference in accuracy of ciphertext in eavesdropper's observation and legitimate user's observation. The quantum illumination protocol {{can make a difference in}} error performance of the legitimate's receiver and the eavesdropper's receiver. This difference is due to differences in ability of the legitimate's receiver with entanglement and the eavesdropper's receiver without entanglement. It is shown in this note that the quantum illumination can be employed as an element of the most simple quantum enigma cipher. Comment: Submitted to Quantum ICT Research Institute Bulleti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} {{has been}} envisioned as the next-generation architecture of IT. Drop box {{is one of}} the most popular cloud storage services in the world. Dropbox was arguably the first cloud storage service that promoted mass adoption thanks to a referral program and an intuitive interface. Dropbox cemented its place on our mobile devices with a range of capable apps, and developers have figured out ways to use it for all kinds of purposes: server backups, Google Docs sync and browser add-ons, to name just three. But with Dropbox, there’s one challenge: privacy. In this paper we discuss the overview of various encryption algorithms or programs for drop <b>box</b> <b>encryption...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Secure multiparty {{computation}} (MPC) allows multiple par-ties {{to evaluate}} functions without disclosing the private inputs. Secure comparisons (testing equality and greater-than) are important primitives required by many MPC applications. We propose two equality tests for `-bit values with O(1) online communication that require O(`) respectively O(κ) total work, where κ is a correctness parameter. Combining these with ideas of Toft [16], we obtain (i) a greater-than protocol with sublinear online complexity in the arithmetic black-box model (O(c) rounds and O(c · ` 1 /c) work online, with c = log ` resulting in logarithmic online work). In difference to Toft, {{we do not}} assume two mutually incorruptible parties, but O(`) offline work is required, and (ii) two greater-than protocols with the same online complexity as the above, but with overall complexity reduced to O(log `(κ+ loglog `)) and O(c·` 1 /c(κ+log `)); these require two mutually incorruptible parties, but are highly competitive with respect to online complexity when compared to existing protocols.

40|$|Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) is one {{significant}} research area in information security. In SMC, multiple parties jointly work on some function and no parties {{take the risk}} of revealing their private data. Since A. C. Yao first proposed this problem in 1982, {{there have been a lot}} of researchers working on different versions of SMC. In this thesis, we address three different researches in this setting, including the Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Scientific Computation, Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM), and PPDM in cloud environment. In Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Scientific Computation, we propose a solution to the Privacy Preserving Weighted Average Problem (PPWAP) under the hybrid security model, which guarantees the malicious parties will not get the correct final result if they behalf maliciously. Later, the extended version of our scheme is shown as a highly efficient and secure PPWAP solution under the malicious model, a stronger security model requiring more resource. Privacy reserving data mining is one important branch of SMC, where all participants want to get the same and correct mining result from collaborated data mining without any threat of disclosing their private data. In another word, each party refuses to review its individual private database while carrying out collaborated data mining. We propose a PPDM solution of building up a decision tree from a hybrid distributed database, which is a quite common situation in real life but has not been solved before. Previous research works only focus on horizontally or vertically distributed database. With the great development of cloud computing, it provides a much more flexible and efficient platform for Internet service providers and users. However, the privacy issues of cloud service has become the bottleneck of its further development, and this problem also draw a lot of researchers' attention in recent decade. In this thesis, we propose the first solution to cloud-based PPDM. The cloud server carries out data mining on encrypted databases, and our solution can guarantee the privacy of each client. This scheme can protect client from malicious users. With aid of a hardware box, our design can also protect clients from untrusted cloud server. Another novel feature of this solution is that it works even when the databases from different parties share overlapped parts. Furthermore, with the help of homomorphic <b>encryption</b> and black <b>box,</b> our scheme can carry out the calculation on the overlapped data. This kind of problem has never been resolved by previous works as far as we know. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
