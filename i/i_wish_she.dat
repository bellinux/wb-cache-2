500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> would have said in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> would just resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> was still here. She was jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E

500|$|Auditions {{were held}} for the part of Sarah, the eldest {{daughter}} of the Barnes family and actress Loui Batley secured the role. On 1 July 2009, Digital Spy reported that Loui Batley had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of}} the year. Loui's decision matched co-worker Zoë Lister (Zoë Carpenter). The Hollyoaks website officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Batley and Lister would leave towards the end of that year. Their final storyline was described as a [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", stating that either Sarah or Zoë would die. Batley wanted to quit the serial in December 2008 when her contract ran out. Kirkwood asked her to stay another six months with the promise of a good exit storyline. The plot also involved Zoe and Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). She made it clear to Kirkwood and new executive producer Lucy Allan that she would leave afterward. Allan then came up with the idea of writing Batley out of the serial in its sister show Hollyoaks Later. Upon hearing Kirkwood's ideas for her exit storyline, Batley said: [...] "I've been there for quite a while and it was a great ending for the character - I couldn't have asked for a better way to go..." [...] Hollyoaks Later producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "Loui's been brilliant in Hollyoaks and she's massively underrated. She's been at the centre of some of the biggest storylines on the main show. She never turned in a performance less than top-notch and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> had a little more recognition for that. She's a very strong actress and it's been fantastic to work with her - and great to be involved in her exit." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>she</b> was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When I get You Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{this initial}} failure, {{she began to}} sing her own songs on the busy street corners in Shibuya, Tokyo with a {{microphone}} and a radio cassette player. To become famous, she set herself the goal of performing 1,000 times on the street. Nobody paid attention to her songs at first, but the crowd gradually grew as she kept performing on streets and she met people who gave her support, culminating her major debut and the 2003 hit single [...] "Asueno tobira" [...] (Door to Tomorrow), which sold more than 900,000 copies. She sang the song as the vocalist of the duo <b>I</b> <b>Wish.</b> <b>She</b> has been performing solo since the duo broke up in 2005. Her second solo single, [...] "12-ko no Kisetsu" [...] (12 Seasons) ranked 10th on the Billboard Hits of the world, Japan. Even after her major debut, she kept performing on streets and, in 2005, she accomplished 1,000 street performances, which, according to Kawashima, became the foundation of her music. In 2009, she performed at Japan Day at Central Park, New York.|$|E

60|$|I {{made up my}} mind {{to speak}} to Dora about this; and one day when we were out walking (for we were {{licensed}} by Miss Lavinia, after a while, to go out walking by ourselves), I said to her that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could get them to behave towards her differently.|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought this}} both bold and decided; and I looked anxiously at Anneke, {{to note the}} effect; but she evidently {{received}} it as trifling, certainly betraying no emotion at a speech I thought so pointed. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had manifested a little resentment. Then she was so very young to be thus importuned! ...|$|R

60|$|He kissed her. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> would utter some hysterical cry, so that I {{might get}} relief and be at ease. She made wonderfully little noise: {{she seemed to}} have got what she wanted--all she wanted, and to be in a trance of content.

6000|$|... "No, she isn't. I {{warned her}} not to put her hair in curls but she wouldn't listen to me. <b>I</b> guess <b>she</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>she</b> had now. When people haven't natural curly hair they shouldn't {{try to make it}} curly. They get punished if they do." ...|$|R
