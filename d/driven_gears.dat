50|$|Under one {{possible}} design, the transmission's input shaft has just one pinion gear, which drives the countershaft. Along the countershaft are mounted gears of various sizes, which rotate when the input shaft rotates. These gears {{correspond to the}} forward speeds and reverse. Each of the forward gears on the countershaft is permanently meshed with a corresponding gear on the output shaft. However, these <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> are not rigidly attached to the output shaft: although the shaft runs through them, they spin independently of it, which is made possible by bearings in their hubs. Reverse is typically implemented differently; see the section on Reverse.|$|E

Instead {{of a lower}} {{unit with}} forward, neutral and reverse gears, its lower units were more compact, with only drive and <b>driven</b> <b>gears,</b> and no submerged shift mechanism required. Reverse was selected by turning off the engine and restarting it in opposite rotation, and neutral by simply switching off.Mark 75s, like many of their smaller bretrhen, were available in an [...] "H" [...] (high speed) version. Many of these large H engines sported open headers for competition and produced 90 horsepower from 60 cubic inches. Two totally stock Mark 75s set a world endurance record on Lake X, running 50,000 miles {{at an average of}} 30.3 mph, while being re-fueled on the fly. The boats were stopped only for driver changes and standard maintenance. After the record setting run was completed, the motors were torn down and inspected for wear. They were found to be well within factory tolerances. The amazing distance has never been topped, even with modern advancements in outboard technology.|$|E

In this paper, the {{theoretical}} flow ripple of an external gear pump is studied for pumps of similar size using different numbers of teeth on the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gears.</b> External gear pumps {{with three different}} types of tooth profiles are studied. Nondimensional flowrates and fluctuation coefficients of gear pumps are discussed. By using the formula, flowrates can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Results indicate that: {{in the case of}} the same displacement (except teeth number and tooth width, other parameters of the gear pump are the same) the gear pump flow pulsation decreases with the increasing of the teeth number. We also concluded that changing tooth profiles on the driving and driven gear can get different pulse amplitude of the flow ripple...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a model for the evaluation of pressure transients occurring within an involute tooth form twin-pinion gear pump and addresses, in particular, the influence of cavitation. The latter can cause erosion, limiting the life of such pumps, and liberate hard particles, leading to secondary damage elsewhere. The model considers the inter-tooth volumes that are formed at the roots of the driver and <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> and utilizes the continuity equations by considering compressible flow into and out of these volumes. Cavitation arising from insufficient flow into the expanding inter-tooth volumes is taken into account. The continuity equations are expressed in terms of fluid density rather than pressure. Hence correct solutions are ensured even during cavitating conditions, when the minimum void pressure is fixed at the appropriate vapour pressure. The effectiveness of the model is assessed through gear pump meshing pressure measurement and flow visualization. The significant influence of inlet pressure ripple on low-pressure predictions is also investigated...|$|E

The device {{is based on}} self-locking worm and worm wheel and slot-and-crank drive. Its mechanical properties and calculation formula is also given out. After the device being driven by gear motor, output torque rotates the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> first, and then transmits the driving force to the upper and the lower worms; Then the upper and the lower worms rotate their meshing worm gears separately and the worm gears sway the upper and the lower crank-connecting rods articulated in worm gears; Lastly, three times amplification of the force is realized by the force-amplifier of the upper and the lower crank connecting rods. The device can center automatically {{up and down and}} clamps the workpiece. Besides, the device is with less energy conversion equipments, compact structure, well flexibility and high greenization.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{evaluating}} the kinematic flow rate of a crescent oil pump is presented. The procedure also allows calculating the angular derivatives of the delivery, suction and trapped volumes of the pump, which are the prerequisites for the simulation of the unit using a lumped parameters approach. The method {{is based on the}} knowledge of the length of the vector rays between the centres of the gears and the contact points. From the volume derivatives, an analytic expression of the pump displacement and of the kinematic flow ripple index is obtained. Moreover, the same formula can also be applied to external gear machines. Finally, in this study the influence of the number of teeth of the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> has been assessed. The increase of the number of teeth of the inner gear is beneficial; both for the reduction of the flow ripple and for the increase of the displacement at equal overall pump size...|$|E
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed driving gears (pinions) transfer the motion to the driven unselected gears (loose gears) through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as loose gears). As a result, the idle (loose) gears oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the driving gears. The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the transmission bell housing, and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The severe {{global climate}} changes result in {{consecutive}} torrential rains in rainy season, and causes water loss and soil erosion. For an effective water and soil conservation, geotextiles {{are commonly used}} in geotechnical engineering. Geotextiles should able to isolate soil, filter water, and reinforce the soil; therefore, the material for geotextiles should be acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET). This study uses PP fibers as the skin and PET plied yarns as the core to form PP/PET composite tubular knits on a cord knitting machine. The PET plied yarn is fed with a specified tensile strength, and only the tooth number of the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> varies. Mechanical property test results show that a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth increases the tensile strength of the resulting tubular knits; however, with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 35 teeth, the tensile strength decreases. An optimal core coverage occurs with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{internal}} fluid dynamic of a high-pressure external gear pump is described in this paper. The pump has been analyzed with both numerical and experimental techniques. Starting from a geometry of the pump, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been built up using the commercial code PumpLinx®. All leakages have been {{taken into account in}} order to estimate the volumetric efficiency of the pump. Then the pump has been tested on a test bench of Casappa S. p. A. Model results like the volumetric efficiency, absorbed torque, and outlet pressure ripple have been compared with the experimental data. The model has demonstrated the ability to predict with good accuracy the performance of the real pump. The CFD model has been also used to evaluate the effect on the pump performance of clearances in the meshing area. With the validated model the pressure inside the chambers of both driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gears</b> have been studied underlining cavitation in meshing fluid volume of the pump. For this reason, the model has been implemented in order to predict the cavitation phenomena. The analysis has allowed the detection of cavitating areas, especially at high rotation speeds and delivery pressure. Isosurfaces of the fluid volume have been colored {{as a function of the}} total gas fraction to underline where the cavitation occurs...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Gear rattle is caused by engine torsional vibration (engine order response) imparted to the transmission components, further causing the gears to oscillate within their functional backlashes. These oscillations lead to the repetitive impact of gear teeth, which lead to noisy responses, referred to as gear rattle. The lack of in-depth research into the effect of lubricant on gear rattle {{has been identified as}} a deficiency in the previous research in rattle. The aim ofthe current work is to address this shortcoming. The thesis outlines a new approach in investigating the problem of idle gear rattle. The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that under idling condition the teeth-pair impact loads are sufficiently low and the gear speeds are sufficiently high to permit the formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant film between the mating gear teeth. This film acts as a non-linear spring-damper that couples the driver and the <b>driven</b> <b>gears.</b> A torsional single-degree of freedom model is used in the development of the theory. The model is then expanded into a seven-degree of freedom torsional model and finally into an Il-degree of freedom model that also includes the lateral vibrations of the supporting shafts. The Il-degree of freedom model is based on a real life transmission that is also used in experimental studies to validate the model. It is found that lubricant viscosity and bearing clearance (lubricant resistance in squeeze) play important roles in determining the dynamics of the system and its propensity to rattle. At low temperatures, the lateral vibrations of the shafts, carrying the gears interfere with the gear teeth impact action. The severity of rattle is determined by the relationship between the entraining and squeeze film actions of the hydrodynamic film. When the latter dominates, the system can rattle more severely. The numerical results are found to correlate well with the experimental findings obtained from vehicle tests in a semi-anechoic chamber and also with those from a transmission test rig in the powertrain laboratory...|$|E
