5|$|The {{court was}} told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar {{treatment}} from Acton: a beating, followed by time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> or strong room, before being {{moved to the}} sick ward, where they were left to {{lie on the floor}} in leg irons.|$|E

Rinder says that Miscavige was furious with the way that Sweeney had been handled and ordered Rinder to go to Sussex to dig ditches on a Church property there. He defected instead, eventually settling in Denver.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E

5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} four days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> in 2004 but {{says that he}} left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Sausages are {{commonly}} eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> Lancashire hotpot {{is a well}} known stew in the northwest. Some {{of the more popular}} cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue Stilton. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick – all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones (either plain or containing dried fruit) served with jam and/or cream, dried fruit loaves, Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits. Common drinks include tea, whose popularity was increased by Catherine of Braganza, whilst frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wines, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale.|$|E
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E

30|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam blocks with 0.2  g/cm 3 density and dimensions of 10  ×  10  ×  5  cm {{were used as}} substitutes for cancellous bone (Bailey et al. 2006), according to the ASTM F 1839. To {{determine the effect of}} tunnel diameter on initial fixation and required torque of insertion, four holes were created on each foam block with diameters of 7, 8, 9, and 10  mm. Polypropylene ropes with 8  mm diameter were used as graft substitutes.

5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{cryoconite}} <b>holes</b> of <b>the</b> McMurdo Dry Valleys are simple, closed biogeochemical systems involving water, ice, mineral {{and organic}} debris, which serve as ecosystems for consortia of microorganisms. This {{study is the}} first to document the seasonal and annual chemical evolution of solutes in cryoconite holes. Samples of glacier ice, frozen cryoconite holes and those containing water were collected during the austral summer of 2005 – 2006. The isolation age was calculated from <b>the</b> excess Cl− <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> and varied from 0 to 5 years (a), consistent with the last hot summer when <b>the</b> cryoconite <b>holes</b> were open to <b>the</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> progressively deepen with isolation age. Variations in DIC, DOC, K+ and SO 42 − suggest that dissolution of primary minerals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cryoconite debris, cyclical precipitation and dissolution of secondary carbonates, net photosynthesis over summer and net respiration during the autumnal freeze are the principal reactions which perturb the seasonal and annual solute concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> DOC is generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> at a rate of 7. 5 μg C cm− 2 a− 1, and non-sea-salt K+ accumulates in frozen holes at a rate of 0. 073 μeq cm− 2 a− 1.
