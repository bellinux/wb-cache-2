For hazards that are considered not to have thresholds for their mode of action, low-dose extrapolation and other modelling approaches may be applied. The default position is that rodents are good models for humans. However, some chemicals cause species-specific toxicity syndromes. Information on quantitative species differences is used to modify the default uncertainty factors applied to extrapolate from experimental animals to humans. A central theme for extrapolation is unravelling the mode of action for the critical effects observed. Food {{can be considered as}} an extremely complex and variable chemical mixture. Interactions among {{low molecular}} weight chemicals are expected to be rare given that the exposure levels generally are far below their NOAELs. <b>Hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> of micronutrients must consider that adverse effects may arise from intakes that are too low (deficiency) as well as too high (toxicity).

40|$|International audienceSHYREG {{method is}} a regionalized method for {{rainfall}} and flood frequency analysis (FFA). It {{is based on}} processes simulation. It couples an hourly rainfall generator with a rainfall-runoff model, simplified enough to be regionalized. The method has been calibrated using all hydro meteorological data available at the national level. In France, that represents about 2800 raingauges of the French Weather Service network and about 1800 stations of the hydrometric National Bank network. Then, the method has been regionalized to provide a rainfall and flow quantiles database. An evaluation of the method was carried out during different thesis works and more recently during the ANR project Extraflo, {{with the aim of}} comparing different FFA approaches. The accuracy of the method in estimating rainfall and flow quantiles has been proved, as well as its stability due to a parameterization based on average values. The link with rainfall seems preferable to extrapolation based solely on the flow. Thus, another interest of the method is to take into account extreme flood behaviour with help of rainfall frequency estimation. In addition, the approach is implicitly multi-durational, and only one regionalization meets all the needs in terms hydrological <b>hazards</b> <b>characterisation.</b> For engineering needs and to avoid repeating the method implementation, this method has been applied throughout a 50 meters resolution mesh to provide a complete flood quantiles database over the French territory providing regional information on hydrological hazards. However, it is subject to restrictions related {{to the nature of the}} method: the SHYREG flows are "natural", and do not take into account specific cases like the basins highly influenced by presence of hydraulic works, flood expansion areas, high snowmelt or karsts.

40|$|Information on hazard identification, <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> (including dose–response assessment) and {{exposure}} assessment are brought together under risk characterisation {{in order to}} provide advice to risk managers. Hazard identification and characterisation define the adverse effects produced by the chemical and are used to determine a health-based guidance value, such as an acceptable daily intake for threshold effects, or an estimate of the intake associated with a predefined level of risk for non-threshold effects. Exposure assessment aims to define average and high intakes, and has to take into account different dietary patterns. <b>Hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> {{and exposure}} data need to be closely inter-related, for example the data should relate to the same life-stages and durations of exposure. Risk characterisation has to be an iterative process in which information on hazard and exposure are matched and any discrepancy taken into account where necessary by the generation of additional data.

40|$|AbstractRecent EU {{legislation}} has introduced {{endocrine disrupting properties}} as a hazard-based “cut-off” criterion for the approval of active substances as pesticides and biocides. Currently, no specific science-based approach {{for the assessment of}} substances with endocrine disrupting properties has been agreed upon, although this new legislation provides interim criteria based on classification and labelling. Different proposals for decision making on potential endocrine disrupting properties in human health risk assessment have been developed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and other regulatory bodies. All these frameworks, although differing with regard to <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation,</b> include a toxicological assessment of adversity of the effects, the evaluation of underlying modes/mechanisms of action in animals and considerations concerning the relevance of effects to humans. Three options for regulatory decision making were tested upon 39 pesticides for their applicability and to analyze their potential impact on the regulatory status of active substances that are currently approved for use in Europe: Option 1, based purely on hazard identification (adversity, mode of action, and the plausibility that both are related); Option 2, based on hazard identification and additional elements of <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> (severity and potency); Option 3, based on the interim criteria laid down in the recent EU pesticides legislation. Additionally, the data analysed in this study were used to address the questions, which parts of the endocrine system were affected, which studies were the most sensitive and whether no observed adverse effect levels were observed for substance with ED properties. The results of this exercise represent preliminary categorisations and must not be used as a basis for definitive regulatory decisions. They demonstrate that a combination of criteria for hazard identification with additional criteria of <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> allows prioritising and differentiating between substances with regard to their regulatory concern. It is proposed to integrate these elements into a decision matrix to be used within a weight of evidence approach for the toxicological categorisation of relevant endocrine disruptors and to consider all parts of the endocrine system for regulatory decision making on endocrine disruption...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{sensitisation}} potential of chemicals is currently assessed using in vivo methods where the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is typically {{the method of}} first choice. Current regulatory initiatives are driving {{the impetus for the}} use of in vitro/in silico alternative approaches to provide the relevant information needed for the effective assessment of {{skin sensitisation}}, for both <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> and risk assessment purposes. A chemical must undergo a number of steps for it to induce skin sensitisation but the main determining step is formation of a stable covalent association with carrier protein. The ability of a chemical to react covalently with carrier protein nucleophiles relates to both its electrophilic reactivity and its hydrophobicity. This paper focuses on quantitative indices of electrophilic reactivity with nucleophiles, in a chemical mechanism-ofaction context, and compares and contrasts the experimental approaches available to generate reactivity data that are suitable for mathematical modelling and making predictions of skin sensitisation potential, using new chemistry data correlated against existing in vivo bioassay data. As such, the paper goes on to describe an illustrative example of how quantitative kinetic measures of reactivity can be usefully and simply applied to perform mechanism-based read-across that enables <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> of skin sensitisation potential. An illustration of the types of quantitative mechanistic models that could be built using databases of kinetic measures of reactivity, hydrophobicity and existing in vivo bioassay data is also given.

Contrary to other recent {{papers on the}} subject, the main data requirements, models and advancement {{within each of the}} four risk assessment domains are described, i. e., in the: (i) materials, (ii) release, fate and exposure, (iii) hazard and (iv) risk characterisation domains. The material, which is obviously the foundation for any risk assessment, should be described according to the legislatively required characterisation data. Characterisation data will also be used at various levels within the ERA, e. g., exposure modelling. The release, fate and exposure data and models cover the input for environmental distribution models in order to identify the potential (PES) and relevant exposure scenarios (RES) and, subsequently, the possible release routes, both with regard to which compartment(s) NMs are distributed in line with the factors determining the fate within environmental compartment.

40|$|Background: It is {{a common}} medical {{practice}} to characterise an infection based on the causative agent and to adopt therapeutic and prevention strategies targeting the agent itself. However, from an epidemiological perspective, exposure to a microbe can be harmless to a host {{as a result of}} low-level exposure or due to host immune response, with opportunistic infection only occurring as a result of changes in the host, pathogen, or surrounding environment. Methods: We have attempted to review systematically the key host, pathogen, and environmental factors that may significantly impact clinical outcomes of exposure to a pathogen, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye infection as a case study. Results and discussion: Extended contact lens wearing and compromised hygiene may predispose users to microbial keratitis, which can be a severe and vision-threatening infection. P. aeruginosa has a wide array of virulence-associated genes and sensing systems to initiate and maintain cell populations at the corneal surface and beyond. We have adapted the well-known concept of the epidemiological triangle in combination with the classic risk assessment framework (<b>hazard</b> identification, <b>characterisation,</b> and exposure) to develop a conceptual pathway-based model that demonstrates the overlapping relationships between the host, the pathogen, and the environment; and to illustrate the key events in P. aeruginosa eye infection. Conclusion: This strategy differs from traditional approaches that consider potential risk factors in isolation, and hopefully will aid the identification of data and models to inform preventive and therapeutic measures in addition to risk assessment. Furthermore, this may facilitate the identification of knowledge gaps to direct research in areas of greatest impact to avert or mitigate adverse outcomes of infection...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Managing the {{rockfall}} hazard is {{a complex}} task, which involves several phases from land planning {{to the design of}} protective structures. Despite the increasing interest in rockfall-related research over the last few decades, some issues remain only partially addressed to date. In particular, existing predictive tools for the simulation of block trajectories could be improved and the criteria for the design of flexible metallic barriers are potentially flawed by block size effects. In the Australian context, the lack of research into rockfall phenomena has prevented the development of a comprehensive <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> so far; moreover, some types of barriers currently in use present cost-effectiveness issues. In this thesis, formed by six peer-reviewed publications, the aforementioned issues are investigated, with the aim of improving the knowledge regarding rockfall, especially for the Australian environment. The first paper presents the results of extensive in situ tests performed in different geological environments in NSW. Rockfall motion parameters are obtained {{for the first time in}} the Australian context and uncommonly high values of the normal coefficient of restitution are highlighted. An investigation of these results is undertaken in the second paper through extensive laboratory testing: low impacting angles, rotational energy and block shape are correlated to the high values of kn obtained in the experiments. In the third paper, the results from in situ tests are applied to real profiles taken from a database of Australian slopes: a basic <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> is performed using a 2 D lumped mass model and low impact energy values are found for most of the cases. The fourth paper shows a comparison between four different flexible barriers, carried out by full-scale laboratory testing. The results provide an insight on the estimation of the barriers’ performance: in particular, stiffness and load transmission are evaluated, and modifications to improve the performance of one of the systems are suggested.

A combined enzymatic and acidic chemical hydrolysis followed by a double purification on two successive C(18) and SiOH Solid Phase Extraction cartridges permitted to efficiently purify milk, cereals and baby-food samples while eliminating naturally occurring estrogen hormones. A specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric measurement authorised unambiguous identification and quantification of the target compounds.

A range of uncertainties exist through the source-to-outcome continuum, including exposure assessment, <b>hazard</b> and risk <b>characterisation.</b> While various strategies have been applied to characterising uncertainty, classical approaches largely rely on how to maximise the available resources. Expert judgement, defaults and tools for characterising quantitative uncertainty attempt {{to fill the gap}} between data and regulation requirements. The experiences of researching 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) illustrated uncertainty sources and how to maximise available information to determine uncertainties, and thereby provide an 'adequate' protection to contaminant exposure. As regulatory requirements and recurring issues increase, the assessment of complex scenarios involving a large number of chemicals requires more sophisticated tools. Recent advances in exposure and toxicology science provide a large data set for environmental contaminants and public health. In particular, biomonitoring information, in vitro data streams and computational toxicology are the crucial factors in the NexGen risk assessment, as well as uncertainties minimisation.

The ENM is first compared to its non-nano form counterpart to determine if ENM-specific assessment is required. Of highest concern from a toxicological perspective are ENMs which have potential for systemic translocation, are insoluble or only partially soluble over time or are particulate and bio- persistent. Where ENM-specific assessment is triggered, Tier 1 screening considers the potential for translocation across biological barriers, cytotoxicity, generation of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory response, genotoxicity and general toxicity. In silico and in vitro studies, together with a sub-acute repeat-dose rodent study,could be considered for this phase.

The maximum residue levels (MRL) for agricultural pesticides are derived from field trials conducted under good agricultural practice (GAP). The MRL is a legally enforceable limit related to GAP.

However, the MRL is not linked to the ADI or ARfD, and could result in intakes considerably below the ADI/ARfD. This disconnection between <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> (ADI/ARfD) and potential exposure assessment (MRL) means that risk characterisation of pesticide residues is less transparent than for other chemicals present in human food.

At present the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) remains the ‘gold standard’ test method for this purpose however non-animal test methods are under development that aim to replace {{the need for new}} animal test data. COLIPA (the European Cosmetics Association) funds an extensive programme of {{skin sensitisation}} research, method development and method evaluation and helped coordinate the early evaluation of the three test methods currently undergoing pre-validation. In May 2010, a COLIPA scientific meeting was held to analyse to what extent skin sensitisation safety assessments for cosmetic ingredients can be made in the absence of animal data. In order to propose guiding principles for the application and further development of non-animal safety assessment strategies it was evaluated how and when non-animal test methods, predictions based on physico-chemical properties (including in silico tools), threshold concepts and weight-of-evidence based <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> could be used to enable safety decisions. Generation and assessment of potency information from alternative tools which at present is predominantly derived from the LLNA is considered the future key research area...|$|E
40|$|This {{review is}} an {{up-to-date}} compilation {{of the available}} literature, including scientific papers, reviews, and EFSA's opinions, on toxicity and risk assessment data on the main marine biotoxins of importance in the European Union, including the legislated ones and the ones of recent appearance which are not legislated. Information about the hazard identification and <b>hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> of okadaic acid, dynophysistoxins, pectenotoxins, yessotoxins, azaspiracids, domoic acid, saxitoxins, tetrodotoxins, brevetoxins, ciguatoxins, cyclic imines and palytoxins is reviewed and presented {{in the form of}} a collection of risk assessments. It is concluded that the importance of having an appropriate exposure assessment reiterates the urgency of establishing a database with representative and comparable data on exposure to food items possiby containing marine biotoxins. It is also concluded that a revision of the present regulation of marine biotoxins in the EU legislation could be considered, as some regulated toxins have been shown not to pose a risk for EU's population (as yessotoxin) and some non regulated toxins have been shown to be harmful and/or to occur in the EU (as tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, and some cyclic imines) while they are not regulated...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the draft {{outline of the}} CORFU Health Impacts Model. The model consists of assessing the risk to human health in four steps:  Hazard identification  <b>Hazard</b> <b>characterisation</b> (or dose-response assessment)  Exposure assessment  Risk characterisation The health impacts model has four components. The first {{of these is the}} risk to human life component, and adapts a model developed in the FLOODsite project to estimate the number of deaths and injuries that could be caused by flooding. The next component relates to waterborne diseases and illnesses that can be assessed by means of a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment. Thirdly, the model takes account of other diseases (such as those transmitted by vectors) and suggests the use of relative risk information to estimate the impact of this disease. A similar approach is suggested to consider the mental health impacts of flooding. Finally, the report describes how the health risks could be characterised using the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). The work described in this publication was supported by the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme through the grant to the budget of CORFU Collaborative Research on Flood Resilience in Urban Areas, Contract 244047...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFoodborne zoonoses have a {{major health}} impact in industrialised countries. New European food safety {{regulations}} were issued to apply risk analysis to the food chain. The severity of foodborne zoonoses and the exposure of humans to biological hazards transmitted by food must be assessed. For meat, inspection at the slaughterhouse is historically the main means of control to protect consumers. However, the levels of detection of biological hazards during meat inspection have not been established in quantitative terms yet. Pork is the most frequently consumed meat in Europe. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide elements for quantifying levels of risk for pork consumers and lack of detection by meat inspection. Information concerning <b>hazard</b> identification and <b>characterisation</b> was obtained by the compilation and statistical analysis of data from 440 literature references. The incidence and severity of human cases due to pork consumption in Europe were assessed in order to calculate risk scores. A ratio of non-control was calculated for each biological hazard identified as currently established in Europe, i. e. the incidence of human cases divided by the prevalence of hazards on pork. Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp. were characterised by high incidence rates. Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Mycobacterium spp. showed the highest severity scores. The three main high risk hazards involved in foodborne infections, Y. enterocolitica, S. enterica and Campylobacter spp. are characterised by high non-control ratios and cannot be detected by macroscopic examination of carcasses. New means of hazard control are needed to complement the classical macroscopic examination...|$|R
40|$|As a {{component}} of its closure operations and to prevent future sinkhole formation, a colliery in Mpumalanga (South Africa) intends to backfill historical bord-and-pillar mining cavities underlying a river. Two backfill products, namely pulverised fly ash (PFA) and coal slurry product are under consideration. Both products were previously shown to have Department of Water Affairs waste <b>characterisation</b> <b>hazard</b> ratings (DWAF, 2005) of HR 3 and HR 4 respectively and classify as permissible backfill materials provided the maximum total load of contaminants is not exceeded. To understand {{the risks associated with}} underground backfilling, a series of investigations were carried out on these two materials to determine their structural integrity and leaching characteristics when exposed to geochemical and groundwater conditions ranging from highly acidic to alkaline. The total analysis of the two backfill products indicated that the elemental composition of the PFA product is dominated by Si>Al> Ca>Fe> Ti> Mg> K> Na> P> SO 4 with minor amounts of other metals such as Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr, Ba and Sr. The composition of the coal slurry product was dominated by Si> Ca>SO 4 > Fe>Mg with minor, but still significant, amounts of F, Ti, K, P, Mn, Sr, Ba, Na and Cr. For each of the two samples, independently, a 30 g mass of crushed backfill material was agitated with 60 ml of distilled water. The suspension was then titrated against 1 M HCl to various pre-determined pH values, noting the volume of acid titrated in each instance. The pH end points for the PFA sampl...|$|R
