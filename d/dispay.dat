40|$|AbstractA set of isoprenylated {{proteins}} {{has been}} detected in rapidly proliferating, suspension-grown murine lymphoma cells. Our {{evidence indicates that}} all of these isoprenylated proteins are phosphorylated. Subsequent to a 24 h incubation with mevinolin to deplete the intracellular mevalonate (MVA) level, cells were incubated with [3 H]MVA and/or 32 Pi and both total cell and subcellular fraction proteins were resolved via 1 - and 2 -D gel electrophoresis, then assessed via subsequent autoradiography. The phospho-isoprenylated proteins comprise a set spanning a molecular mass range of 21 – 69 kDa and all <b>dispay</b> acidic pI. MVA-derivatized proteins of 21 – 24 kDa, which consist of multiple isoforms, are present in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Larger phospho-isoprenylated protein species (44 – 69 kDa) are specifically localized within the nucleus, where applicable extraction protocols indicate that they are part of or closely affiliated with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament (NM-IF) components. The localization of the 69 kDa prenylated species within the NM-IF fraction, together with evidence of its phosphorylation, supports recent indications that this protein is the nuclear matrix component lamin B...|$|E

40|$|The thesis "The {{evolution}} of noun's categories" describes how Latin nouns changed into Italian nouns {{in respect of}} their categories. First of all the {{evolution of}} the latin declension system into Italian classes is discussed. Five latin declensions are reduced to three Italian classes by moving the nouns from the fourth and fifth declensions to the one of three Italian classes. The second chapter deals with the Latin case system which disappeared in the Italian language and it also deals with the reasons for this development. It is shown that the Italian nouns are morphologically invariant and they derive from Latin accusative forms. Then there the expression of the case functions by word order and by the deployment of prepositions is addressed. The number in the noun is discussed in the third chapter where the modern Italian system of number inflection is also described. In this chapter properties of irregular plurals are also described. The class of masculine singular nouns ending in -o, which have the property of <b>dispaying</b> grammatically feminine plurals with inflection identical to that of the first class feminine -a are dealt with in more depth. The fourth chapter focuses on gender which is largely arbitrary both in Latin and in Italian. The problem of gender is first discussed from a pure theoretical [...] ...|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2011. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The design, synthesis and spectroscopic properties of several long wavelength/NIR fluorescent sensors are discussed. Amongst them, the metal complex-indicator sensors are developed based on the indicator-displacement-assay (IDA) strategy; the other BODIPY derived fluorescent sensors are developed based on the indicator-spacer-receptor (ISR) strategy. For the IDA sensors, one [PBA-Zn receptor + ARS] sensor showed some unique dual wavelength patterns when different sugar analytes were introduced. The [Cu complex + Acid Blue 45] sensors have NIR fluorescent properties and displayed high affinity towards various amino acids and warfarin. For the ISR BODIPY sensors, two of the pH responsive sensors have fluorescent emission at 600 nm and displayed appropriate pKas for a physiological environment. One piperazine-BODIPY sensor with a novel structure showed a turn-on NIR fluorescent emission when protonated. One di-(pycolyl) amine-BODIPY sensor <b>dispayed</b> a turn-on NIR fluorescent emission when binding Zn 2 +.

40|$|Both IGF 1 and androgens {{are major}} enhancers of {{prostate}} growth and ire {{implicated in the}} development of prostate hyperplasia and cancer. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether liver-derived endocrine IGF 1 modulates the androgenic response in prostate. Mice with adult, liver-specific inactivation of IGF 1 (LI-IGF 1 (-/-) mice) <b>dispayed</b> an similar to 80 % reduction in serum IGF 1 levels associated with decreased prostate weight compared with control mice (anterior prostate lobe - 19 %, P< 0. 05; dorsolateral prostate (DLP) lobe - 35 % P< 0. 01; ventral prostate (VP) lobe - 47 %, P< 0. 01). Reduced androgen receptor (Ar) mRNA and protein levels were observed in the VP lobe (- 34 % and - 30 % respectively, both P< 0. 05 versus control mice). Analysis of prostate morphology showed reductions in both the glandular and fibromuscular compartments of the VP and DLP lobes that were proportional to the reductions in the weights of these lobes. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced intracellular AR immunoreactivity in the VP and DLP lobes. The non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone increased VP weight to a lesser extent in orchidectomized (ORX) LI-IGF 1 (-/-) mice than in ORX controls (- 40 %, P< 0. 05 versus control mice). In conclusion, deficiency of liver-derived IGF 1 reduces both the glandular and fibromuscular compartments of the prostate, decreases AR expression in prostate, and reduces the stimulatory effect of androgens on VP weight. These findings may explain, at least in part, the well-known clinical association between serum IGF 1 levels and conditions with abnormal prostate growth. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} micropaleontological, geochemical and mineralogical {{study has}} been performed across the mid-Pleistocene sapropel 19 (i-cycle 90) from the Montalbano Jonico land section (southern Italy), to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions at time of its formation. The sapropel interval is characterized by two oxygen depletion phases (phase A and C) interrupted by a temporary re-oxygenation interval (phase B). The {{beginning and the end}} of sapropel deposition is dated at 957 +/- 0. 81 kyr and 950 +/- 0. 86 kyr respectively. The duration of the interruption is estimated to 0. 350 +/- 0. 32 kyr. The multiproxy approach highlights that deposition of sapropel 19 reflects a period of enhanced freshwater runoff induced by a wetter climate. As a consequence of a more efficient fluvial erosion, a higher terrigenous input, mostly ascribable to a southern Apennines source, and an increased turbidity of surface waters accompanied most of saprpel deposition. Biotic and abiotic preoxies document that different paleoenvironmental conditions occur through phases A-C. The beginning of phase A is characterized by warm on-land paleoclimate as well as warm andoligotrophic surface water conditions. During the upper part of phase A temperature starts decreasing and surface waters appear more productive. This change probably represents the prelude to cooler and drier conditions characterizing phase B, which <b>dispays</b> a river supply reduction and an eolian input increase (Sahara dust). During phase C the restored depleted oxygen environment at the bottom sediments is clearly coupled with the re-establishment of humid conditions and increased river supply. At the same time, enhancedmixing of water column, a cooler paleoclimate, and increased productivity of surface waters are recored, the latter likely favored by the enhanced mixing of water column and also increased delivery of land-derived nutrients. The end of phase C is marked by a restored "normal" run-off. Enhanced productivity in surface waters and low oxygen conditions at the bottom sediments persist slightly above phase C. The overall results suggest that the onset of sapropel deposition is related to water stratification that caused low oxygen...|$|R
