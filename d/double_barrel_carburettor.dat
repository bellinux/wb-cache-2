5000|$|The Cortina was {{launched}} {{a few weeks}} before the London Motor Show of October 1962 with a 1,198 cc three-bearing engine, which was an enlarged version of the 997 cc engine then fitted in the Ford Anglia. [...] A few months later, in January 1963, the Cortina Super was announced with a five-bearing 1,498 cc engine. [...] Versions of the larger engine found their way into subsequent variations, including the Cortina GT which appeared in spring 1963 with lowered suspension and engine tuned to give a claimed output of [...] ahead of the [...] claimed for the Cortina 1500 Super. The engines used across the Mark I range were of identical design, differing only in capacity and setup. The formula used was a four-cylinder pushrod (over head valve) design that came to be known as the [...] "pre-crossflow" [...] version as both inlet and exhaust ports were located on the same side of the head. The most powerful version of this engine (used in the GT Cortina) was 1,498 cc (1500) and produced [...] This engine contained a different camshaft profile, a different cast of head featuring larger ports, tubular exhaust headers and a Weber <b>double</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>carburettor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The XZ had a {{displacement}} of 1,219 cc, with a bore of 75 mm and {{a stroke of}} 69 mm. It was powered by a single <b>barrel</b> <b>carburettor,</b> achieving 57 PS (42 kW) at launch, later 64 PS (47 kW) for the Visa Super X. The XZ7R variant used two <b>double</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>carburettors</b> which raised power to 90 PS (66 kW).|$|R
5000|$|In October 1972, {{the more}} {{upmarket}} R12 TS was introduced. It {{used the same}} 1289 cc engine as in other R12s, but was equipped with a single, <b>double</b> <b>barrel</b> Weber <b>carburettor,</b> which increased power to [...] and raised the top speed to 150 km/h. Aesthetically, the car was distinguishable from other R12s by its special Gordini-style wheels, a chrome strip {{along the side of}} the car, and in some countries, two extra headlights. The TS also featured integrated headrests, a tachometer and a cooling-fluid temperature gauge. October 1972 was also when the hand brake lever was relocated from a position ahead of the driver to a floor-mounted location between the front seats. [...] This became possible because now, even on the base [...] "L" [...] version of the car, the front bench seat was replaced by two individual seats.|$|R

5000|$|The AF2011-A1 <b>Double</b> <b>Barrel</b> Pistol comes {{actually}} as {{the very}} first industrial <b>double</b> <b>barrel</b> semiautomatic pistol of all times.

Our idea took the challenge further: to commemorate the legendary Colt 1911-A1 in the Centenary by making a true industrial market-ready <b>double</b> <b>barrel</b> [...]45 caliber pistol. We achieved success in the brief span of 6 months, after intense and round-the-clock 3D designing, stereolithographic modeling and parts machining. Arsenal Firearms AF2011 Description ...|$|R
