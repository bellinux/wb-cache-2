50|$|Although {{geographic}} proximity {{is often}} associated with <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange. In practice, using <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> as an approach to commercial operations - using, recovering and redirecting resources for reuse - results in resources remaining in productive use in the economy for longer. This in turn creates business opportunities, reduces demands on the earth’s resources, and provides a stepping-stone towards creating a circular economy. The <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> model devised and managed by International Synergies Limited is a facilitated model operating at the national scale in the United Kingdom (NISP - National <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> Programme), and at other scales around the world. International Synergies Limited has developed global expertise in IS, instigating programmes in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa and Turkey, as well as the UK. <b>Industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> is a subset of industrial ecology, with a particular focus on material and energy exchange. Industrial ecology is a relatively new field that is based on a natural paradigm, claiming that an industrial ecosystem may behave in a similar way to the natural ecosystem wherein everything gets recycled.|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{classification}} omits any industrial sector-wide {{approaches and}} appreciates {{the diversity of}} the industrial system which is a key feature of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> It is aimed to include initiatives that focus on achieving utility sharing and symbiosis among diverse sectors of industry". It is the diversity and the openness of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> that makes it a unique approach to eco-industrial development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> {{is based on}} mainly {{voluntary}} cooperation of different industries. By conglomerating complementary enterprises and by then adapting their respective production chains, the presence of each may increase viability and profitability of the others. Therefore, symbioses consider resource scarcity and environmental protection as crucial factors in developing sustainable industries and profits. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> often becomes manifest in Eco-industrial parks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> engages {{traditionally}} separate {{industries in}} a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity". The sharing {{of information is}} even more critical {{with the emergence of}} virtual globes such as Google Earth. These tools can greatly simplify the geographical analysis involved in determining potential IS opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|Often the {{location}} of an industry cannot be fully understood solely {{in terms of its}} locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis,</b> when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.|$|E
50|$|She is {{a pioneer}} in the area of <b>Industrial</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> a {{sub-field}} of Industrial ecology that is focused on the shared management of resources by companies in relative geographic proximity. She convened the first international research symposium on <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> in 2004. This meeting brings researchers and practitioners together to discuss current practices and future trends in the field, and is held annually {{in different parts of the}} world. Chertow also serves on the managing board of the Journal of Industrial Ecology., the Editorial Board of BioCycle Magazine, the Board of the Eco-Industrial Development Council, as well as on the Advisory Board of the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. Her work has been mentioned in the press to explain how concepts and scholarship related to industrial ecology and <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> is useful to businesses all over the globe.|$|E
50|$|Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> network {{located in}} Kalundborg, Denmark, in which {{companies}} in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources.|$|E
50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> systems collectively {{optimize}} {{material and}} energy use at efficiencies beyond those achievable by any individual process alone. IS {{systems such as}} the web of materials and energy exchanges among companies in Kalundborg, Denmark have spontaneously evolved {{from a series of}} micro innovations over a long time scale; however, the engineered design and implementation of such systems from a macro planner’s perspective, on a relatively short time scale, proves challenging. Nevertheless, there are examples of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> being approached as national / regional initiatives with some significant success particularly in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Kalundborg Municipality has {{approximately}} 20,000 inhabitants, and {{its network}} {{is the most}} published example of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis.</b> The history of Kalundborg <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> activities began in 1961 when a project was developed and implemented to use surface water from Lake Tisso for a new oil refinery, to save the limited supplies of ground water. The City of Kalundborg took the responsibility for building the pipeline while the refinery financed it. Starting from this initial collaboration, {{a number of other}} collaborative projects were subsequently introduced and the number of partners gradually increased.|$|E

5000|$|Kalundborg {{became an}} {{attractive}} topic in academia {{as well because}} of the obvious sustainability advantages of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of [...] "planned parks" [...] versus [...] "self organized parks". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum {{that the success of}} Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco-industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> {{a subset}} of {{industrial}} ecology. It describes how a network of diverse organizations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change, create and share mutually profitable transactions - and improve business and technical processes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> at Kalundborg was {{not created}} as a {{top-down}} initiative, but instead evolved gradually. As environmental regulations became stricter, firms were motivated {{reduce the cost of}} compliance, and turn their by-products into economic products.|$|E
50|$|Guitang {{maintains}} {{a close relationship}} with farmers by selling them fertilizer in return for high quality sugar cane. Furthermore,the group's commitment to technology and <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> attracts young, well-educated workers to Guangxi who would have otherwise migrated to more developed regions.|$|E
5000|$|Kalundborg's success helped {{generate}} {{interest in}} <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Developed {{nations such as}} the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into implementation of eco-industrial parks (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries within close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) [...] "anchor" [...] tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation). Devens Regional Enterprise Zone {{is a good example}} of a successful EIP in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|It {{appears that}} the concept of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> was not new for the field of {{economic}} geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article [...] "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.|$|E
50|$|The {{petrochemical}} and commodity chemical manufacturing {{units are}} on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.|$|E
50|$|Since then, the {{facilities}} in Kalundborg have been expanding, {{and have been}} sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some {{for the purpose of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> and some out of necessity, for example, freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year.|$|E
50|$|Business waste {{exchange}} {{seeks to}} match the waste of one industry with another industry that uses that waste material, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> This process can help companies increase profitability by reducing raw material and waste disposal cost, reducing carbon emission, making their byproducts a source of revenue to be bought by other business. Repairing old items rather than throwing them away is looked at.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, most {{manufacturing}} may involve significant {{social and environmental}} costs. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for example, may outweigh {{the benefits of a}} product that creates it. Hazardous materials may expose workers to health risks. These costs are now well known and there is effort to address them by improving efficiency, reducing waste, using <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> and eliminating harmful chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{these early}} articles, [...] "Industrial Ecology" [...] {{is used in}} its literal sense - as a system of {{interacting}} industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> on the other hand, is already clearly defined {{as a type of}} industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not {{originally}} planned for <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Its {{current state of}} waste heat and materials sharing developed {{over a period of}} 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment. [...] Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial.|$|E
5000|$|Kalundborg was {{the first}} example of {{separate}} industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as [...] "a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases {{the viability of the}} others, and by which the demans of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered" [...]|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, the {{partners}} realised that they had effectively [...] "self-organised" [...] into what is probably the best-known example of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis.</b> The material exchanges in the Kalundborg region include: conservation of natural and financial resources; reduction in production, material, energy, insurance and treatment costs and liabilities; improved operating efficiency; quality control; improved health of the local population and public image; and realisation of potential income through the sale of by-products and waste materials.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, the President of the American {{association}} {{for the advancement of}} science writes in [...] "The experimental city" [...] that [...] "There are examples of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." [...] The same author in 1970 talks about [...] "The Next Industrial Revolution" [...] The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-industrial symbiosis as a practical way for achieving this: ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{its start}} over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been {{operating}} successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis. As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationships}} among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information. [...] The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that {{use some of the}} material flows. [...] Kalundborg Municipality plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contributetangibly in the exchange.|$|E
50|$|A special {{topic of}} {{ecological}} modernization research during recent years was sustainable household, i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull {{control of supply}} chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing (Braungart and McDonough, 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of social movements {{and the emergence of}} civil society as a key agent of change (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001).|$|E
50|$|The Guitang Group was {{established}} by the Chinese government in 1956 with a sugar refinery and connected alcohol plant that utilized molasses from sugar production. Their original plan was designed to improve their bottom line, but the emission lowering implications soon became evident.Guitang expanded its campus to include three paper mills that use the bagasse (ﬁber residue from the crushing and grinding of raw sugarcane) as raw material along with other facilities to handle downstream waste products. Guitang has maintained {{a close relationship with}} farmers by selling them fertilizer, which in turn allows them to produce higher yielding, better quality sugar cane. In 1997, Guitang was bought by a privately held company, Shenzhen Huaqiang Holdings Ltd. that is dedicated to maintaining Guitang as a model for Chinese <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> Inspired by Guitang, the city of Guigang has enacted a 5-year plan to become an eco-industrial city and improve sugar production efficiency to stay competitive with other sugar producers in the global market.|$|E
50|$|Materials such {{as these}} are made in large scale {{chemical}} manufacturing locations around the world. Not all of the materials are produced in one single location but groups of related materials often are to induce <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. These locations often have clusters of manufacturing units called chemical plants that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, port facilities, road and rail terminals. In the United Kingdom for example there are 4 main locations for commodity chemical manufacture: near the River Mersey in Northwest England, on the Humber on the East coast of Yorkshire, in Grangemouth near the Firth of Forth in Scotland and on Teesside {{as part of the}} Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Approximately 50% of the UK's petrochemicals, which are also commodity chemicals, are produced by the industry cluster companies on Teesside on three large chemical parks at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands.|$|E
50|$|Petrochemicals are {{predominantly}} {{made in a}} few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in Jubail & Yanbu Industrial Cities in Sauid Arabia, Texas & Louisiana in the USA, in Teesside in the Northeast of England in the United Kingdom, in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and in Jamnagar & Dahej in Gujarat, India. Not all of the petrochemical or commodity chemical materials produced by the chemical industry are made in one single location but groups of related materials are often made in adjacent manufacturing plants to induce <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> as well as material and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. This is known in chemical engineering terminology as integrated manufacturing. Speciality and fine chemical companies are sometimes found in similar manufacturing locations as petrochemicals but, in most cases, {{they do not need}} the same level of large scale infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, storage, ports and power, etc.) and therefore can be found in multi-sector business parks.|$|E
5000|$|Green {{information}} system (green IS) {{is a combination}} of environment and information technology (IT). The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed Green Information Technology, which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated. Another effect involves the positive impact of using {{information system}}s (IS) to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society; this is termed green IS. This green IS viewpoint sees IS as a partial solution to many environmental problems. So green IS is a solution for the negative environmental effect of information technology. IS facilitates the reuse of waste and energy and can serve as a tool for <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis,</b> which involves [...] "the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts".|$|E
50|$|Chemical Plants used {{particularly}} for commodity chemical and petrochemical manufacture, {{are located in}} relatively few manufacturing locations around the world largely due to infrastructural needs.This is less important for speciality or fine chemical batch plants. Not all commodity/petrochemicals are produced in any one location but groups of related materials often are, to induce <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. These manufacturing locations often have business clusters of units called chemical plants that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, port facilities, road and rail terminals.

5000|$|Established in 1954 by the state, it {{has since}} become the largest sugar {{refinery}} in China. It began as a standalone sugar refinery, then started employing <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis</b> techniques, and continued for forty years using primarily downstream by-products associated with the production from the sugar production. Afterwards, it made connections with local suppliers of sugar cane, and with local government. The Guitang Group strongly maintains their {{close relationship with the}} sugar farmers, their main suppliers of sugarcane, who are all stationed near or in Guitang City Quality of sugar product is very important to the Group. As of 2003, the Shenzhen Huaqiang Holdings Limited, a private Chinese company, owned all of the entire Guitang Group facilities. The group as a whole, as of 2003, consists of 3800 workers and operates on 14,700 hectares of land. It contains a sugar plant, an alcohol plant, a calcium carbonate plant, a cement plant, a power plant, and several other affiliated units. The non-sugar products account for 40% of revenue and near as much as that in profits and taxes paid. Despite the usually high pollutant-nature of the industries associated with the Group, the strategies employed by the Group have allowed it to meet all local and environmental standards.(figure above from [...] ) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is {{the first}} full {{realization}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>symbiosis.</b> [...] The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through private initiatives, as opposed to government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks. At {{the center of the}} exchange network is the Asnæs Power Station, a 1500MW coal-fired power plant, which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby fish farm, whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer, in addition to Statoil power plant. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum, which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer's gypsum needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of open-pit mining needed. Furthermore, fly ash and clinker from the power plant is used for road building and cement production. These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theories}} about complexity help {{the management of}} an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved {{on the basis that}} living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, {{on the basis of the}} General Systems Theory by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968). Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also productive models with their organizations and management, where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 [...] ). In that field, Cluster Theory (Porter, 1990 [...] ) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like Industrial Ecology (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 [...] ) and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Symbiosis</b> (Chertow, 2000 [...] ). In 1994, Gunter Pauli and Heitor Gurgulino de Souza founded the research institute Zero Emission Research and Initiatives (ZERI), starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem.The design thinking, as Buchanan (1992) said, means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 [...] ), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 [...] ). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a human-centred systems-oriented design practice (Bistagnino, 2011; Sevaldson, 2011; Nelson and Stolterman, 2012; Jones, 2014; Toso at al., 2012 [...] ).|$|E
