5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> work and it is possible that he also identified <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E
5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over two years}} and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E

Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao, and that Đính would soon join. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> palace.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared {{the domination of}} the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

In so doing, he identified <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full {{sovereignty in}} the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.|$|E

The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E
