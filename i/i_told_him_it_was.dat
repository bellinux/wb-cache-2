25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and}} so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E
2500|$|... “Just before {{returning}} to the West, father was invited into our Chapel to listen to the service. [...] He asked me what it was, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] When my father was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school. I was delighted at seeing my father so well treated and recognized. [...] Other chiefs had visited us, but my father was the first Indian to receive such courteous recognition and agreeable presents.|$|E

60|$|WOODER. Visitor who's {{been seeing}} Q 3007 asks {{to speak to}} you, sir. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't usual.|$|R
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. The Church {{is on the}} rocks, {{breaking}} up. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> would {{unless it}} headed for God's open sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> {{not very}} kindly, for his manner was scant civil.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the {{heliograph}} signalling--that it was {{the sign}} of human help and effort in the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "You speak English {{just like}} an Englishman," [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> somehow in my mind to please him. I could hardly have {{explained}} why.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes. He doesn't understand. He's desperately jealous. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter. Will {{you please}} let me hold your hand? I believe I'm {{beginning}} to get the chill.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is laying}} {{plans for the}} new {{settlement}} {{which is to be}} made, and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> would give me pleasure to go with you and Simon Kenton, he said he had other things of which to think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'He seemed greatly surprised,' said Midwinter, 'to {{hear that}} we were going to be married. All he said when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> must be kept a secret was that he {{supposed}} there were reasons on your side for making the marriage a private one.' ...|$|R
60|$|That was the point, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> to be a {{surprise}} for my father; I {{was to take the}} examinations first, and inform him afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you but little. He spoke {{to me on the}} subject, but I stopped him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> none of his business, or of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Derek, it's too awful. I've {{just been}} talking to the man who wrote this play, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the worst thing I had ever seen!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a {{personal}} friend dating back to Rivers' playing days in Atlanta. In the edition of January 12, 2008 of the Boston Globe, Rivers is quoted as saying, [...] "I offered him my apartment... <b>I</b> just <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about Terry and the Red Sox organization. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it's</b> a no-brainer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] faltered Anne; [...] "but I {{would not}} do as he wished. I have given <b>him</b> no troth-plight. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> would never be permitted. And he said no more, but he put this ring on my finger in the boat without a word. I ought not to wear it; I shall not." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> 'ow <b>it</b> was, and {{he stood}} there for some time patting the dog on the 'ead and {{whistling}} under 'is breath.|$|R
60|$|They {{had lost}} the date. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Sunday, the 22nd, he frowned, making some mental calculation, then nodded twice sadly to himself, staring at nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Janet is to {{come over}} for you. However, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite {{unnecessary}} to disturb another old woman, for that I should of course see you home." ...|$|E
6000|$|ATHENE. When Maud {{had gone}} for the cab, I warned him not to use force. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> against the law, but he only said: [...] "The law be damned!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’im</b> ’ow <b>it</b> was, and {{he stood}} there for some time patting the dog on the ’ead and {{whistling}} under ’is breath.|$|R
60|$|Jack's face, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about <b>it,</b> was so woebegone that I felt {{a stab of}} remorse, even in {{the heyday}} of my delight.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know,' said Marriott confidentially, 'he {{asked me}} in, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't good enough. I {{said that if}} he would consent to make his tea with water that wasn't two degrees below lukewarm, and bring on his muffins cooked instead of raw, and supply some butter to eat with them, I might look him up now and then. Otherwise it couldn't be done at the price. But what did he want you for, really?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' said Tancred; {{and then}} he continued, 'I offered him every {{inducement}} to come, for <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to meet you; but perhaps if he had known that you had {{so many things to}} say to him, he might have relented.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{said little}} to me, but {{asked me if}} I cared to walk a little way by this kind of light? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{surprising}} place we were in, but I supposed he would lead me into no danger.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{question}} not of weeks but of months, {{that if we}} were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but neither sooner nor later. [...] "You can calculate for yourself," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "When he {{said that}} Mr. Greystock wasn't a gentleman, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't true. Why did he say it? He knows all about it. Everybody knows. Would you think it wise to come and abuse him to me, when {{you know what he}} is to me? I can't bear it, and I won't. I'll go away to-morrow, if your mamma wishes it." [...] But that going away was just what Lady Fawn did not wish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Abdullah {{would have}} {{assisted}} {{to carry the}} bed in, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>it</b> might hurt his arm, and I and the woman could do it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been false to him. I have been false to myself, but never to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>it</b> was. When you drove me on--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I have often, {{often thought}} of it!" [...] murmured the girl [...] "I have mourned over it, and cried about it in secret for many nights past. He said I looked pale, and ill, and out of spirits to-day, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> with {{thinking}} of that!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{reasonable}} caution in him, and I would assure him that, whatever he said {{should not do}} them any prejudice; and, to convince him of it, I gave him my word that I would not put them to death on any account whatsoever, merely for his sake.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} {{avoiding}} Brown ever since Friday,' said Arthur; 'when he met {{me with a}} serious [...] "Captain Martindale, sir," [...] and threatened me with your being laid up for the year if I kept you here. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his fault for letting you come home so early, and condoled with him on your insubordination.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the blackbeetles. There's {{nothing like}} a {{hedgehog}} for beetles. It will eat blackbeetles till it's sick, till it dies of surfeit. That {{reminds me of the}} time when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> my poor great master Haydon--in joke, of course--that he ought to send in a cartoon of King John dying of a surfeit of lampreys for the frescoes in the new Houses of Parliament. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>it's</b> a most notable event in the annals of British liberty--the providential and exemplary removal of a tyrant." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} my promise to Hester--that promise give by her deathbed. I could not break <b>it,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so. <b>It</b> was the hardest thing I had ever done.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bruce was a lawyer, {{and a very}} respectable man, in whom Mr. Audley felt confidence. He rose at the clergyman's entrance, {{and asked}} {{to speak to him}} in another room, so he was taken into the little back dining-room, and began--'This is a very {{unpleasant}} business, Mr. Audley; this gentleman is very much annoyed, and persuaded that he has a right to carry off his nephew; but as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>it</b> all turns upon the father's expressions. Have you any written authority from him?' ...|$|R
