40|$|Abstract. Many novel {{applications}} {{in the field of}} object recognition and pose estimation have been built relying on local invariant features extracted from selected key points of the images. Such keypoints usually lie on high-contrast regions of the image, such as object edges. However, the visual saliency of the those regions is not considered by state-of-the art detection algorithms that assume the user is interested in the whole image. Moreover, the most common approaches discard all the color information by limiting their analysis to monochromatic versions of the input images. In this paper we present the experimental results of the application of a biologically-inspired visual attention model to the problem of local feature selection in landmark and object recognition tasks. The model uses color-information and restricts the matching between the images to the areas showing a strong saliency. The results show that the approach improves the accuracy of the classifier in the object recognition task and preserves a good accuracy in the landmark recognition task when a high percentage of visual features is filtered out. In both cases the reduction of the average numbers of local features result in high efficiency gains during the search phase that typically requires costly searches of candidate images for matches and <b>geometric</b> consistency <b>checks.</b> ...|$|R

Assume an object is placed on a calibration plate (C-plate) and two perspective views of them are given. The C-plate vertex correspondence, determined by cross-ratios, is used to reduce the search space for determining object vertex/edge correspondence. First, the correspondence of object edges lying on the C-plate (called the object base edges) is considered. This is because the subpolygons obtained from {{the division of the}} C-plate by the extended line of each of these base edges are viewpoint invariant, i. e. the cross-ratio f each of their vertices in different images will have equal value.

40|$|High {{sequence}} identity {{between two}} proteins (e. g. > 60 %) {{is a strong}} evidence for high structural similarity. However, internal shifts {{in one of the}} two proteins can sometimes give rise to unexpectedly high structural differences. This, in turn, causes unreliable structure predictions when two such proteins are used in homology modeling. Here, we perform a computational analysis of helix shifts and we show that their occurrence can be predicted with statistical learning methods. Our results indicate that helix shifts increase the RMS error by factor 2. 6 compared to those protein pairs without a helix shift. Although helix shifts are rare (1. 6 % of helices and a commensurately higher number of proteins are affected), they therefore pose a significant problem for reliable structure prediction systems. In this paper, we prototype a new approach for model quality assessment and demonstrate that it can successfully warn against helix shifts. A support vector machine trained {{on a wide range of}} sequence and structure properties predicts the occurrence of helix shifts with a sensitivity of 74. 2 % and a specificity of 83. 6 %. On an equalized test dataset, this corresponds to an accuracy of 78. 9 %. Projected to the full dataset, it translates to an accuracy of 83. 4 %. Our analysis shows that helix shift detection is a valuable building block for highly reliable structure prediction systems. Furthermore, the statistical learning based approach to helix shift detection that we employ here is orthogonal to well-established model quality assessment methods (which use <b>geometric</b> constraint <b>checking</b> or mean force potentials). Therefore, a further increase of prediction accuracy is expected from the combination of these methods...|$|R
40|$|The vireo group {{participated in}} four tasks: {{instance}} search, semantic indexing, multimedia event detection and known-item search. In this paper,we will present our approaches {{and discuss the}} evaluation results. Instance Search (INS) : We experimented four runs to contrast the following for instance search: full matching (vireo b) versus partial matching (vireo m); use of weak geometric information (vireo b) versus stronger spatial configuration (vireo s); use of face matching (vireo f). - F X NO vireo b 2 : Full keyframe-level matching by Bag-of-Words (BoW) retrieval with weak <b>geometric</b> consistency <b>checking</b> (WGC [19]) as post-processing. - F X NO vireo s 3 : Full matching by BoW retrieval and modeling of spatial configuration using Enhanced WGC (E-WGC [21]) and Geometric-preserving Visual Phrases (GVP [20]). - F X NO vireo f 1 : Full matching by linear fusion of F X NO vireo b 2 with face matching. - F X NO vireo m 4 : Partial matching by weighting the importance of instance and background context. Semantic Indexing (SIN) : For concept detection, one common challenge is the scarcity of training samples. Because there is a significantly increased number of concepts being considered this year, the number of collected training samples per concept is fairly limited. To alleviate this problem, we adopt the Web image sampling algorithm named Semantic Field [10] to enrich the training set provided by TRECVID 2011. Our main focus for the SIN task is {{on the study of}} following two issues: 1) the effectiveness of models learnt from Web images on TRECVID 2011 dataset, and 2) the concept learnin...|$|R
