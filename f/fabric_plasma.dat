It {{is possible to}} produce a steady-state uniform {{glow discharge}} at atmospheric pressure with various gases, thus eliminating the requirement of a vacuum system to expose the materials to plasma. The RF frequency should be set in the limited range to produce AGD: if it is too low, the discharge will not initiate {{and if it is}} too high, the plasma will either form a filamentary discharge between the electrode plates or it will be transformed to arc discharge.

Hence, AGD polymerization may be used to modify the surface properties of Lyocell fabric (acetate taffeta) and polylactic acid (PLA) matrix.

For <b>fabrics,</b> cold <b>plasma</b> treatments require the development of reliable and large systems. Such systems are now existing and the use of plasma physics in industrial problems is rapidly increasing.

Plasma polymerisation, that is the deposition of solid polymeric materials with desired properties on textile substrates, is under development. The advantage of such plasma treatments is that the modification turns out to be restricted in the uppermost layers of the substrate, thus not affecting the overall desirable bulk properties.

40|$|Microscopic {{oriented}} clay bodies {{known as}} plasma separations to soil micromorphologists show {{various degrees of}} symmetry and regularity in their patterns. They could be regarded as sensitive and reliable indicators of stress-strain regime of a soil. Empirical and experimental evidence signifies the importance of stress, specifically that generated by in situ swelling, in the genesis of plasmic fabrics. Hitherto, most work in this field is confined to geometric characterization, with limited attempts to dynamic interpretations of their origin. This paper enlists appropriate concepts in soil mechanics, structural geology and agricultural engineering to interpret the possible stress-strain components that rearrange <b>fabric</b> units into <b>plasma</b> separations. Some pertinent concepts, including physico-chemical behaviour of the clay-water system, shrink-swell phenomenon, stress-strain, deformation and failure of soil, are employed to explain the origin of plasmic fabrics by mechanical principles. A conceptual model is suggested to synthesize the conditions, changes and consequences related {{to the formation of}} plasmic <b>fabrics.</b> Strongly developed <b>plasma</b> separations in natural soils are attributed to the establishment of an anisotropic state of stress generated by in situ swelling, in conjunction with the passive pressure of lateral confinement and vertical overburden. The difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses produces a deviatoric stress that can, at certain stages of a shrink-swell cycle, exceed the shear strength of the soil. The extra stress is relieved plastically by shear deformation which is manifested as the alignment of platy particles in domain configuration by rotation and translation along the shear planes. Soil mainly fails in compressive (plastic) mode along a large number of small shear planes which form the plasma separations. The formation of different types of sepic plasmic fabrics is discussed in relation to the stress-strain regimes of soils. © 1990. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

To overcome the inherent drawbacks of surgical gown from classical fibers of both natural and synthetic origins, polyester micro filament fabric, down to 0. 62 dtex per filament, was used to substitute them. Two major pathways have been chosen to render the surface hydrophobic: - Wet-chemical treatment - Plasma modification For the maximum efficiency of a specific wet-chemical, the following application formulations were found to be best effective: pH = 4 - 5 Drying temperature and time= 100 °C / 90 s Pick-up = 80 % Curing temperature and time= 160 °C / 120 s A range of physical and chemical parameters have been found exerting significant influence on the extent of modification of the material: - Wetting agent - Amount of fluorine content in the chemical - Subsequent heat treatment of the finished material after washing - Ironing of the <b>fabric</b> For the <b>plasma</b> enhanced surface fluorination the following plasma gases were used: - Saturated fluorine compounds: CF 4 and C 2 F 6 - Reducing agent: H 2 and C 2 H 4 The exposure of the substrate to a pure C 2 F 6 discharge resulted in higher hydrophobicity than the substrates exposed to CF 4 plasma. Stepwise increased mixture of H 2 or C 2 H 4 to a proportionally decreased amount of C 2 F 6 plasma showed a gradual decrease in contact angle and a substantial increase in sliding angle values. In addition to the treatments with gas mixtures a two-step technique, i. e., treatment with C 2 H 4 prior to C 2 F 6 plasma, was applied that appeared to be very promising in modifying the surface characteristics. Both, the contact angles and the sliding angles remaining almost constant on a very high level with increasing amount of C 2 H 4 in the feed composition. An essentially vital concern of the work was the characterization of the treatment effect comprising both physical and chemical aspects. By washing the materials for 20 times no significant impairment of hydrophobic character has been noticed in case of fluorocarbon finishing agents {{as well as by the}} surface treated with C 2 H 4 followed by C 2 F 6 plasma (i. e., a two-step technique), wherein a complete loss of hydrophobic effect washing the silicone-treated materials for 10 times was observed.

The consumption of resources like chemicals, energy, water, time for that purpose is considerable. The treatment of cotton fabrics with oxygen-plasma offers the possibility to cut out parts of the conventional wet process without any loss of the hydrophilicity relevant to practical demand.

The choice of suitable materials for the shields and their appropriate arrangement have an essential meaning. Development of lightweight and resistant to environmental exposure shielding materials is possible by using substrates of polypropylene and plasma technology (Ziaja&Jaroszewski, 2011). The shields for suppression of electric field were made in the form of composites of polypropylene unwoven <b>fabrics</b> with deposited <b>plasma</b> layers. Additional advantage of the application of the method is the possibility of plasma cleaning of a fabric surface and modifying its surface properties. The unique properties of pulse plasma make possible to obtain metallic and dielectric coatings on polypropylene fabrics, which are not achievable by standard methods.

H 577 P ITC 2015 LiuXix, 192 pages :color illustrationsTextiles with {{multiple}} functional properties are {{the future of}} the global textile and apparel industry offering new challenges as well as opportunities. A major application of these textiles will be in the field of functional clothing where the consumer is demanding more and more comfort, easy care, health and hygiene {{while at the same time}} expecting protection against mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological attacks. Along with the new functionalities, other desirable properties of finishes include the appearance, feel and durability to laundering. Such complex expectations can only be met by developing new, advanced and innovative technologies for finishing of textile products. To match the requirements of functional fabrics, in this thesis, a systematic study has been carried out to establish active interfaces by grafting polymer brushes on fabrics. These active interfaces are response to moisture, temperature, catalyst, and play as a platform to nanostructures deposition, and several functional fabrics are developed based on the active interface. The knowledge gaps identified in the introduction and literature review have been filled by carrying out the objectives which are summarized below. Firstly, to fill the research gap 1, activated single molecular layer which can both bond fibre with strong adhesion and process reactive chemical groups for further functional polymer brushes growth is developed. Trichlorosilane functionalized initiator for fabric substrates is designed and synthesized. It is proved that polymer brushes could be prepared by combining this designed initiator and the controlled living polymerization on the fabrics' surface,meanwhile commercial 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide is studied as a reference. The influence on two kinds of initiators for controlled growth of polymer brushes on cotton fabrics is investigated and the designed trichlorosilane functionalized initiator showed some advantage with the commercial 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide. To fill research gap 2, based on the activated single molecular layer on fibres, responsive polymer brushes are grown directly by the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), to construct a series of active interface on fibres. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes which can built up thermal-responsive interface with water is selected since its low critical solution temperature (LCST, 31 ~ 35 °C) is similar to the body temperature. The grafted polymer brushes which can responsively and reversibly control the wettability and hygroscopicity of cotton, meanwhile the smart interface can switch from high water absorptive state below its LCST to low absorptive state above its LCST. Smart systems with properties of moisture management and thermoregulation are investigated systematically on human body. To fill research gap 3, a typical polyelectrolyte, poly- 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (PMETAC) brushes are introduced onto the fibre, to form active polymeric interface which can catch catalyst moleculars from solution and fabricate nanoparticles-polymer brushes. The strong adhesion force between resultant metal composites and fibres leading to excellent mechanical and electrical stability under extensive rubbing, bending, stretching,and washing;and the conductivity can remain stable in air with proper choice of metal. To exploit applicability of this type of polyelectrolyte brushes bridged metal nanoparticles deposition on non-natural synthetic <b>fabrics,</b> <b>plasma</b> assistant grafting polymer brushes was developed. Then PMETAC brushes were grown from the active PET surface by surface initiated ATRP, which act as a platform for ELD of copper particles depositing to form polymer-bridges copper-PET hierarchical structures subsequently. This in-situ depositing approach ensures that the copper nanoparticles could distribute uniformly and continuously on the surface of PET fabric structure. As the site selection of polymer brushes, a new printing strategy that allows for the simple fabrication of high-performance flexible, foldable, and stretchable metal conductors on a wide variety of substrates at room temperature is developed. It is compatible with many printing methods by simply tuning the amount of delivering matrix polymer for specific ink requirement, so as to fabricate features with sizes ranging from sub-micrometer, to micrometer,centimeter, and even meter scales. Therefore, MACP is suitable for experimental prototyping (e. g.,using inkjet printing and DPN), as well as high-throughput fabrication (e. g.,screen printing). Therefore,it shows remarkable application potentials for plastic electronics, smart textiles, electronic skins,and biomedical implants and devices. To fill the research gap 4,composite of metal oxide nanoparticles and polymer brushes are integrated by active polymer brushes through interfacial connection. UV functional metal oxide materials, ZnO nanorods,have been electrolessly deposited on cotton fabrics successfully, meanwhile polyelectrolyte brushes play as supported catalyst capture interface. Surface morphological observation reveals that the process leads to the deposition of hexagonal prism crystallites, a characteristic morphology for the ZnO materials. The optical-UV spectroscopy studies indication those ZnO nanorods deposited on fabrics surface show active defense and shelter against UV radiation. The strong adhesion force between composite of ZnO-polymer brushes and fibres offers excellent wash fastness. To fill the research gap 5, fabrics with micro-nano-polymer brushes are developed. Antifouling polymer brushes are grafting on fabrics with multi-brushes structure. Settlement assays with microalgae/zoospores indicated that the multi-scale polymer brushes could successfully repel the settlement of microalgae/zoospores. In future,the testing in both static and dynamic sea water,especially in dynamic sea water will be carried on. Additionally, antibacterial properties of functional fabrics with nano-copper coating which are mentioned in Chapter 4 are also investigated as extension. It shows an important expanded application of copper nanoparticles-polymer brushes composite. By grafting polymer brushes on fibre,a novel system with active interfaces is constructed and shows responses under external stimuli,including temperature, moisture,chemical solution,and plays as platforms to interact with water, metal nanoparticles, pH values, giving smart, intelligent and interactive textiles. The novel strategy of constructing active interface can be employed to impart more functional properties on various fabrics in future. The active interfacial science of fibre established in this thesis bases on assimilation of different sciences and knowledges such as surface chemistry, organic synthesis, polymer science, nanotechnology, lithography, and biology.

40|$|International audiencePoly(hexamethylene adiamide) or nylon 6, 6 fabrics with {{different}} mesh sizes {{were exposed to}} oxygen plasma ignited in a reactive ion etching (RIE) configuration to achieve surface nanostructures and nanoporosity and improved wettability for textile and filtration applications [1]. The effects of plasma power and irradiation time on the samples were observed by performing experiments using constant irradiation time in varying power and using constant power in varying irradiation times. The surface modification was determined by employing characterizations such as contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed improved wettability of nylon 6, 6 <b>fabrics</b> after the <b>plasma</b> treatment. The FTIR spectra of all the treated samples exhibited decreased transmittance of the amide and carboxylic acid groups due to surface etching and surface nanostructures that were observed for the plasma-treated samples on the SEM data. The etching of the surfaces was enhanced for higher power plasma treatments. DSC data showed that the plasma treatment decreased the samples' crystallinity and in consequence increased the amorphous phase of the samples. Surface chemistry showed {{that the effects of}} the plasma treatment on the samples have no significant difference for all the mesh sizes. However, surface morphology showed that the porosity was the same for all the mesh sizes but samples with larger mesh sizes exhibited enhanced etching as compared to the samples with smaller mesh sizes. The plasma-modified nylon 6, 6 samples were then subjected to degradation and stability studies by exposing them to different liquids such as deionized water, alkali, acid, ionic, and organic solvents. The stability tests adapted this the study was a modified protocol defined by Malavasi et al. [2]. The degradation and stability of the material were evaluated by contact angle measurements and FTIR for a specified period of time. Results showed that the fabric exhibited a general increase in chemical resistance to most of the solvents. However, the degradation of the material varies depending on the solvent used...|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2016 Zhouxx, 200 pages :color illustrationsOwing to {{the advance}} in {{hygroscopicity}} and permeability, cotton fabrics are considered as paramount textiles. Just {{because of the}} good hygroscopicity, cotton fabrics are attacked easily by microorganism. This drawback {{can be made up}} by antimicrobial finishing of cotton fabrics. The ideal antimicrobial materials should be regenerable and safe for human and environment. This study investigates the application of nitrogen plasma treatment in antimicrobial finishing processes for cotton fabrics to impart cotton fabrics with regenerable antimicrobial property. In this research, nitrogen plasma treatment used independently to provide antimicrobial finishing for cotton fabrics was firstly studied. Then plasma treatment was combined with pad-dry-cure process of fabrics coated with chitosan and 5, 5 - dimethylhydantoin (DMH), separately. In all of these finishing processes, the fabric was chlorinated with sodium hypochlorite to impart antimicrobial properties and functions. The finishing processes were optimized by an orthogonal array testing strategy (OATS). The influences of parameters, e. g. discharge power of plasma, flow rate of nitrogen, moving speed of fabrics, concentration of finishing agent, curing temperature, concentration of sodium hypochlorite, and time of chlorination, in the antimicrobial finishing processes on the regenerable antimicrobial activity of cotton fabrics were studied. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to characterize the properties of cotton fabric, including concentration of chlorine, morphological properties and functional groups on the cotton fabrics. Tearing strength and weight loss of treated fabrics were also evaluated to study the interaction of plasma treatment with cotton fabrics. The antimicrobial results showed that cotton <b>fabrics</b> treated with <b>plasma</b> independently or finished with the combination processes of plasma and pad-dry-cure process had inhibition of bacteria, Staphylococcus (S. aureus), and the antimicrobial property was regenerable.

40|$|Photo-chemical {{reactions}} and surface modifications of poly(ethylene terephthalate) 100 % (PET) fabrics with active monomer dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA) and benzophenone (BP) as photo-initiator using a broad-band UV lamp source were investigated. The quaternization reactions were initially optimized for homo PDMAPMA, prior to reaction on the PET grafted PDMAPMA chains. The quaternization reaction of homo PDMAPMA {{was confirmed by}} one and two dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1 D and 2 D 1 HNMR), and attenuated total reflection- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) The molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn; poly dispersity index, PDI) of homo PDMAPMA and quaternized homo PDMAPMA with C 8 H 17 Br (C 8) were analyzed by gel permeation chromatograph (GPC). The tertiary amino groups of the grafted polyDMAPMA chains {{on the surface of}} PET fabrics were subsequently quaternized with alkyl bromides of different chain lengths to establish antibacterial activity. The surface composition, structure and morphology of modified PET fabrics were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To evaluate the amount of quaternary and tertiary ammonium groups on the modified surface, PET was dyed with an acid dye (Telon Red AFG) which binds to the ammonium groups. Therefore, the color depth is a direct indicator of the amount of ammonium groups. The amount of positive charges on the surface PET was measured by polyelectrolyte titration and the nitrogen content of the PET-g-PDMAPMA and quaternized PET-g-PDMAPMA was determined. The resulting antibacterial activity of the modified PET fabrics was tested with Escherichia coli. The results of all experiments show that a photochemical modification of PET is possible using DMAPMA, benzophenone and UV light. Also, the quaternization of tertiary amino groups as well as the increase of antibacterial activity of the modified PET by the established quaternary ammonium groups were successful. Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a simple and inexpensive single step synthesis based on UV activation of mixture solution of silver nitrate and poly(methacrylic acid) which acts as stabilizer agent at pH 8. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to prove the occurrence of nanoparticles and the size distribution of the Ag nanoparticle was measured. The UV-VIS spectroscopy revealed the formation of silver NPs by exciting the typical surface plasmon absorption from the UV–Vis spectrum. The mechanism of formation of those silver nanoparticles was also discussed. The streaming potential versus pH curve was negative. Ag NPs colloid was stable at pH values more than 6 (sufficient negative charge is present). The isoelectric point has been observed at pH values of 3. 5 - 4. Silver NPs colloid showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against bacteria such as Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Deposition of silver NPs on the fabrics made from polyester 100 % (PET) and polyamide- 6 100 % (PA) surface was studied by the exhaustion method using a dyeing machine at temperature 80 °C. In order to enhance wettability, the <b>fabrics</b> were <b>plasma</b> pre-treated in air. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed presence of elemental silver on the surface of PET fibers, and silver NPs were well dispersed on the surface as indicated by SEM. The amount of silver particles loaded on the PET and PA 6 samples before and after laundering was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Additionally, the antibacterial activity of the modified fabrics was measured by quantitative and qualitative methods. After the deposition of silver nanoparticles, the fabrics showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity with regard to M. luteus and E. coli. The samples which had been pre-treated by plasma exhibited antibacterial efficacy of the impregnated fabrics with Ag NPs was maintained also after laundering. Moreover, antibacterial efficacy of the impregnated fabrics with Ag NPs was maintained also after many times laundering...|$|R
40|$|The drumlin sediments at Chimney Bluffs, New York {{appear to}} {{represent}} a block-inmatrix style glacial melange. This melange comprises sand stringers, lenses and intraclasts juxtaposed in an apparently massive diamicton. Thin section examination of these glacigenic deposits has revealed microstructures indicative of autokinetic subglacial defonnation which are consistent with a deformable bed origin for the diamicton. These features include banding and. necking of matrix grains, oriented <b>plasma</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{and the formation of}} pressure shadows at the long axis ends of elongate clasts. Preservation of primary stratification within the sand intraclasts appears to suggest that these features were pre-existing up-ice deposits that were frozen, entrained, then deposited as part of a defonning till layer beneath an advancing ice sheet. Multi-directional micro-shearing within the sand blocks is thought to reflect the frozen nature of the sand units in such a high strain environment. It is also contended that dewatering of the sediment pile leading to the eventual immobilisation of the defonning till layer was responsible for opening sub-horizontal fissures within the diamicton. These features were subsequently infilled with mass flow poorly sorted sands and silts which were subjected to ductile defonnation during the waning stages of an actively deforming till layer. Microstructures indicative of the dewatering processes in the sand units include patches of fine-grained particles within a coarser-grained matrix and the presence of concentrated zones of translocated clays. However, these units were probably confined within an impermeable diamicton casing that prevented massive pore water influxes from the deforming till layer~ Hence, these microstructures probably reflect localised dewatering of the sand intraclasts. A layered subglacial shear zone model is proposed for the various features exhibited by the drumlin sediments. The complexity of these structures is explained in terms of ii superposing deformation styles in response to changing pore water pressures. Constructional glaciotectonics, as implied by the occurrence of sub-horizontal fissuring, is suggested as the mechanism for the stacking of the sand intraclast units within the diamicton. The usefulness of micromorphology in complimenting the traditional sedimentology of glacigenic deposits is emphasised by the current study. An otherwise massive diamicton was shown to contain microstructures indicative of the very high strain rates expected in a complexly deforming till layer.. It is quite obvious from this investigation that the classification of diamictons needs to be re-examined for evidence of microstructures that could lead to the re-interpretation of diamicton forming processes.
