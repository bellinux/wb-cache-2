25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid <b>desorbs</b> (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the oxygen}} in Earth's atmosphere, Europa's {{is not of}} {{biological}} origin. The surface-bounded atmosphere forms through radiolysis, the dissociation of molecules through radiation. Solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles (ions and electrons) from the Jovian magnetospheric environment collide with Europa's icy surface, splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen constituents. These chemical components are then adsorbed and [...] "sputtered" [...] into the atmosphere. The same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from the surface, and the balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere. Molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere {{because it has a}} long lifetime; after returning to the surface, it does not stick (freeze) like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather <b>desorbs</b> from the surface and starts another ballistic arc. Molecular hydrogen never reaches the surface, as it is light enough to escape Europa's surface gravity.|$|E

40|$|Solid-phase extractions with {{adsorbents}} like Tenax {{have been}} widely used to assess bioaccessible or bioavailable concentrations and non-extractable residues (NER) of organic contaminants in soils or sediments. This paper presents an analysis of literature rate constants and fractions for rapid, slow and very slow contaminant desorption from soils and sediments. Contaminant fractions <b>desorbed</b> from sediment to Tenax in 6 or 24. h were evaluated as to their adequacy as a proxy for rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fractions, which have been shown to correlate with bioavailable concentrations. Desorption rate constants appear to decrease with increasing contaminant n-octanol-water partition coefficient. The ratio of the fraction of contaminant <b>desorbed</b> from sediment to Tenax in 6. h and the rapidly <b>desorbing</b> fraction appeared to slightly decrease on increasing contaminant hydrophobicity. This was not the case for the extraction for 24. h.

40|$|Ligand I- {{along with}} {{nonionic}} surfactant, Triton X- 100 or anionic surfactant, {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) were applied as soil washing agents to <b>desorb</b> Cd from both naturally and artificially contaminated soils. After seven consecutive washings, up to 90 % of Cd was <b>desorbed</b> from both soils. Triton X- 100 with I- showed a higher capacity to <b>desorbing</b> Cd than did SDS with I-. The increase of ligand concentration was a critical factor for increasing leaching capacity. Without the ligand, surfactant alone could not <b>desorb</b> Cd effectively from either soil. After seven consecutive washings, a sequential extraction experiment was performed for soil residuals to define the soil fraction of Cd removed by the washing agent. Among the washing agents, only Triton X- 100 /I- could remove Cd from the exchangeable fraction of both soils. Various ligands including I-, SCN-, and I-/SCN- in combination with Triton X- 100 were tested for their efficacy in <b>desorbing</b> heavy metals such as Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb from a field contaminated soil. Cadmium was preferentially <b>desorbed</b> by Triton X- 100 /I- whereas Zn and Cu were preferentially <b>desorbed</b> by Triton X- 100 /SCN-. The mixture of I- and SCN- with Triton X- 100 <b>desorbed</b> the most Cd and Cu, but not for Zn, as I- inhibited Zn desorption. Sequential extraction experiments after seven washings showed that metals held in the exchangeable fraction can be <b>desorbed</b> only {{by a combination of}} ligand and surfactant. Nonionic surfactants having different alkyl chain lengths in combination with ligand I- were tested for the desorption of Cd and PCBs from soil. Cadmium desorption was increased at the lower surfactant concentration and higher ligand concentration. The increase in the hydrophilic alkyl chain length of the surfactant adversely affected Cd desorption. Up to 100 % of PCBs were successfully removed by most of surfactant-ligand combinations and the desorption was less dependent, compared to heavy metals, on the concentration of washing agents and length of alkyl chain. The linear relationships between number of washings and Cd desorption, and between alkyl chain length and Cd desorption was defined. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
