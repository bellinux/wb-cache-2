A small study was conducted to examine the effect of varying these methods on the calculated geometric mean <b>diameter</b> <b>by</b> weight (dgw) and geometric standard deviation by weight (sgw).

40|$|The {{effect of}} hammer mill screen size on {{processing}} parameters and particle size of milled sorghum were examined. Sorghum grains were ground through {{two levels of}} hammer mill screen size: 2 mm and 6 mm and then subsequently fractionated by size {{on a set of}} eight sieves ranging from 0. 045 mm to 2. 8 mm.

In the rainfed semi-arid zero tillage system, mean weight <b>diameter</b> obtained <b>by</b> dry <b>sieving,</b> aggregate stability, infiltration, soil moisture content, soil microbial biomass and nutrient status were lower with residue removal than with residue retention. In the irrigated permanent raised bed system, burning of all crop residues resulted in a degradation of soil structure, lower direct infiltration, irrigation efficiency, soil moisture content, soil microbial biomass, lower total N and greater soil sodicity as compared to retaining crop residue at the surface. Practices with partial retention of crop residue showed soil quality similar to practices with retention of all residues.

40|$|CIMMYT is {{committed}} to improving livelihoods in developing countries by increasing the productivity and profitability of farming systems while sustaining natural resources. Conservation agriculture — the use of reduced or zero-tillage, retention of rational amounts of crop residues, and use of viable crop rotations — can reduce production costs and help meet {{the need for more}} economically sound, environmentally friendly, sustainable agricultural production systems for rainfed and irrigated areas. This paper focuses on the influence of tillage and crop residue management on soil quality and includes results from two long-term trials established in the early 1990 ’s in two contrasting agro-ecological systems in Mexico: (1) a low-input, semi-arid, rainfed system in the central highlands with planting on the flat and (2) a high-input, arid, irrigated system in the northwestern Mexico with bed planting. In both systems, zero-tillage with residue retention resulted in higher or comparable yields than the conventional systems and increased soil biological, physical and chemical soil quality. Zero-tillage with residue retention enhanced water availability, soil structure, and nutrient availability more than conventional tillage. Soil microbial diversity increased under zero-tillage with residue retention, facilitating integrated pest management. As well in the rainfed semi-arid zero-tillage system as the irrigated permanent raised bed system, the (partial) retention of the crop residues was necessary to maintain soil quality in zero-tillage systems. The mean weight <b>diameter</b> obtained <b>by</b> dry <b>sieving,</b> aggregate stability, infiltration, irrigation water use efficiency, soil moisture content, soil microbial biomass, micro-flora diversity, micro-flora activity and nutrient status were lower with residue removal than with residue retention. Soil erosion and sodicity increased with residue removal or burning as compared to retaining crop residue at the surface. In light of these results, the underlying principles of conservation agriculture should provide the foundation upon which the development of new agronomic practices is based. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Apart {{from a few}} using cut aphid stylets, no {{attempts}} have been made thus far to measure in vivo sucrose-uptake properties of sieve elements. We investigated the kinetics of sucrose uptake <b>by</b> single <b>sieve</b> elements and phloem parenchyma cells in Vicia faba plants. To this end, microelectrodes were inserted into free-lying phloem cells in the main vein of the youngest fully-expanded leaf, half-way along the stem, in the transition zone between the autotrophic and heterotrophic part of the stem, and in the root axis. A top-to-bottom membrane potential gradient of sieve elements was observed along the stem (- 130 mV to - 110 mV), while the membrane potential of the phloem parenchyma cells was stable (approx. - 100 mV). In roots, the membrane potential of sieve elements dropped abruptly to - 55 mV. Bathing solutions having various sucrose concentrations were administered and sucrose/H+-induced depolarisations were recorded. Data analysis by nonlinear least-square data fittings as well as by linear Eadie-Hofstee (EH) -transformations pointed at biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics (2 MM, EH: Km 1 1. 2 - 1. 8 mM, Km 2 6. 6 - 9. 0 mM) of sucrose uptake <b>by</b> <b>sieve</b> elements. However, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) favoured single MM kinetics. Using single MM as the best-fitting model, Km values for sucrose uptake <b>by</b> <b>sieve</b> elements decreased along the plant axis from 1 to 7 mM. For phloem parenchyma cells, higher Km values (EH: Km 1 10 mM, Km 2 70 mM) as compared to sieve elements were found. In preliminary patch-clamp experiments with sieve-element protoplasts, small sucrose-coupled proton currents (- 0. 1 to - 0. 3 pA/ pF) were detected in the whole-cell mode.
