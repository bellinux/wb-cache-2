500|$|Super Mario 64 is {{the first}} game to have a [...] "free" [...] camera that can be {{controlled}} independently of the character. Most 3D games from the time use a first-person perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic {{system in which the}} video camera is operated by the in-game character Lakitu. The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. Nintendo Power stated the camera-control scheme is what transitioned platform games into three dimensions, and that the game, along with , [...] "blazed trails" [...] into the 3D era. Along with camera control, the game also innovated in its implementation of movement. Edge stated the game changed [...] "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The Nintendo 64's analog stick allows for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles, and Super Mario 64 uses this {{in a way that was}} unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. Super Mario 64s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. Super Mario 64 was one of the first games to implement the system.|$|E

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ fluid amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. Fluid amplifiers {{rely on a}} <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> stream to switch a fluid power stream. Fluid amplifiers are so named because a low-energy <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> signal can control and switch a high-energy fluid power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> signal. In fluid amplifiers, a fluid power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying <b>fluid</b> <b>control</b> pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit end of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid pressure imbalance adjacent the exit end of the nozzle to effect switching of the fluid power stream.|$|E
