40|$|Through {{an initial}} {{survey of the}} impact of the {{exposure}} to the noise from high- speed hand dryers in publically accessible toilets, Drever’s research uncovered a wide range of vulnerable groups that due to the sensitivity of their hearing or particular <b>hearing</b> <b>requirements</b> led to elevated anxiety, fear, pain and confusion and were in some cases exacerbating their social avoidance. These groups included infants; the elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with dementia, cerebral palsy, Ménière's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. The cause of this noise issue is a combination of product design, architectural design, and complete lack of guidance and standards regarding toilet provision and acoustics and noise control. On the other hand the lack of acoustic privacy provided by a certain level of background noise can lead to a range of health issues including paruresis and parcopresis. Through interviews Drever has followed up this research with a wider study on the impact of everyday urban noise on these vulnerable groups. The study raises pressing accessibility issues related to education, the workplace and access to the public sphere in general.

Design: In this prospective study, the headband was introduced after assessment confirmed suitable candidacy. Those who had an initially favourable response to the headband trial were encouraged to complete a 2 -week home trial of device and headband. Patients were asked to {{pay special attention to}} situations where they perceived high demands on their hearing, e. g. at the dinner table, in the car, walking outside etc. Counselling regarding the BAHA placement, the need for daily care of the implant site and the financial implications of acquiring the device was also given. Setting: Tertiary university hospital. Participants: Patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, fulfilling criteria for BAHA surgery, with favourable response to initial 'office trial' of headband. Main outcome measures: After 2 -week home trial, BAHA and headband were returned with a statement of the patient's intentions. Results: Sixteen of 50 (32 %) patients who expressed definite interest in BAHA surgery after a positive introduction to the headband in the office did not wish to proceed to surgery having completed a more thorough 2 -week trial of device at home. Most patients cited a failure of the device to meet their <b>hearing</b> <b>requirements.</b> Subsequently, we found further attrition with nine more patients (18 %) deciding at a still later date, not to proceed with surgery. Ultimately, just 25 of 50 (50 %) of our initially enthusiastic group chose not to proceed to surgery. In the group who did proceed, there were no non-users. Conclusions: We propose the importance of an extended preoperative trial where BAHA is considered in the rehabilitation of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The trial may foster more realistic expectations of device performance in this challenging group. A 'cooling-off' period before surgery also appears to lead to further attrition with the ultimate reward of no non-users in those proceeding to surgery...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade and a half, there has been {{significant}} recognition of the legal rights of children and increasing attention to the law governing those rights. In addition to voluminous law review literature and treatment in texts, the United States Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and the state courts have addressed issues relating to children 2 ̆ 7 s rights in an expanding number of cases. Among the areas that the courts have scrutinized are children 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of expression under the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States, <b>hearing</b> <b>requirements</b> before a student may be suspended from a public school or subjected to a disciplinary transfer, the rights of students summarily expelled from schools to sue for damages, corporal punishment of students, free access by minors to contraceptive devices, the right of a child to secure an abortion without parental consent, and the right of a minor to a hearing before commitment to a state mental hospital. Recently, the focus of attention has shifted to children 2 ̆ 7 s noncriminal misbehavior, which is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts through statutes proscribing such conduct as truancy, running away from home, incorrigibility, ungovernability or waywardness, leading an idle or dissolute life, or being beyond parental control or habitually disobedient. The courts 2 ̆ 7 exercise of this jurisdiction has been subjected to several lines of attack. Critics charge that statutory definitions of the behavior or circumstances that trigger juvenile court jurisdiction over noncriminal misbehavior of children are hopelessly vague and overbroad, that the exercise of the jurisdiction unconstitutionally punishes a status, that an adjudication under the applicable statutes labels and 2 ̆ 2 stigmatizes 2 ̆ 2 the respondent child, and that exercise of the jurisdiction is an example of racial and economic discrimination. In sum, critics argue that the assertion of jurisdiction by juvenile courts over noncriminal misbehavior of children is not only fraught with constitutional problems, but also fails to serve any legitimate interest of the state and is not a valid exercise of the state 2 ̆ 7 s power. These attacks have culminated in the demand that the jurisdiction be abolished in order that children who engage in conduct that would not be criminal if committed by an adult would be free of the coercive power of the juvenile courts...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{years ago}} I waxed lyrical on the deep, {{indelible}} ties {{of the sounds}} of Dartmoor with its inhabitants (Drever 2002), betraying an inclination towards what Sterne’s has called the audio-visual litany (Sterne 2003). In this endeavour I added a sonic turn to Tuan’s concept of topophilia (Tuan 1974) : “fleeting visual pleasure; the sensual delight of physical contact; the fondness for place because it is familiar, because it is home and incarnates the past, because it evokes pride of ownership or of creation; joy in things because of animal health and vitality. " My notion of topophonophilia stressed the affirmative relationships between place, the sensation of sound and sentiment. Those of us who research and practice soundscapes, tacitly extol the positive attributes of sound and hearing with relation to space and place. We talk of how through sound we connect, locate, embody, discern and immerse. Through my recent research I am urged to propose that the opposite is also a reality: sound isolates, excludes, disconnects, disembodies and dislocates from the material and social world. Through {{a study of the}} impact of noise from high-speed hand dryers, my research uncovered a wide range of vulnerable groups that due to the sensitivity of their hearing or particular <b>hearing</b> <b>requirements</b> led to elevated anxiety, fear, pain and confusion and were in some cases exacerbating their social avoidance. These groups included infants; the elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with dementia, cerebral palsy, Ménière's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. In the case of autism exposure to noise can even lead to a shutdown. Following on from this study I came across an extensive range of environmental sounds that are causing suffering to these groups: bird scarers, mosquito alarm, classroom noise, traffic noise, waves on a beach and even the dawn chorus. With reference to Beethoven, Grandin, Canetti, Kafka and Noël Coward as well as new interview material, this paper will explore the sensory threshold shift of the sensitive hearer, and the sensitising of hearing, including the use of sonic thresholds to control subgroups. In conclusion, I propose a new paradigm for understanding hearing that extends from a medical classification of the otologically normal to a socio-cultural conception of the auraltypical. Within what I see as the hegemony of the auraltypical, I call for a new agenda of auraldiversity within acoustics and sound studies...|$|E

Famously attributed to author Mark Twain, but never authenticated. ] But {{what happens when}} the only opponent is the rightful owner? With closing notices in hand, Gerard Keating and his neighbors asked themselves that same question. The Nebraska Department of Natural Resources issued closing notices to Keating and many other appropriators in Holt County, Nebraska, when stream flow in the Niobrara Watershed had become insufficient to satisfy the water needs of all surrounding appropriators. Instead of taking advantage of the postdeprivation hearing offered by the Department of Natural Resources, Keating and the other appropriators filed suit, claiming that Nebraska’s established water administration system violated their due process rights. Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found no due process violation of the appropriators’ rights, simply because the appropriators do not have a property interest in the waters of the state, which includes the Niobrara Watershed. To clarify the arguments discussed in Keating, this Note first provides an overview of Nebraska water administration, followed by a discussion of the property rights vested in public waters. This Note then analyzes the impracticality of predeprivation hearings for water administration, the state’s interest in quick administration of water use, and the challenge of providing sufficient due process while also preserving the water administration system. This Note then provides an overview of Keating and related case law. Thereafter, there is a discussion of the United States Supreme Court decisions which have ruled that a predeprivation hearing is necessary, and why those situations are inapplicable to the administration of water use. This discussion also describes established exceptions to the predeprivation <b>hearing</b> <b>requirement</b> and how Nebraska’s appropriation system does not violate due process. Finally, this Note concludes with how Keating’s and other similarly situated plaintiffs’ challenges to the water administration system are a result of misplaced expectations in appropriation permits and the minimal property rights held therein...|$|R

40|$|Circular saws are {{widespread}} {{tools for}} machining metal, wood or even ceramics. Due to the thin blade and excitation by the workpiece contact of the cutting edges, circular saws {{are prone to}} vibration and intense noise emission. Damping the blade will lower the <b>hearing</b> protection <b>requirements</b> of the users and possibly increase precision. Therefore a new damping concept for circular saw blades is presented in this paper. It is based on negative capacitance shunted piezoelectric transducers which are applied to the saw blade core. The required energy for the electronics is harvested from the rotation by a generator, so that no change of the machine tool is required. All components are integrated into an autonomous saw tool. Finally, the system is experimentally investigated without rotation, in idling and in cutting condition in a circular saw test stand in the Institute for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (IWF) at TU Braunschweig. The experimental investigation shows a good reduction of the vibration amplitude over a wide frequency range in the non-rotating condition. When rotating, the damping effect is lower and limited to some narrow frequency bands. The proposed reason for the reduced damping effect in rotating condition consists in the saturation of the electronic circuits due to the limited supply voltage capabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to test the quality of data {{collected}} by a mobile hearing screening application (hEAR) against the gold standard of pure tone audiometry administered by a certified audiologist. hEAR used 7 pre-set frequencies (125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz), which were the independent variables, and recorded measurements as sound pressure levels in decibels (dB) during three trials. In total, 30 subjects were recruited {{from the general population}} at Texas A&M University. Subjects were randomly assigned and counterbalanced in their assignment to a ?quiet? room and a ?noisy? room. Subjects used the hEAR mobile hearing screening application to self-administer hearing screening tests. Subjects also had hearing screening examinations performed by a certified audiologist at the identified pre-set frequencies. Data were analyzed using a mixed effect model and testing for repeated measures at 95 % confidence intervals, results were separated by room.

Despite the mandatory <b>hearing</b> protection <b>requirements</b> for a job of this caliber, there still remains a chance of an over exposure to noise. Most of the exposure comes from the different types of loud repair equipment and tools, but the greatest exposure comes from a jet engine that can reach 140 decibels. Flight maintenance personnel often work in an environment where the hours are long and there is continuous noise at high decibels. Flight maintenance personnel are typically in multiple places throughout a workday because of the maintenance responsibilities of different equipment, trucks, and planes. This study will examine the noise exposure levels of the service members in the Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) department on a United States Air Force base. The study will help determine if the service members in the AGE department are being over exposed to noise from their daily routines as flight repair personnel. There has been previous noise sampling done on the AGE department and there will be a comparison of data due to different equipment, change in personnel, and standard operating procedures for the department. The bioengineering/ environmental department is typically responsible for sampling of the AGE department. They have had a difficult time with suggesting engineering controls due to the constant mobility of the maintenance crews. As a result, they have to rely heavily on administrative controls and effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This study will include sampling for a standard workday including day and night shift for the AGE department. The sampling will be done by using personal noise dosimeters and a sound level meter will be used to conduct area sampling for equipment in AGE shop. The AGE department on the Air Force base agreed to allow personnel from their shop to participate in this study. In this study, we will adhere to the Air force safety regulations and sampling technique...|$|R
