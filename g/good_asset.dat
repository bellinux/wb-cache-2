40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a self-fulfilling price cycle in an asset market. Price oscillates deterministically even though the underlying environment is stationary. The mechanism that we uncover is driven by endogenous variation in the investment horizons of the different market participants, informed and uninformed. On even days, the price is high; on odd days it is low. On even days, informed traders are willing to jettison their <b>good</b> <b>assets,</b> knowing that they can buy them back the next day, when the price is low. The anticipated drop in price more than offsets any potential loss in dividend. Because of these asset sales, the informed build up their cash holdings. Understanding that the market is flooded with <b>good</b> <b>assets,</b> the uninformed traders are willing to pay a high price. But their investment horizon is longer than that of the informed traders: their intention is to hold the assets they purchase, not to resell. On odd days, the price is low because the uninformed recognise that the informed are using their cash holdings to cherry-pick <b>good</b> <b>assets</b> from the market. Now the uninformed, like the informed, are investing short-term. Rather than buy-and-hold as they do with assets purchased on even days, on odd days the uninformed are buying to sell. Notice that, {{at the root of the}} model, there lies a credit constraint. Although the informed are flush with cash on odd days, they are not deep pockets. On each cherry that they pick out of the market, they earn a high return: buying cheap, selling dear. However they don't have enough cash to strip the market of cherries and thereby bid the price up...|$|R

While APT activities are stealthy and hard to detect, the command and control networktraffic associated with APT can be detected at the network layer level. Deep log analyses and log correlation fromvarious sources can be useful in detecting APT activities. Agents can be used to collect logs(TCP and UDP) directly from assets into a syslog server. Then a Security Information and Event Management(SIEM) tool can correlate and analyze logs. While it is challenging to separate noises from legitimate traffic, a goodlog correlation tool can be used to filter out the legitimate traffic, so security staffcan focus on the noises.

50|$|Thus, if we {{took the}} final price of a good (the cost to the final consumer) and {{analysed}} the cost structure of that good, we might find that, {{over a period of}} time, the direct producers get less income and intermediaries between producers and consumers (traders) get more income from it. That is, control over the access to a <b>good,</b> <b>asset</b> or resource as such may increasingly become a very important factor in realising a surplus-value. In the worst case, this amounts to parasitism or extortion. This analysis illustrates a key feature of surplus value which is that it accumulated by the owners of capital only within inefficient markets because only inefficient markets - i.e. those in which transparency and competition are low - have profit margins large enough to facilitate capital accumulation. Ironically, profitable - meaning inefficient - markets have difficulty meeting the definition a free market because a free market is to some extent defined as an efficient one: one in which goods or services are exchanged without coercion or fraud, or in other words with competition (to prevent monopolistic coercion) and transparency (to prevent fraud).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple model of {{financial}} crises, {{which may be}} useful for the unified analysis of macro and financial policies implemented during the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis. A financial crisis is modeled as a disappearance of inside money due to the lemon problem à la Akerlof (1970), in a simplistic variant of Lucas and Stokey’s (1987) Cash-in-Advance economy, where both cash and capital stocks work as media of exchange. The exogenous emergence of huge amount of bad assets represents the occurrence of a financial crisis. Information asymmetry regarding the <b>good</b> <b>assets</b> (capital stocks) and the bad <b>assets</b> causes the <b>good</b> <b>assets</b> to cease functioning as inside money. The private agents have no proper incentive {{to dispose of the}} bad assets and the crisis could be persistent, because the lemon problem is an external diseconomy. Macroeconomic policy (e. g., fiscal stimulus) provides outside money for substitution, and financial stabilization (e. g., bad-asset purchases) restores the inside money by resolving information asymmetry. The welfare-improving effect of the macro policy may be nonexistent or temporary, while the bad-asset purchases may have a permanent effect to shift the economy out of the crisis equilibrium.

5000|$|Davro is one {{of several}} comedians or comic actors to be given a role in EastEnders, a {{tradition}} that goes back to 1987, when comedian Mike Reid was cast as Frank Butcher. The casting of a comedian in a dramatic role was highly controversial at the time, but over the years the wisdom of that decision was proved, as Frank became one of the show's most popular and iconic characters. Other comic actors featured in EastEnders include Barbara Windsor (known for her roles in Carry On films) as Peggy Mitchell, and entertainer Shane Richie, who played Alfie Moon.
