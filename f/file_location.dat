FireEye noticed that the protocols and strings previously used were changed in June 2014. The researchers at FireEye believe this change was to help the malware evade further detection. FireEye named this new version of Etumbot HighTide. Numbered Panda continued to target Taiwan with spear phishing email campaigns with malicious attachments. Attached Microsoft Word documents exploited the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to help propagate HighTide. FireEye found that compromised Taiwanese government employee email accounts were used {{in some of the}} spear phishing.

40|$|Many quality {{aspects of}} {{software}} systems are {{addressed in the}} existing literature on software architecture patterns. But the aspect of system administration {{seems to be a}} bit overlooked, even though it is an important aspect too. In this work we present three software architecture patterns that, when applied by software architects, support the work of system administrators: PROVIDE AN ADMINISTRATION API, SINGLE <b>FILE</b> <b>LOCATION,</b> and CENTRALIZED SYSTEM LOGGING. PROVIDE AN ADMINISTRATION API should solve problems encountered when trying to automate administration tasks. The SINGLE <b>FILE</b> <b>LOCATION</b> pattern should help system administrators to find the files of an application in one (hierarchical) place. CENTRALIZED SYSTEM LOGGING is useful to prevent coming up with several logging formats and locations. Abstract provided by the authors.

40|$|Abstract—The major {{objective}} of the Service Oriented Computing Environment (SORCER) is to form dynamic federations of network services that provide shared data, applications, and tools on a service grid along with exertion-oriented programming. To {{meet the requirements of}} these services in terms of data sharing and managing in the form of data files, a corresponding federated file system was developed. The file system fits the SORCER philosophy of interactive exertion-oriented programming, where users create service-oriented programs and can access data files in the same way they use their local file system. The federated file system provides data redundancy in the form of file replication. However, there is no efficient management of these file replicas after creation and the location to which they are replicated to is not taken into account. Thus, a separate <b>File</b> <b>Location</b> Management Framework was developed to fit with the SORCER metacomputing philosophy and to manage autonomically file replication.
