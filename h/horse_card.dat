Major differences the Italian Camorra relies mainly on extortion and racketeering, whereas Greek organised crime relies mainly on smuggling.|$|R
50|$|The king card is {{the oldest}} and most {{universal}} court card. It most likely originated in Persian Ganjifeh where kings are depicted as seated on thrones and outranking the viceroy cards which are mounted on <b>horses.</b> Playing <b>cards</b> were transmitted to Italy and Spain via the Mamluks and Moors. The best preserved and most complete deck of Mamluk cards, the Topkapı pack, did not display human figures but just listed their rank most likely due to religious prohibition. It is not entirely secure if the Topkapı pack was representative of all Mamluk decks as it was a custom-made luxury item used for display. A fragment of what may be a seated king card was recovered in Egypt which may explain why the poses of court cards in Europe resemble those in Persia and India.|$|R

While presenting horses, judges may introduce themselves to the rider and answer any questions they might have. Most competitions have two or more judges, the horsemanship judge {{is looking for a}} rider who is attentive to the horse and to the vet judge. The vet judge assesses the condition of the horses to establish a baseline. The horse that looks as good on the last day as it did on the first day will score well. Blemishes, scars, and marks are noted. Points are not taken off for blemishes or minor cuts at check-in and are scored at checkout only if they are worse. The exception to this is soundness, which can be scored off at check-in, and if severe, may disqualify the horse from competition. The judge also notes if the horse will stand quietly for examination and allow its feet to be picked up, and this behavior is scored under manners on the <b>horse's</b> score <b>card.</b> At ACTHA events there are 6 judges. The horse and rider are judged in trail only. There isn't a vet judge although vet and farrier services are normally near by.|$|R

60|$|Thenceforth, while Wrangle sped on, Venters glued {{his eyes}} to the little rider. Jerry Card rode as only he could ride. Of all the daring {{horsemen}} of the uplands, Jerry was the one rider fitted to bring out the greatness of the blacks in that long race. He had them on a dead run, but not yet at the last strained and killing pace. From time to time he glanced backward, as a wise general in retreat calculating his chances and the power and speed of pursuers, and the moment for the last desperate burst. No doubt, Card, with his life at stake, gloried in that race, perhaps more wildly than Venters. For he had been born to the sage and the saddle and the wild. He was more than half horse. Not until the last call--the sudden up-flashing instinct of self-preservation--would he lose his skill and judgment and nerve and the spirit of that race. Venters seemed to read Jerry's mind. That little crime-stained rider was actually thinking of his horses, husbanding their speed, handling them with knowledge of years, glorying in their beautiful, swift, racing stride, and wanting them to win the race when his own life hung suspended in quivering balance. Again Jerry whirled in his saddle and the sun flashed red on his face. Turning, he drew Black Star closer and closer toward Night, till they ran side by side, as one <b>horse.</b> Then <b>Card</b> raised himself in the saddle, slipped out of the stirrups, and, somehow twisting himself, leaped upon Black Star. He did not even lose the swing of the horse. Like a leech he was there in the other saddle, and as the horses separated, his right foot, that had been apparently doubled under him, shot down to catch the stirrup. The grace and dexterity and daring of that rider's act won something more than admiration from Venters.|$|R
40|$|Young {{people are}} a high risk group for {{gambling}} problems and university (college) students fall into that category. Given the high accessibility of gambling in Australia and its association with entertainment, students from overseas countries, particularly those where gambling is restricted or illegal, may be particularly vulnerable. This study examines problem gambling and its correlates among international and domestic university students using a sample of 836 domestic students (286 males; 546 females); and 764 international students (369 males; 396 females) at three Australian universities. Our findings indicate that although most students gamble infrequently, around 5 % of students are problem gamblers, a proportion higher than that in the general adult population. Popular gambling choices include games known {{to be associated with}} risk (<b>cards,</b> <b>horse</b> races, sports betting, casino games, and gaming machines) as well as lotto/scratch tickets. Males {{are more likely to be}} problem gamblers than females, and almost 10 % of male international students could be classified as problem gamblers. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that male gender, international student status, financial stress, negative affect and frequency of gambling on sports, horses/dogs, table games, casino gaming machines, internet casino games and bingo all significantly predicted problem gambling. Results from this study could inform gambling-education programs in universities as they indicate which groups are more vulnerable and specify which games pose more risk of problem gambling. <br /...|$|R

Australian Collegge of Veterinary Scientists Conference Paper July 1 - 3 2010. Endometritis {{has been reported}} to be the third most common medical condition of <b>horses</b> (<b>Card,</b> 2005) and is an important cause of reduced fertility in mares (Hurtgen, 2006) in particular {{the most common cause of}} embryonic loss before day 35 in normally cycling mares (Knottenbelt, 2003). Previous reports in the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of endometritis in the mare are contradictory and opinions vary considerably (Liu and Troedsson, 2008). Uterine bacteriology with cytology has long been reported to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying mares with endometritis (Wingfield Digby and Ricketts, 1982) and at risk of reduced 28 day pregnancy rates (Riddle et al., 2007), however, studies have failed to investigate the use of uterine bacteriology and cytology and their predictive value with regard to live foal rates. Material and Methods: Guarded swabs for uterine endometrial cytology and bacteriology were simultaneously collected from 1614 mares on 17 stud farms in the Hunter Valley region of NSW by 5 veterinarians at Scone Equine Hospital during the 2008 breeding season. All mares, including maiden (181), foaling (1059), barren (306) and problem (67) had a swab taken for cytological and bacteriological analysis at the beginning of the season prior to covering. The 1614 mares were further broken down into age groups as follows: Group A (young 3 - 8 years), group B (middle aged 9 - 13 years), group C (old mares 14 - 18 years) and group D (oldest mares > 18 years). The swabs were transported to the laboratory at Scone Equine Hospital on the same day as collection. Cytology was classified as non-inflammatory 0 - 5 % neutrophils, mild inflammation 5 - 15 % neutrophils, moderate inflammation 16 - 30 % neutrophils and severe inflammation > 30 % neutrophils (Card, 2005). Bacterial growth was classified as no growth, mixed flora (2 or more organisms) or positive (for one bacterial isolate only). Swabs that had a cytological presence of > 10 % neutrophils and no bacterial growth were also put in cooked meat medium and cultured anaerobically for 72 hours in order to identify possible anaerobic pathogens. Pregnancy outcome was classified as missed, slipped (in accordance with Australian stud book definitions) or live foal. Pearson?s ?? analysis (Genstat) was used for statistical analysis throughout, a p value of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Age group was significantly (p < 0. 001) associated with pregnancy outcome, live foal rates varying between the young (76 %), middle aged (74 %), old (65 %) and oldest mares (31 %). There was a significant (p< 0. 001) association between reproductive status and pregnancy outcome, with foaling rates varying between 77 % for maiden mares and 61 % for problem mares. 1518 (94 %) of the 1614 paired cytological and bacteriological samples were normal (< 5 % neutrophils and no growth). These control mares had a live foal rate of 74 %, 19 % missed and 7 % slipped. There was a significant association (p< 0. 005) between positive bacterial growth and decreased pregnancy rates. Of these positive mares 56 % had a live foal, 40 % missed and 4 % slipped. The major contributors to the positive category were beta haemolytic streptococci (62 %) with a live foal rate of 71 % and Escherichia coli (12 %) with a live foal rate of 17 %. There was no significant association between mixed bacterial flora and inflammation or live foal rates though they were lower (71 %) compared to controls; 22 % mares missed and 7 % slipped. There was a significant (p< 0. 05) association between inflammation and live foal rate. Mares that fell into the mild inflammatory category had a live foal rate of only 33 %, while the overall percentage for mares with mild, moderate or severe inflammation having a live foal was 61 %. There was a positive association (p< 0. 05) between mares that had a positive swab, inflammatory cytology and pregnancy outcome, with poorer live foal rates for these mares (53 %), with 41 % of mares classified as missed and 6 % as slipped. Discussion: Individually both uterine bacteriology and cytology are diagnostic in predicting pregnancy outcome, as mares with either a positive culture or inflammation on cytology had lower live foal rates than the control group. However, they are most prognostic when used together and mares with an inflammatory cytology and positive bacteriology were the least likely to produce a live foal (53 %). Our data did not support the finding of Riddle et al., which stated that all mares with two or more organisms (mixed flora) isolated in the uterus had moderate or severe inflammation on cytological analysis. The type of pathogen isolated is important with a live foal rate of only 17 % in mares with Escherichia coli isolated. Sampling techniques used in this study were viewed to be successful as only 2. 7 % of swabs were hypocellular yielding inadequate epithelial cells to allow analysis (hypocellular results indicate poor/inadequate swabbing technique). Mares with a mild inflammatory response had a disproportionally low number of live foals, it is thought that these mares may not have been viewed as high risk and therefore not treated as aggressively as mare with moderate and severe inflammation or may have developed post breeding endometritis. Analysis of the data is ongoing and further research is being undertaken to assess such things as the predictive value of the intermediary and last mare swab versus first mare swab in repeat breeders and the possibility of creating a predictive equation for live foal rates based on mare age, reproductive status, and uterine bacteriology with cytology.
