5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was used to patrol the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight,</b> a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were {{attempting}} to clear British-laid minefields in the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand {{was attached to the}} 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> New Zealand did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, on 28 August 1914, Moltke participated in the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Six German light cruisers—, , , , , and —responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. However, the arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless telegraphy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> During the ensuing Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight,</b> München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of Heligoland.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in November 1917, Derfflinger sailed from port {{to assist}} the German light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, {{but by the time}} she and the other battlecruisers arrived on the scene, the British raiders had fled northward.|$|E
5|$|The sister ships {{spent the}} rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea; they {{provided}} distant cover during Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in 1917. In 1920 they were put into reserve and were then sold for scrap a few years later in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} four sister ships, , , , and , Kaiserin participated {{in all of}} the major fleet {{operations}} of World War I, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 Mayand 1 June 1916. The ship was also involved in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, in October 1917. She later saw action during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in November 1917.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, KzS von Karpf left Moltke; KzS Gygas assumed {{command of}} the ship. Between September and October 1917, the ship took part in Operation Albion {{supporting}} the German invasion of the Russian islands of Ösel, Dagö, and Moon (in present-day Estonia). Following the successful operation in the Baltic, Moltke was detached to support the II Reconnaissance Group (II AG), but did not actively participate in the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal was {{moderately}} damaged {{during the}} Battle of Jutland and required {{a month and}} a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. Princess Royal was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for breaking up as scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of war saw {{conflict}} in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by battlecruisers at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and Battle of Dogger Bank, and raids on the English coast. In May 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets on 31 May to 1 June in the indecisive Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was {{tasked with}} patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea {{in support of}} a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.|$|E
5|$|Fearless and the 1st DF {{saw nothing}} {{during that same}} patrol. She damaged two German light cruisers during the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> later in August. The {{squadron}} provided close cover for the seaplane carriers of the Harwich Force during the Cuxhaven Raid in late December, but the cruiser was only engaged by several Zeppelins and aircraft without effect. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Grand Fleet in early 1915 and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland the following year.|$|E
5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the ocean floor.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glorious was {{the second}} of the three s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord, Lord Fisher, they were {{relatively}} lightly armed and armoured. Glorious was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December 1939, The Times of London {{published}} {{the story of the}} Battle of the River Plate and the demise of , and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship. In accordance with Operational Order B. 60, dated 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea. The RAF bombers were ordered to overfly the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and the port of Wilhelmshaven, attacking ships but avoiding civilian living quarters, merchant shipping or land itself.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{served in}} the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> {{a month after the}} war began and then was sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands by the two Invincible-class battlecruisers, Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, {{although}} one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock. She was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required {{a month and a half}} of repairs. Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although they did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in 1917. In 1920 they were both put into reserve and were sold for scrap a few years later under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, a brief engagement between German light cruisers and a raiding force of British cruisers and battlecruisers took place on 28 August 1914. During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Six German light cruisers—, , , , , and —responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. The arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for only a few years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} invasion, the RAF {{intensified}} {{its operations}} against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1939, Vickers Wellington bombers {{carried out}} a raid on German {{shipping}} in {{what became known as}} the Air Battle of the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Detected on radar and engaged en route to their targets, over half the attacking force was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Ludlow-Hewitt presented a report on the attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners. He again pressed for a new bombsight that featured stabilization to allow the aircraft to manoeuvre while it approached the target.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, the British Harwich Force, {{supported}} by the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, broke into the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and attacked the II Scouting Group patrols. In the confused action, Mainz and Cöln were sunk, by light cruisers and battlecruisers, respectively. The majority of crewmen from Mainz were {{picked up by the}} British ships, but Cöln was lost with only one survivor. Kolberg was stationed in port during the attack, and steamed out to support the beleaguered German forces, but the British had departed by the time she reached the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was {{tasked with}} patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea {{in support of}} a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action. Hogue did, however, tow the heavily damaged light cruiser , flagship of the commander of the Harwich Force, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, back to port after the battle was over.|$|E
5|$|Danzig {{spent the}} first ten years of her career in the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. The ship saw extensive service during the First World War; she {{was present at the}} Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in August 1914, but did not engage British warships. She also saw action in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces, and was badly damaged by a Russian mine in November 1915. Danzig was also involved in Operation Albion, the seizure of the islands at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga, in September 1917. She was thereafter withdrawn from service, and surrendered to Britain {{after the end of the}} war as a war prize. Danzig was dismantled for scrap starting in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Fearless {{went out}} on the same patrol, but {{encountered}} nothing. She participated in the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and the Cuxhaven Raid later that year. The ship and her destroyers were transferred to the Grand Fleet in early 1915. , on the other hand, remained with the Grand Fleet and both ships played minor roles in the Battle of Jutland the following year. After the battle, Fearless was converted into a submarine depot ship and rejoined the Grand Fleet in 1917 as the leader of a submarine flotilla. A year later, she accidentally rammed and sank one submarine as part of an incident that sardonically {{came to be known as}} the Battle of May Island.|$|E
5|$|Gollob {{volunteered for}} {{military}} service in the Austrian Austrian Armed Forces in 1933. In March 1938, following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, Gollob {{was transferred to the}} Luftwaffe. In 1939, Gollob was posted to Zerstörergeschwader 76 (ZG76—76th Destroyer Wing), a heavy fighter wing. He claimed his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 during the invasion of Poland. Gollob claimed one victory during the Battle of the <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and two victories during the Norwegian Campaign. He then transferred to Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3—3rd Fighter Wing), flying the single-engined Messerschmitt Bf 109. In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain on the Channel Front, he claimed his sixth and final victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|HMS Tiger was {{the most}} heavily {{armoured}} battlecruiser of the Royal Navy {{at the start of}} the First World War, although she was still being finished when the war began. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915 even though she was still shaking down and did not perform well. She next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 where she was one of the British battlecruisers most often hit by German shells; she was only lightly damaged. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Major Francis John William Harvey, VC (29 April 1873 – 31 May 1916) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Marine Light Infantry during the First World War. Harvey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest {{military}} award for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at the height of the Battle of Jutland. A long serving Royal Marine officer descended of a military family, during his career Harvey became a specialist in naval artillery, serving on many large warships as gunnery training officer and gun commander. Specially requested for , the flagship of the British battlecruiser fleet, Harvey fought at the battles of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight,</b> Dogger Bank and Jutland.|$|E
5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were {{originally}} intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E
5|$|Stettin and Stuttgart both saw {{action with}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea. Stettin {{participated in the}} Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> in August 1914, and {{suffered}} relatively minor damage. Both cruisers participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Stettin was hit twice but was not badly damaged during the night, while Stuttgart emerged from the battle unscathed. Both ships were withdrawn from service in 1917; Stettin {{was used as a}} training ship, while Stuttgart was converted into a seaplane tender in 1918. The two ships survived the war and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes; they were later broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Stralsund was {{assigned}} to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career. She saw significant action {{in the early years of}} World War I, including several operations off the British coast and the Battles of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> and Dogger Bank, in August 1914 and November 1915, respectively. She was not damaged in either action. The ship was in dockyard hands during the Battle of Jutland, and so she missed the engagement. After the end of the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being surrendered to the Allies. She was ceded to the French Navy, where she served as Mulhouse until 1925. She was formally stricken in 1933 and broken up for scrap two years later.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, {{she served}} with the II Scouting Group, part of the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She was assigned to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914. At the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Mainz was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered a much stronger force of British cruisers and destroyers. They scored several damaging hits with gunfire and a torpedo that disabled Mainz and prompted her commander to abandon ship. The British rescued 348 men from the crew before the ship rolled over and sank. Eighty-nine men were killed in the battle, including her commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight</b> {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke her up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, Augsburg was deployed to the Baltic, while Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln remained in the North Sea. The three ships were assigned to patrol duty in the Heligoland Bight; on 28 August 1914, they were attacked during the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> <b>Bight.</b> Mainz and Cöln were both sunk in the battle. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, and joined Augsburg for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. Both ships also saw service during Operation Albion in October 1917. Both ships survived the war; Kolberg was ceded to France, where she was renamed Colmar and served in the French Navy until 1927. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan and was then sold for scrap.|$|E
