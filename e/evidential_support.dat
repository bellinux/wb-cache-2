40|$|Abstract — Intelligence analysts rely {{on reports}} that {{are subject to}} many {{varieties}} of uncertainty, such as noise in sensors; deception or error by human sources; or cultural misunderstanding.

In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{performance}} of three algorithms for soft evidential update, in which a probability distribution represented by a Bayesian network is modified to a new distribution constrained by given marginals, and closest to the original distribution according to cross entropy.

Null hypothesis testing is insufficient when size of effect is important, but it is ideal for testing ordinal claims relating the order of conditions, which are common in psychology. Null hypothesis testing also is insufficient for determining beliefs, but it is ideal for demonstrating sufficient <b>evidential</b> strength to <b>support</b> an ordinal claim, with sufficient evidence being 1 criterion for a finding entering the corpus of legitimate findings in psychology. The line between sufficient and in-sufficient evidence is currently set at p <. 05; there is little reason for allowing experimenters to select their own value of alpha.

In light of such line of reasoning, I move to Alston's Theory of Doxastic Practices (TDP) in the second section. After giving a skeletal account of TDP, I construe an argument in Alstonian terms against the naturalist refutations of EM. In the third section, I highlight the main problem with TDP, that is, the claim that perceptions and religious experiences have an analogical relation. Examples from sacred texts of different traditions show that such a claim fails to grasp what a religious experience is.

50|$|Many {{contemporary}} epistemologists {{reject the}} view that <b>evidential</b> <b>support</b> is the whole story about the justification of beliefs. While no sensible epistemologists generally urge people to disregard their evidence when forming beliefs, many believe that a more complete theory would introduce considerations about the processes that initiate and sustain beliefs. An example of one such theory is reliabilism. The most influential proponent of reliabilism is Alvin Goldman. According to a crude form of reliabilism, S is justified in believing p {{if and only if}} Ss belief in p is caused by a reliable process—a process that generally leads to true beliefs. Some of these reliable processes may require the processing of evidence; many others won't. So, Goldman would argue, evidentialism, on which the justification of a belief always turns completely {{on the issue of the}} belief's <b>evidential</b> <b>support,</b> is false. Likewise, evidentialism will be rejected by more sophisticated versions of reliabilism, some of which will allow evidence an important but limited role, as opposed to the all-encompassing role assigned to it by evidentialism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{general purpose}} of this paper is to {{demonstrate}} through a well defined example how philosophy of science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other by sharing some of their ideas, methods and techniques developed to tackle similar problems. The problem on which we will focus is the analysis of non-deductive inferences, which is performed in AI by the study of nonmonotonic commonsensical reasoning, and in philosophy of science by the so-called theory of inductive or evidential confirmation. After analyzing to what extent one of the most wide spread nonmonotonic formalisms – default logic – can be taken as a logic of confirmation in the philosophical sense, and carefully considering the similarities and dissimilarities of the problems faced in these contexts, an expanded version of default logic, called by us a logic of inductive implication, is introduced. It is then shown how this new framework can be used to represent different types of inductive calculi that may be of relevance to both AI and philosophy of science research. In particular, it is shown how our logic can formalize some traditional ideas concerning confirmation theory, in particular the ones proposed by Carl Hempel in his classical paper “Studies in the Logic of confirmation ” of 1945 and the ones incorporated by the so-called abductive and hypotheticodeductive models. From a more theoretical point of view, we believe that these formalizations represent a relevant step in the understanding of the logic of <b>evidential</b> or confirmatory <b>support...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is an {{extensive}} and growing {{literature on the}} design and use of stated choice experiments. Such experiments are generally regarded as the preferred framework within which to collect data to reveal the preferences of individuals in a particular application context. Analysts have developed sophisticated ways of analysing such data, typically using a form of discrete choice model that identifies the marginal (dis) utility associated with each observed attribute linked to an alternative, as well as accounting for sources of preference and scale heterogeneity. There is also a growing literature studying the attribute processing rules (or heuristics) that respondents use {{as a way of}} simplifying the task of choosing, for all manner of meaningful reason. We find that there is relatively less effort placed on looking closely at the data defining each choice situation for each respondent, as constructed by the stated choice experiment, and seeing if there exist <b>evidential.</b> rules that <b>support</b> in a plausible way, the choice responses. Heuristics investigated in this paper that might aid in our understanding of how choice scenarios are processed, leading to a choice outcome, include the role of dimensional vs. holistic attribute processing, the influence of relative attribute levels, and the revision of the reference alternative as value learning across sequenced choice sets. We find a high level of confidence in the evidence, and identify at least two features of choice set processing, namely value learning and majority of confirming dimensions, that are worthy of future inclusion in the estimation of all choice models. The evidence suggests that {{there is a great deal}} of behavioural sense in stated choice responses, for all manner of possible reason...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Empathy is {{frequently}} cited {{as an important}} attribute in physicians and some groups have {{expressed a desire to}} measure empathy either at selection for medical school or during medical (or postgraduate) training. In order to do this, a reliable and valid test of empathy is required. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine {{the reliability and validity of}} existing tests for the assessment of medical empathy. Methods A systematic review of research papers relating to the reliability and validity of tests of empathy in medical students and doctors. Journal databases (Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched for English-language articles relating to the assessment of empathy and related constructs in applicants to medical school, medical students, and doctors. Results From 1147 citations, we identified 50 relevant papers describing 36 different instruments of empathy measurement. As some papers assessed more than one instrument, there were 59 instrument assessments. 20 of these involved only medical students, 30 involved only practising clinicians, and three involved only medical school applicants. Four assessments involved both medical students and practising clinicians, and two studies involved both medical school applicants and students. Eight instruments demonstrated evidence of reliability, internal consistency, and validity. Of these, six were self-rated measures, one was a patient-rated measure, and one was an observer-rated measure. Conclusion A number of empathy measures available have been psychometrically assessed for research use among medical students and practising medical doctors. No empathy measures were found with sufficient evidence of predictive validity for use as selection measures for medical school. However, measures with a sufficient <b>evidential</b> base to <b>support</b> their use as tools for investigating the role of empathy in medical training and clinical care are available. </p...|$|R

40|$|Inductive {{reasoning}} is of remarkable interest as it plays {{a crucial role}} in many human activities, including hypotheses evaluation in scientific inquiry, learning processes, prediction of future events, and diagnosis of a phenomenon (e. g., medical diagnosis). Despite the relevance of these cognitive processes in a variety of settings, there still remains much to understand about the basis of human inductive inferences. For example, it is not yet clear whether the same psychological mechanisms underlie both inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning or, on the contrary, whether induction and deduction correspond to distinct mental processes. The study of inductive reasoning has been a traditional topic in epistemology, and is more recently being explored in cognitive psychology as well. In the present contribution, I focus on both the epistemological and the psychological accounts. To begin with, I illustrate the state-of-art of research on inductive reasoning. On one hand, epistemologists have been working to develop normative theories in which the notion of inductive strength (or confirmation) is formalized. I discuss some of the alternative Bayesian measures of confirmation proposed in the literature on inductive logic. On the other hand, psychologists have been empirically investigating inductive reasoning, discovering important phenomena such as systematic effects of similarity, typicality, and diversity. I illustrate some of the most significant models of induction proposed in the psychological literature to account for such phenomena. Both lines of inquiry – epistemological and psychological – have focused on a restricted kind of induction problem: when assessing the inductive strength of arguments, premises are assumed to be true, that is, ascertained with the maximum degree of probability. However, inductive arguments occurring in real settings often depart from this pattern. Indeed, in a variety of situations, one may need {{to assess the impact of}} a piece of evidence whose probability may have significantly changed while not attaining certainty. Evidential uncertainty in inductive inferences is at the core of the present research. After exploring a selection of psychological phenomena concerning uncertainty, I address the epistemological problem of how to extend Bayesian confirmation theory to include cases where the evidence is not certain. A straightforward solution is proposed for a major class of confirmation measures called P-incremental. The solution proposed is based on Jeffrey conditionalization, an essential formal principle discussed below in greater detail. On the psychological account, I discuss two experimental studies conducted to test whether and how people’s judgments of inductive strength depend on the degree of evidential uncertainty. In the first study the uncertainty of evidence is explicitly manipulated by means of numerical values, whereas in the second study uncertainty is implicitly manipulated by means of ambiguous pictures. The results show that people’s judgments are highly correlated with those predicted by two normatively sound Bayesian measures of confirmation. This sensitivity to the degree of <b>evidential</b> uncertainty <b>supports</b> the centrality of inductive reasoning in cognition, and opens the path to further investigations on induction in real contexts...|$|R
40|$|Exercise during growth may {{increase}} peak bone mass; if {{the benefits are}} maintained it may {{reduce the risk of}} fracture later in life (1). It is hypothesised that exercise will preferentially enhance bone formation on the surface of cortical bone that is undergoing bone modeling at the time (2). Therefore, exercise {{may increase}} bone mass accrual on the outer periosteal surface during the pre- and peri-pubertal years, and on the inner endocortical surface during puberty (3). An increase in bone formation on the periosteal surface is, however, more effective for increasing bone strength than medullary contraction (4). While exercise may have a role in osteoporosis prevention, there is little <b>evidential</b> basis to <b>support</b> this notion. It is generally accepted that weight-bearing exercise is important, but it is not known how much, how often, what magnitude or how long children need to exercise before a clinically important increase in bone density is obtained. In this thesis, the effect of exercise on the growing skeleton is investigated in two projects. The first quantifies the magnitude and number of loads associated with and in a moderate and low impact exercise program and non-structured play. The second project examines how exercise affects bone size and shape during different stages of growth. Study One: The Assessment of the Magnitude of Exercise Loading and the Skeletal Response in Girls Questions: 1) Does moderate impact exercise lead to a greater increase in BMC than low impact exercise? 2) Does loading history influence the osteogenic response to moderate impact exercise? 3) What is the magnitude and number of loads that are associated with a moderate and low impact exercise program? Methods: Sixty-eight pre-and early-pubertal girls (aged 8. 9 ± 0. 2 years) were randomised to either a moderate or low impact exercise regime for 8. 5 -months.
