5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to be {{built into}} the language's core, Python {{was designed to be}} highly <b>extensible.</b> Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily <b>extensible</b> interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|The {{oral cavity}} of the fin whale {{has a very}} {{stretchy}} or <b>extensible</b> nerve system which aids them in feeding.|$|E
5|$|BootX was {{superseded}} by another nearly identical bootloader named boot.efi and an <b>Extensible</b> Firmware Interface ROM on {{the release of}} the Intel-based Mac.|$|E
5|$|Future {{plans for}} Perl 5 include making the core {{language}} easier to extend from modules, {{and providing a}} small, <b>extensible</b> meta-object protocol in core.|$|E
5|$|Up until version 3.6, Web was <b>extensible</b> with a plugin {{system called}} Web extensions. This package was {{distributed}} by the developers of Web and contained the official extensions. For version 3.8, this system was removed because of problems with stability and maintainability, with some popular extensions, such as ad blocking, being moved to the core application instead.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, <b>extensible</b> proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long <b>extensible</b> snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, <b>Extensible</b> Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is {{made possible by the}} presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, <b>extensible</b> tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E
25|$|In PDF 1.4, {{support was}} added for Metadata Streams, using the <b>Extensible</b> Metadata Platform (XMP) to add XML standards-based <b>extensible</b> {{metadata}} {{as used in}} other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, {{as well as the}} whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an <b>extensible</b> schema.|$|E

25|$|Vulcanization {{of rubber}} creates {{disulfide}} bonds between chains, which limits the {{degrees of freedom}} and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less <b>extensible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apple uses {{a subset}} of the {{standard}} PC architecture, which provides support for Mac OS X and support for other operating systems. Hardware and firmware components that must be supported to run an operating system on Apple-Intel hardware include the <b>Extensible</b> Firmware Interface.|$|E
25|$|It is as {{important}} to decide what a system is not as to decide what it is. Do not serve all the world's needs; rather, make the system <b>extensible</b> so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.|$|E
25|$|While {{the idea}} of markup {{language}} originated with text documents, there is increasing use of markup languages in the presentation {{of other types of}} information, including playlists, vector graphics, web services, content syndication, and user interfaces. Most of these are XML applications, because XML is a well-defined and <b>extensible</b> language.|$|E
25|$|Windows Mobility Center {{is a new}} Control Panel applet {{available}} on mobile computers that centralizes information and settings relevant to mobile features, including display brightness, power options, presentation settings, and sync settings. It is <b>extensible</b> so that hardware manufacturers can add further capabilities to control other features specific to their hardware.|$|E
25|$|Since January 2000, all W3C Recommendations for HTML {{have been}} based on XML rather than SGML, using the {{abbreviation}} XHTML (<b>Extensible</b> HyperText Markup Language). The language specification requires that XHTML Web documents must be well-formed XML documents. This allows for more rigorous and robust documents while using tags familiar from HTML.|$|E
25|$|GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a {{standard}} for {{the layout of the}} partition table on a physical hard disk.

25|$|With {{the change}} in architecture, a change in {{firmware}} became necessary. <b>Extensible</b> Firmware Interface (EFI) is the firmware-based replacement for the PC BIOS from Intel. Designed by Intel, it was chosen by Apple to replace Open Firmware, used on PowerPC architectures. Since many operating systems, such as Windows XP and many versions of Windows Vista, are incompatible with EFI, Apple has released a firmware upgrade with a compatibility support module that provides a subset of traditional BIOS support with their Boot Camp product.|$|E
25|$|The MPEG-4 Part 20 {{standard}} - Lightweight Application Scene Representation (LASeR) and Simple Aggregation Format (SAF) {{is based}} on SVG Tiny. It was developed by MPEG (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11) and published as ISO/IEC 14496-20:2006. SVG capabilities are enhanced in MPEG-4 Part 20 with key features for mobile services, such as dynamic updates, binary encoding, state-of-art font representation. SVG was also accommodated in MPEG-4 Part 11, in the <b>Extensible</b> MPEG-4 Textual (XMT) format - a textual representation of the MPEG-4 multimedia content using XML.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} offers a taxonomy for non-financial business reporting, which {{is becoming increasingly}} important in SEC Filings. In some approaches taxonomies are supported by <b>Extensible</b> Business Reporting Language XBRL. Venture capitalists and investors {{are concerned with the}} capability of a firm to create value in future. Financial statements are limited to current and past financial indicators and valuations of capital assets. In contrast, value {{network analysis}} is one approach to assessing current and future capability for value creation and to describe and analyze a business model.|$|E
