5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the study}} of heat {{conduction}} is based on several principles. Heat flow {{is a form of}} <b>energy</b> <b>flow,</b> and as such it is meaningful to speak of the time rate of flow of heat into a region of space.|$|E

25|$|Benthic, or bottom-dwelling, fishes include white {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser transmontanus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus).

25|$|Cells are {{the basic}} unit of {{structure}} in every living thing, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow and others during the early nineteenth century, and subsequently became widely accepted. The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of its cells, with <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> occurring within and between them. Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{formalism}} that improves {{the applicability of}} perturbative QCD in the current region of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The formalism is based on all-order resummation of large logarithms arising in the perturbative treatment of hadron multiplicities and <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> in this region. It is shown that the current region of semi-inclusive DIS {{is similar to the}} region of small transverse momenta in vector boson production at hadron colliders. We use this resummation formalism to describe transverse <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> and charged particle multiplicity measured at the electron-proton collider HERA. We find good agreement between our theoretical results and experimental data for the transverse <b>energy</b> <b>flows.</b> 1 I...|$|R
50|$|For example, the Poynting vector {{within the}} {{dielectric}} insulator of a coaxial cable is nearly {{parallel to the}} wire axis (assuming no fields outside the cable and a wavelength longer than {{the diameter of the}} cable, including DC). Electrical energy delivered to the load is flowing entirely through the dielectric between the conductors. Very little <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> in the conductors themselves, since the electric field strength is nearly zero. The <b>energy</b> <b>flowing</b> in the conductors flows radially into the conductors and accounts for energy lost to resistive heating of the conductor. No <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> outside the cable, either, since there the magnetic fields of inner and outer conductors cancel to zero.|$|R
40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>flows</b> in deep inelastic electron-proton {{scattering}} are investigated at a center-of-mass {{energy of}} 296 GeV for the range Q 2 greater-than-or-equal-to 10 GeV 2 using the ZEUS detector. A comparison is made between events {{with and without}} a large rapidity gap between the hadronic system and the proton direction. The <b>energy</b> <b>flows,</b> corrected for detector acceptance and resolution, are shown for these two classes of events in both the HERA laboratory frame and the Breit frame. From {{the differences in the}} shapes of these <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> we conclude that QCD radiation is suppressed in the large-rapidity-gap events compared to the events without a large rapidity gap...|$|R
25|$|In {{their report}} on the status and {{potential}} impacts of alien invasive organisms in the fynbos biome, MacDonald & Jarman (1984) predicted that Theba pisana would have very little impact on ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> and sediment dynamics or on the germination and succession processes of the plant community itself. However, the snail could seriously impact directly on fynbos plants, by feeding on them, and also displace native herbivores by competing with them for resources, and these effects have not been studied.|$|E
25|$|While the {{recycled}} nutrients may support some phytoplankton growth, {{it ultimately}} feeds back to increased C. amurensis populations. The recent invasion success of Limnoithona tetraspina may {{be understood in}} terms of this phenomenon. It feeds on ciliates and microflagellates which are too small to be grazed by the clam, thereby avoiding competition. Additionally, L. tetraspina appears impervious to predation by the clam or (almost) anything else. The rise of the microbial food web and the invasion of L. tetraspina capitalize are the result of an untapped alternative path for <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> in the food web, facilitated by C. amurensis. Subsequent patterns of invasion may reflect a similar pattern.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} scheme, the first trophic level (level 1) is plants, then herbivores (level 2), and then carnivores (level 3). The trophic level {{is equal to}} one more than the chain length, which {{is the number of}} links connecting to the base. The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero. Ecologists identify feeding relations and organize species into trophic species through extensive gut content analysis of different species. The technique has been improved through the use of stable isotopes to better trace <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> through the web. It was once thought that omnivory was rare, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. This realization has made trophic classifications more complex.|$|E

5000|$|Ecological {{energetics}} is {{the quantitative}} {{study of the}} <b>flow</b> of <b>energy</b> through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the principles which describe the propensity of such <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem <b>energy</b> <b>flows</b> or [...] "ecosystem laws" [...] (i.e. principles of ecological energetics) are considered formally analogous {{to the principles of}} energetics.|$|R
25|$|Work can be {{extracted}} also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When {{the flow of}} energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment {{of the notion of}} energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy {{is a measure of the}} ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the second principle of <b>energy</b> <b>flow</b> transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.|$|E
25|$|If {{ecosystems}} are governed primarily by stochastic processes, through which its subsequent {{state would be}} determined by both predictable and random actions, {{they may be more}} resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a balance of nature, the species composition of ecosystems would undergo shifts that would depend {{on the nature of the}} change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events. In 1997, Robert Ulanowicz used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced <b>energy</b> <b>flow,</b> and eutrophication.|$|E
