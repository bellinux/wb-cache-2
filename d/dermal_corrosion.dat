50|$|Another {{approach}} has been the development of test methods that use cultured human cells. Human epidermal keratinocytes have been cultured to mimic the human epidermis, and are used to measure skin irritation and <b>dermal</b> <b>corrosion.</b> This method has been accepted by the EU and is intended to replace the Draize rabbit skin irritation test.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that skin assays based on {{reconstructed human epidermis}} (RhE) models {{can be used in}} place of in vivo testing to accurately predict corrosivity and/or irritancy of commodity chemicals. Due to REACH legislation, substances from various categories of fatty amines derivatives have been evaluated for <b>dermal</b> <b>corrosion</b> applying either the EpiDerm™ (EPI- 200) or EpiSkin™ assay. Available data and practical experience indicated that these substances are corrosive to the skin. The substances tested are cationic surfactants which dermal effects are characterized by a delayed severe inflammatory reaction. The mechanism is thought to be related to disruption of the cellular membrane following diffusion of the long apolar tails of the molecules into the lipid bilayers. However, unexpectedly almost all obtained study results indicated that these substances are NOT corrosive in these in vitro RhE test systems. Since these results did not align with the experiences on such substances, limited in vivo rabbit studies were employed additionally. These studies confirmed that after some delay full skin tissue destruction occurs, requiring classification as Corrosive Cat. 1 B or 1 C for GHS. The results obtained for various fatty amine derivatives shows that RhE assays do not always predict corrosivity correctly...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{irritation}} is {{a common}} occupational hazard for employ-ees engaged in the manufacture, transport, and use of industrial chemicals. The most common method used to evaluate <b>dermal</b> irri-tation and/or <b>corrosion</b> has typically been in vivo tests using rabbits (Draize method). Several in vitro test methods have been devel-oped, with Corrositex being the first to gain approval by a regu-latory agency (U. S. Department of Transportation). The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the results of in vitro (Corrositex) assays of dermal irritation/corrosion to in vivo test data for sev-eral industrial chemical formulations and to determine the pre-dictability and usefulness of the Corrositex assay for these types of products. Twenty-four (24) formulations were qualified, catego-rized, and evaluated using the Corrositex method and the results compared to available animal data for each of the formulations. The Corrositex assay accurately predicted a corrosive end poin...|$|R
