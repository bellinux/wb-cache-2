The <b>great</b> <b>black</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> for example, {{the largest of the}} tribe, lives almost entirely off the central shoot or 'cabbage' of palm-trees: an {{expensive}} kind of food, for when once the 'cabbage' is eaten the tree dies forthwith, so that each black cockatoo must have killed in his time whole groves of cabbage-palms. Others, again, feed off fruits and seeds; and not a few are entirely adapted for flower-haunting and honey-sucking.|$|E
60|$|New and {{interesting}} birds were continually brought in, either {{by my own}} boys or by the natives, {{and at the end}} of a week Ali arrived triumphant one afternoon with a fine specimen of the Great Bird of Paradise. The ornamental plumes had not yet attained their full growth, but the richness of their glossy orange colouring, and the exquisite delicacy of the loosely waving feathers, were unsurpassable. At the same time a <b>great</b> <b>black</b> <b>cockatoo</b> was brought in, as well as a fine fruit-pigeon and several small birds, so that we were all kept hard at work skinning till sunset. Just as we had cleared away and packed up for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the natives. It resembled in size, and in its white woolly covering, a small fat lamb, but had short legs, hand-like feet with large claws, and a long prehensile tail. It was a Cuscus (C. maculatus), one of the curious marsupial animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin. The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was grout hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set to work immediately and get out the body for them, to which they agreed. The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off; but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and after an hour's hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper.|$|E
60|$|We now had {{to search}} for the narrow channel among islands, which we knew was somewhere hereabouts, and which leads to the villages {{on the south side of}} Waigiou. Entering a deep bay which looked promising, we got to the end of it, but it was then dusk, so we {{anchored}} for the night, and having just finished all our water could cook no rice for supper. Next morning early (29th) we went on shore among the mangroves, and a little way inland found some water, which relieved our anxiety considerably, and left us free to go along the coast in search of the opening, or of some one who could direct us to it. During the three days we had now been among the reefs and islands, we had only seen a single small canoe, which had approached pretty near to us, and then, notwithstanding our signals, went off in another direction. The shores seemed all desert; not a house, or boat, or human being, or a puff of smoke was to be seen; and as we could only go on the course that the ever-changing wind would allow us (our hands being too few to row any distance), our prospects of getting to our destination seemed rather remote and precarious. Having gone to the eastward extremity of the deep bay we had entered, without finding any sign of an opening, we turned westward; and towards evening were so fortunate as to find a small village of seven miserable houses built on piles in the water. Luckily the Orang-kaya, or head man, could speak a little. Malay, and informed us that the entrance to the strait was really in the bay we had examined, but that it was not to be seen except when close inshore. He said the strait was often very narrow, and wound among lakes and rocks and islands, and that it would take two days to reach the large village of Muka, and three more to get to Waigiou. I succeeded in hiring two men to go with us to Muka, bringing a small boat in which to return; but we had to wait a day for our guides, so I took my gun and made a little excursion info the forest. The day was wet and drizzly, and I only succeeded in shooting two small birds, but I saw the <b>great</b> <b>black</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> and had a glimpse of one or two Birds of Paradise, whose loud screams we had heard on first approaching the coast. Leaving the village the next morning (July 1st) with a light wind, it took us all day to reach the entrance to the channel, which resembled a small river, and was concealed by a projecting point, so that it was no wonder we did not discover it amid the dense forest vegetation which everywhere covers these islands to the water's edge. A little way inside it becomes bounded by precipitous rocks, after winding among which for about two miles, we emerged into what seemed a lake, but which was in fact a deep gulf having a narrow entrance on the south coast. This gulf was studded along its shores with numbers of rocky islets, mostly mushroom shaped, from the `eater having worn away the lower part of the soluble coralline limestone, leaving them overhanging from ten to twenty feet. Every islet was covered will strange-looping shrubs and trees, and was generally crowned by lofty and elegant palms, which also studded the ridges of the mountainous shores, forming one of the most singular and picturesque landscapes I have ever seen. The current which had brought us through the narrow strait now ceased, and we were obliged to row, which with our short and heavy prau was slow work. I went on shore several times, but the rocks were so precipitous, sharp, and honeycombed, that I found it impossible to get through the tangled thicket with which they were everywhere clothed. It took us three days to get to the entrance of the gulf, and then the wind was such as to prevent our going any further, and we might have had to wait for days or weeps, when, much to my surprise and gratification, a boat arrived from Muka with one of the head men, who had in some mysterious manner heard I was on my way, and had come to my assistance, bringing a present of cocoa-nuts and vegetables. Being thoroughly acquainted with the coast, and having several extra men to assist us, he managed to get the prau along by rowing, poling, or sailing, and by night had brought us safely into harbour, a great relief after our tedious and unhappy voyage. We had been already eight days among the reefs and islands of Waigiou, coming a distance of about fifty miles, and it was just forty days since we had sailed from Goram.|$|E

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (Calyptorhynchus spp.) in the ‘biodiversity hotspot’ of {{south-west}} Western Australia are in decline, due {{to multiple}} threatening processes that include habitat loss, poaching, competition with other species, vehicle strikes and shootings. The combined {{efforts of the}} Perth Zoo Veterinary Department (PZVD) and the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) {{have led to a}} specialised rehabilitation program centred upon the return of injured and debilitated <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> to the wild. This PhD project focused on improving the efficacy of this program and expanding the current knowledge of the health status and biology of <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> The medical records of 565 <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> that were admitted to the PZVD from 2000 to 2009 were analysed to determine the effect of the birds’ clinical presentation on survival. Anaemia, superficial and deep soft tissue injuries, fractures, paralysis or paresis and abnormal faecal cytology were identified as significant factors when determining the likelihood of survival of cockatoos undergoing the rehabilitation process. In addition, data on the life histories and origin of admitted cockatoos, post-mortem examination results and post-release information is presented. Haematologic and serum biochemical reference values are also presented for the three species of <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> that are regularly admitted to the PZVD. The significance of Chlamydia psittaci infection to the <b>black</b> <b>cockatoo</b> rehabilitation program was investigated. No wild birds admitted to the PZVD were found to be positive for C. psittaci infection, which suggests that this infection either is not present in wild populations, or has a low prevalence. However, the study found that <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> undergoing rehabilitation are at risk of contracting the disease during their stay in captivity through contact with infected birds. These results highlight the importance of disease surveillance to the management of an avian rehabilitation program. The thesis includes the results of an aviary trial to investigate methods of attaching transmitters to <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> Mean retention times for the transmitter packages ranged from 44 to 384 days. These results support the potential feasibility of using transmitters on cockatoos post-release, with sufficient retention times to allow for the collection of valuable movement and survival data. Among the gaps in current knowledge of wild <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> perhaps the most concerning is that regarding the age structure of wild populations. The thesis encompasses a study that established an aging tool for <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos,</b> based on pentosidine analysis from the skin of 53 <b>black</b> <b>cockatoos</b> of known age.
