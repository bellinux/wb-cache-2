5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E

His commanding officers supported him in this athletic vision and gave him additional time off to practice for the Olympics.

Apparently he courted a local Lansingburgh girl sometime during the summer, but nothing else is known.|$|E
25|$|Attila Nyíri of Hungary {{proposed}} a solution after studying two {{pages of the}} codex. He simply turned the pages upside down, identified a Sumerian ligature, then he associated Latin letters {{to the rest of}} the symbols by resemblance. However, he sometimes transliterated the same symbol with different letters, and vice versa, the same letter was decoded from several symbols. Then <b>he</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> to rearrange the order of the letters to produce meaningful words. The text, if taken as meaningful, is of religious, perhaps liturgical character.|$|E
25|$|Rashid al-Din also {{collected}} {{all of his}} compositions into {{a single}} volume, entitled Jami' al-Tasanif al-Rashidi ("The Collected Works of Rashid"), complete with maps and illustrations. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> some of his shorter works, on medicine and government, translated into Chinese.

25|$|When {{his older}} brother Unruoch III died in 874, Berengar succeeded him in the March of Friuli. With this he {{obtained}} a key position in the Carolingian Empire, as the march bordered the Croats and other Slavs who were a constant threat to the Italian peninsula. He was a territorial magnate with lordship over several counties in northeastern Italy. He was an important channel for the men of Friuli {{to get access to}} the emperor and for the emperor to exercise authority in Friuli. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a large degree of influence on the church of Friuli. In 884–885, Berengar intervened with the emperor on behalf of Haimo, Bishop of Belluno.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{how much}} energy he put into this venture, which {{he hoped would}} bring him some {{commercial}} success, Kees found time to produce a fine series of collages. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> two more one-man shows in New York City as well as shows in San Francisco, including an impressive installation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. He had also exchanged his film camera for a still camera, and began taking the photographs that would illustrate the book Nonverbal Communication (Berkeley:, University of California Press, 1956), which he wrote with Jurgen Ruesch, psychiatrist and semiotician. Many of these photographs would qualify as art photography as well as scientific data.|$|E
500|$|... "Scary Monsters" [...] {{was written}} by Thomas Schnauz, who had {{previously}} penned the ninth season episode [...] "Lord of the Flies". The entry was directed by Dwight H. Little, his first and only directing credit for the series. Schnauz later admitted that his inspiration for the episode was [...] "basically panic". He explained that the writing staff {{needed to get the}} script done as quickly as possibly, but Schnauz only had the teaser conceived. When he went to pitch it, <b>he</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "whole other story that wasn't working." [...] Fellow writer Vince Gilligan suggested that Shnauz make the child the root of the all of the episode's problems. However, the writing staff did not want the story to develop into a [...] "kid-in-the-cornfield" [...] territory, according to Gilligan—a reference to a 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone wherein a monster-child can control the world through his mental powers. Eventually, when the writers began to piece the script together, they realized that they needed a villain, and the only character that could play the part would be Tommy.|$|E

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] And I think he recognized that {{it was the best thing}} for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; <b>he</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E
500|$|During {{the middle}} Byzantine period (up {{to the late}} 11th century), its {{official}} place in the hierarchy was not high, but its proximity to the emperor did facilitate a rapid rise of its holders, as exemplified by the career of Manuel the Armenian or the future emperors Michael II and Basil I the Macedonian. In the Klētorologion of 899 he is recorded {{as one of the}} [...] "special dignities" [...] (axiai eidikai) and ranked 48th among the sixty most senior palace officials. Holders of the post could aspire to some of the highest court ranks, such as anthypatos patrikios or prōtospatharios. The imperial prōtostratōr had a prominent place in imperial ceremonies, riding beside the Byzantine emperor on processions (along with his superior, the Count of the Stable) or during the hunt. During campaigns, he and the Count of the Stable stood by near the imperial tent, along with three stratores with harnessed horses. In triumphal processions from the Great Palace to the Forum of Constantine he carried the emperor's banner (flammoulon), preceding the emperor from the hall of the consistorium until the forum, and placed the imperial spear on the neck of the captive Arab leaders. On certain occasions, <b>he</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> the task of introducing foreign envoys at imperial audiences.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Cowart is of English {{descent and}} {{was raised in}} Bells, Tennessee. He had a strong {{interest}} in computers and had no criminal record. Cowart attended Jackson Christian School until 2006, but did not graduate. [...] He was expelled from Jackson Christian after calling in a bomb threat. He applied for Jackson State Community College to study computers but, although his family believed he was indeed attending the school, he never provided documentation or pursued other steps to enroll there. Cowart moved to Texas in the spring of 2007 to live with friends he met on the Internet, but was unable to find work and returned to Bells to live with his grandparents a month later. Cowart worked at a Bells grocery store called the Bells Market Place for one year until May 2007 before moving to Texas for a brief time. Cowart worked and got along with several minority co-workers, who later expressed shock at his arrest. Mitchell Twitty, a black former co-worker, said of Cowart, [...] "He treated me like we were best friends. I never, ever heard him make a racist remark." [...] Twitty said Cowart tended to keep to himself and at times acted [...] "a little strange." [...] Other co-workers described him as hard-working and friendly, but said he did not have many friends. One family friend thought he was intelligent and full of potential: [...] "I always saw him as a doctor or lawyer, or even a senator. <b>He</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> the potential to become what Obama is, running for president." ...|$|E
