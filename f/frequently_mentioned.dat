5|$|Morrow was <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> as a {{potential}} candidate for vice president in 1920, but he withdrew his name from consideration, sticking to a campaign promise not to seek a higher office while governor. On July 27, 1920, he made a speech in Northampton, Massachusetts, officially notifying Calvin Coolidge of his nomination for that office. Although he supported Frank O. Lowden for president, the nomination went to Warren G. Harding, and Morrow campaigned vigorously {{on behalf of his}} party's ticket.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} the work is Jesus as the conqueror of the works of the devil, who is <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> as the serpent. The music is festively scored, using two horns, similar to Part IV of Bach's later Christmas Oratorio. The text by an unknown poet is {{organised}} in eight movements, beginning with a choral movement on the biblical text, followed by a sequence of recitatives and arias which is structured as three stanzas from three different hymns. Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> in Nazi propaganda, where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Greece, Orion had a hero cult in {{the region}} of Boeotia. The number of places {{associated}} with his birth suggest that it was widespread. Hyria, the most <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned,</b> was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire. They had a tomb of Orion most likely at the foot of Mount Cerycius (now Mount Tanagra). Maurice Bowra argues that Orion was a national hero of the Boeotians, much as Castor and Pollux were for the Dorians. He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the Battle of Coronea in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought on their side and defeated the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and turned in a frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, {{and still not}} fully resolved. Known to the ancients, the genus name appears in Graeco-Roman literature, although their interest was as much medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species the ancients were familiar with. Although <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a family (Narcissi) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern placement within Amaryllidaceae, although {{for a while it}} was considered part of Liliaceae.|$|E
5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most eminent gardeners of his day. He {{maintained}} close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen such as William Coys, John Gerard, John Tradescant the elder (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and the Frenchman Matthias de Lobel (also known as Matthias de L'Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, they belonged to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the Levant and from Virginia, broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel <b>frequently</b> <b>mentioned</b> the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson's abilities. Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in Theatrum Botanicum the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in Highgate supervising the gardens of Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche.|$|E
