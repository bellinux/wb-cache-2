25|$|Any {{letter sent}} within Canada has the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> on {{the centre of}} its envelope, with a stamp, postal indicia, meter label, or frank mark on the {{top-right}} corner of the envelope to acknowledge payment of postage. A return address, {{although it is not}} required, can be put on the top-left corner or the back of the envelope in smaller type than the <b>destination</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traffic is {{exchanged}} (routed) between subnetworks {{with special}} gateways (routers) when the routing prefixes {{of the source}} address and the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.|$|E
25|$|Similar to MapQuest, {{which offers}} driving directions, TripPlanner {{provides}} search fields for starting address and <b>destination</b> <b>address,</b> and allows end users {{to navigate the}} complexity of the subway and bus system by narrowing their options to subway, local bus or express bus only, minimizing the number of transfers or time, and adjusting the walking distance to and from the transit stop.|$|E
50|$|Both {{source and}} <b>destination</b> <b>{{addresses}}</b> {{are used in}} this algorithm: source addresses are recorded in entries in the table, while <b>destination</b> <b>addresses</b> are looked up in the table and matched to the proper segment to send the frame to.|$|R
5000|$|SSM <b>destination</b> <b>addresses</b> {{must be in}} {{the ranges}} [...] for IPv4.

2500|$|... 6to4 embeds an IPv6 packet in the payload {{portion of}} an IPv4 packet with {{protocol}} type 41. To send an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network to a 6to4 <b>destination</b> <b>address,</b> an IPv4 header with protocol type 41 is prepended to the IPv6 packet. [...] The IPv4 <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> for the prepended packet header {{is derived from}} the IPv6 <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> of the inner packet (which is in the format of a 6to4 address), by extracting the 32 bits immediately following the IPv6 destination address's 2002::/16 prefix. The IPv4 source address in the prepended packet header is the IPv4 address of the host or router which is sending the packet over IPv4. The resulting IPv4 packet is then routed to its IPv4 <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> just like any other IPv4 packet.|$|E
2500|$|... similarly, if the {{destination}} IPv6 address is a 6to4 IPv6 address, its corresponding 6to4 router IPv4 address matches the IPv4 <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> in the IPv4 encapsulation header, ...|$|E
2500|$|To allow {{hosts and}} {{networks}} using 6to4 addresses to exchange traffic with hosts using [...] "native" [...] IPv6 addresses, [...] "relay routers" [...] have been established. [...] A relay router connects to an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network. [...] 6to4 packets arriving on an IPv4 interface {{will have their}} IPv6 payloads routed to the IPv6 network, while packets arriving on the IPv6 interface with a <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> prefix of 2002::/16 will be encapsulated and forwarded over the IPv4 network.|$|E
40|$|In the {{traditional}} IP scheme, both the packet forwarding and the routing protocols are source invariant, i. e., their decisions {{depend on the}} <b>destination</b> IP <b>address</b> {{and not on the}} source address. Recent protocols, such as MPLS, as well as traditional circuit based protocols like PNNI allow routing decisions to depend on both the source and <b>destination</b> <b>addresses.</b> In fact, much of the theoretical work on routing assumes per-flow forwarding and routing, i. e., the forwarding decision is based on both the source and <b>destination</b> <b>addresses...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Ethernet frame used in LLDP has its <b>destination</b> MAC <b>address</b> {{typically}} set to {{a special}} multicast address that 802.1D-compliant bridges do not forward. Other multicast and unicast <b>destination</b> <b>addresses</b> are permitted. The EtherType field is set to 0x88cc.|$|R
2500|$|Special modems {{such as the}} 9522A, 9601, 9602 and Quake Q9612 can be {{used for}} sending and {{receiving}} short data bursts, less than 2kilobytes at a time. This service is often used for asset tracking and remote monitoring. Messages are converted to be delivered in email format or over HTTP to a preconfigured address; the mobile unit does not include a <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> when sending a SBD message. A crude positioning report is also included in each message sent. SBD messages take from 6 to 22 seconds to send or receive. [...] The latest generation of SBD transceiver, the Iridium 9602, can receive up to 270 bytes per SBD data message (defined by Iridium as [...] "mobile terminated SBD") and can transmit a maximum of 340 bytes per SBD message (defined by Iridium as [...] "mobile originated SBD"). A real-world example of the 9602 chipset in use are the YB Tracker or the owa3x embedded Linux computer.|$|E

50|$|The {{source address}} {{is the one}} in the IPv6 header. The <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> is the final destination; if the IPv6 packet does not contain a Routing header, that will be the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> in the IPv6 header; otherwise, at the {{originating}} node, it will be the address in the last element of the Routing header, and, at the receiving node, it will be the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> in the IPv6 header.

5000|$|Ethernet frames with a {{value of}} 1 in the least-significant bit of the first octet of the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> are treated as {{multicast}} frames and are flooded to all points on the network. While frames with ones in all bits of the <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> (...) are {{sometimes referred to as}} broadcasts, Ethernet network equipment generally does not distinguish between multicast and broadcast frames. Modern Ethernet controllers filter received packets to reduce CPU load, by looking up the hash of a multicast <b>destination</b> <b>address</b> in a table, initialized by software, which controls whether a multicast packet is dropped or fully received.|$|E

50|$|Routers {{that support}} {{differentiated}} service {{not only have}} to look up the output interface for the <b>destination</b> <b>address,</b> but need to send the packet to the interface that best matches the differentiated services requirements.
