40|$|Intraspinal <b>dermoid</b> and epidermoid <b>tumors</b> are two histopathological subtypes of {{cutaneous}} inclusion {{tumors of the}} spine. This classification {{is based}} on obsolete embryological knowledge. In fact, according to current embryology, both tumor types consist of ectodermal derivatives. Therefore, we hypothesized that <b>dermoid</b> and epidermoid <b>tumors</b> do not differ in clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract Mature cystic teratomas, or <b>dermoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> are {{the most}} common benign ovarian {{neoplasms}} in young women. Malignant transformation is rare, and occurs in less than 2 % of the cases. The heterogeneous histological composition of these tumors may be responsible for the occasional elevation of various tumor markers, such as Ca 19 - 9 and Ca 125. We describe one case of mature cystic teratoma in a 50 -year old woman with the second highest level of Ca 19 - 9 (8922. 76 UI/mL) described in the literature. We concluded that abnormal levels of Ca 19 - 9 are not necessarily associated with ovarian malignancy, and may lead to unnecessary medical intervention and patient anxiety. Therefore, the clinical features, imaging studies and antigen testing should be interpreted carefully, and should not limit the surgical approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{two cases}} of neotropical {{echinococcosis}} caused by Echinococcus oligarthrus and E. vogeli, {{neither of which}} has been reported from Suriname. Case 1, a six-year-old boy, presented a 15 3 25 mm retro-ocular cystic tumor (observed by ultrasound, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging) causing exophthalmia, chemosis, palpebral ptosis, and blindness of the left eye. Of two tentative diagnoses, Echinococcus cyst or <b>dermoid</b> <b>tumor,</b> the former was shown to be correct at surgery when a clear liquid and detached protoscoleces were aspirated. Rostellar hooks of the protoscolex were characteristic of E. oligarthrus. Case 2, a 41 -year-old man, had polycystic masses excised from the liver and abdomen.

Case Report: At 27 weeks of gestation, a patient was diagnosed with advanced EST, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage IIIc, by magnetic resonance imaging and surgery. Following optimal debulking surgery, three cycles of multi-agent chemotherapy, consisting of 25 mg/m 2 cisplatin and 100 mg/m 2 etoposide on days 1 to 4, were instituted at 21 -day intervals. Maternal serum !-fetoprotein and CA 125 titers soon returned to normal pregnancy levels. A healthy male infant was delivered at 38 weeks of gestation by cesarean section, after which a second-look laparotomy was performed. The micropathologic findings were negative for malignancy, except that a <b>dermoid</b> <b>tumor</b> of the right ovary was confirmed.

40|$|Mature teratomas {{are common}} ovarian tumors. Malignant {{transformation}} of dermoid cysts {{is a very}} rare phenomenon observed in only 0. 17 – 2 % of patients. Squamous cell carcinoma {{is the most common}} form of malignant transformation within ovarian <b>dermoid</b> <b>tumors,</b> accounting for more than 80 % of cases. Adenocarcinomas, fibrosarcomas, carcinoid and mixed tumors also occur. Peritoneal gliomatosis is a rare condition, which also should be considered in patients diagnosed with teratoma. There are no sensitive and specific methods for the preoperative differential diagnosis of malignant vs. benign tumors arising in teratomas. Higher risk of malignancy is seen in large tumors, in women over 45 years of age, at elevated tumor markers (CA- 125, CA 19 - 9, CEA, SCC-Ag in particular) and in the case of the presence of solid fragments in cysts. Extended diagnostic imaging using magnetic resonance or positron emission tomography is helpful in such cases. The treatment of mature teratoma, regardless of whether there is a suspicion of focal malignancy, involves surgical excision of the tumor.

40|$|Background: Congenital dermoid cysts {{are very}} rare, constituting less than 1 % of {{intracranial}} tumors. Spontaneous rupture of <b>dermoid</b> <b>tumor</b> is a potentially serious complication {{that can lead}} to meningitis, seizures, cerebral ischemia and hydrocephalus. Occasionally, dermoid tumors are incidentally discovered on computed tomography (CT) of the brain or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following unrelated clinical complaints. They are also discovered during radiologic investigations of unexplained headaches, seizures, and rarely olfactory delusions. Case Report: In this report we describe a patient complaining of vertigo caused by spontaneous rupture of dermoid cyst, preoperatively diagnosed by CT and MRI. Cranial CT revealed a dense fatty lesion adjacent to the posterolateral parasellar region on the left with multiple small, dense fat droplets scattered in the subarachnoid space corresponding to a dermoid cyst rupture. Cranial MRI sections revealed a lesion with mixed-signal-intensity and multiple hyperintense droplets scattered through the cerebellar surface on the left. No enhancement was found on axial T 1 -weighted MRI after intravenous Gadolinium administration. Diffusion weighted image (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient map studies exhibited explicit restricted diffusion. Discussion: Many studies and literature case reports concerning the rupture of dermoid cyst have been reported. However, multimodal imaging of this rare pathology in the same patient is uncommon. Although dermoid cysts are pathognomonic in appearance on a CT examination, the MRI is also of value in helping to understand the effect of extension and pressure of the mass.

Primary dermoids of the urinary bladder extremely rare and secondary dermoid cysts of the bladder—perforation of the bladder arising from an ovarian of paravesical dermoid tumors are un-common. This disease was first reported by Wallace in 1700. W allace first drew attention to the phenomenon of the passage of hairs during micturition. In 1895 Clado collected 32 cases of paravesical dermoid cysts from the literature. In 1913 Heller collected 59 cases of dermoid cysts of bladder, in 16 of which the patients was male. Recently in 1939, Litski r eported a case and stated the tota l number of 15 cases in the literature. Since then there is no articlet except of one case report. In Japan, Matubara and Amano first reported a case of se c o ndary dermoid cyst of the bladder of a 14 -year-old girl in 1899. Since then, isolated single cases have been reported.

40|$|STUDY AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine for the first time the {{frequency}} of Internet use for medical purposes by patients in Switzerland. METHODS: In 2001 over a period of one month, 1604 patients at 8 medical practices in Switzerland completed a self-administered questionnaire on their access to the Internet and any search for medical information using this media. The attending physician supplied the patient's diagnosis and information on the severity of the disorder motivating the visit using a separate questionnaire. RESULTS: 46 % of the patients included in the study had a personal computer, 33 % had an Internet connection and 10 % used the Internet to find medical information. Age was inversely associated with the probability of having an Internet access, whereas educational level and command of the English language were factors directly associated with this. Among those patients with access to the Internet, young adults (25 to 44 years) and those with knowledge of the English language searched for medical information significantly more frequently. Furthermore, patients attending urban medical practices and those with a more severe level of disease more often sought health care information on the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients in Switzerland who search for medical information on the Internet is similar to the rates observed in European English-speaking countries. The Internet allows patients to actively search for information concerning their own health problems but is not currently the most common source of information used by patients. Since health professionals generate, directly or indirectly, most of the medical information published on the Internet, additional research is needed to better understand patients' needs and expectations concerning medical information using this media.

40|$|Abstract. Pure primary ovarian {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare lesion that usually arises from the malignant transformation of an existing ovarian dermoid cyst. The de novo occurrence of an ovarian SCC {{in the absence of}} a prior ovarian <b>dermoid</b> cyst, Brenner <b>tumor</b> or endometriosis is extremely rare. At present, no effective therapy exists for treating pure primary ovarian SCC. The present case study describes a patient that presented with progressive coughing, who was diagnosed with an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IV pure primary ovarian SCC with lung metastases. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy, however, the patient succumbed to the disease. The current study also presents a review of the literature...|$|R
