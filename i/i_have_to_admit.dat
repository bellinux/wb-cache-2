5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of}} the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that I like what he's doing.|$|E
60|$|And smooth! Polished glass {{could not}} be more so. Finally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that at last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{discovered}} a Barsoomian fortification which I could not negotiate.|$|R
60|$|That was a puzzler, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it. <b>I</b> didn't {{know how}} much time had elapsed and neither did Perry, for time is nonexistent in Pellucidar.|$|R
6000|$|... "First of all, I {{denied the}} most {{damaging}} statement--that I {{knew nothing about the}} thing. It seemed necessary to prove the contrary, which I did, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the borrowing." ...|$|R

500|$|LA Weekly {{reported}} that McG, {{the director of}} Terminator Salvation, had a copy of [...] "Bale Out" [...] on his iPod. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> that dance remix [...] is pretty hot," [...] said McG {{in an interview with}} Fast Company. In an interview with [...] to discuss Terminator: Salvation, Christian Bale said he had heard the remix and commented: [...] "It was a good remix; they did a good job." [...] Bale said he had received a remix of his outburst from a friend: [...] "They did a bloody good job! I've gotta say, what a great impulse, you know? To take something ugly like that and make it into a dance? That's a wonderful thing." ...|$|E
500|$|One notable {{citation}} as {{an influence}} was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "I {{was trying to}} write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it [...] When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I {{should have been in}} that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 In Utero at the request of Cobain.|$|E
60|$|I {{stroked the}} chin thoughtfully. There was, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> reason {{in what she}} said. None knew better than I how terrible a blow the passing of Anatole would be to Uncle Tom.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Wienand, former NCMI team member, {{wrote of}} his NCMI experiences, [...] "the recent years saw us preoccupied with an ecclesiology that was 'over realized'.... We preached 'model', 'pattern' passionately. But our God is gracious, kind and {{infinitely}} generous. He walked us back... {{to the gospel}} we had so sadly sent to the bookends of our convictions. After 25 years of pastoral ministry <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> a wonderful community that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> erred." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I set out {{to prove}} my point. I told him of our cities, of our army, of our great navy. He came right back at me asking for figures, {{and when he was}} done <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that only in our navy were we numerically superior.|$|R
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
2500|$|Vasić stood {{opposed to}} the Congress of Ba, held by the Chetniks between 25 and 28 January 1944 in the Serbian village of Ba. He was {{particularly}} {{opposed to the}} political concepts laid out by Moljević and socialist politician Živko Topalović, stating: [...] "I {{do not know why}} the Commander [...] needed this congress; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> [...] was a circus of formality as far as I'm concerned." ...|$|E

It’s one of those unique blends that appeals to kids and parents." [...] Michelle Lincaster of AllVoices, on the airing of the series on Facebook, said [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants has a 16,000,000 fan following on Facebook so the premiere of The Legends of Bikini Botto on Facebook shouldn't come as a surprise." ...|$|E
5000|$|The more I {{studied the}} Bible, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the {{prosperity}} message did not {{line up with}} the tenor of Scripture.

60|$|It {{all seemed}} rather callous to me. Nobody was much {{concerned}} {{for the man}} who was overboard somewhere on that lonely ocean. And yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that everything possible was being done to find him. I talked a little with Mr. Pike, and he seemed more vexed than anything else. He disliked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ship's work interrupted in such fashion.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that this}} diminished {{the value of}} the experiment.

I shall take 'Mitchell's' advice and narrow the circle. Howard, you are a suspect. You are ruled out of the next sitting." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving. Although I {{had nothing to do with}} the concepts behind Peyton’s art, and her drawings are a tiny part of the show, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> I have loved hearing that people out there have connected with the artwork. I have received e-mails from [...] fans who say they love to draw and the artwork on the show is really important to them. How cool is that?! ...|$|E
60|$|From {{all that}} I can learn, few {{incidents}} worthy of remark {{happened in the}} voyage; and it mortifies me exceedingly that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> so noted an expedition into my work without making any more of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't impress people," [...] {{explained}} Colby, {{picking up}} the guitar again. [...] "I don't inspire confidence.

5000|$|Mrs McEvoy [...] is {{the woman}} whom Daisy and Piper are sent to during the war. She is {{described}} as too nice and cheery, but Daisy overlooks this because [...] "at least {{she was trying to}} be nice which even <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> is something". Mrs McEvoys husband (Major McEvoy) was shot dead by the occupying troops while trying to save Joe and this drives her mad.|$|R
60|$|I {{lay in a}} hide chair {{ten hours}} {{together}} that Sunday, only moving to light the stove for Harry, or to consume another pint of strong green tea, which is generally our sole indulgence on the prairie. It might not, however, have suited fastidious palates, because the little squirrel-like gophers which abounded everywhere, burrowing near by, fell into the well by scores, and we <b>had</b> no leisure <b>to</b> fish them out. Neither is there any mistaking the flavor of gopher extract. Meantime it grew hotter and drier, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> myself that the crop might have been better, while Harry, to hide his misgivings, talked cheerfully about higher prices, until at last the crisis came.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 April 2007, {{after being}} {{included}} in the squad due to an injury to the club's new loan signing Andrew Cole, he scored twice as a substitute as they beat local rivals Coventry City 3-0. Manager Steve Bruce stated, [...] "I {{made a big mistake}} by leaving him out of the sixteen and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>to</b> him and apologise to him for that.

60|$|Poppleton I {{had known}} before slightly. I {{used to see}} him at the club. In club {{surroundings}} he always struck me as an ineffable young ass, loud and talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules.

40|$|Before {{embarking on}} this {{exchange}} venture in British general practice <b>I</b> <b>had</b> many preconceived impressions {{of what it}} might be like to be an English family physician. Early in my five months of group practice it became apparent that many of my attitudes had no real basis and in fact <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> many aspects of the British health system were indeed superior. It has been my impression that a group general practice in Great Britain can certainly afford the practising family doctor a stimulating and rewarding professional and social life...|$|R
50|$|It {{was around}} this time that Sibelius finally {{abandoned}} his cherished aspirations as a violinist:My tragedy was that I {{wanted to be a}} celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink — unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long {{and it was a very}} painful awakening when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you find}} any old clothes of the Snake family?" [...] she demanded. Then as Peter {{shook his head}} her tongue ran on without {{waiting for him to}} reply. [...] "Cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of Snake skin in their nest," [...] said she. [...] "Why they want it, {{goodness}} knows! But they do want it and never can seem to settle down to housekeeping unless they have it. Perhaps they think it will scare robbers away. As for me, I should have a cold chill every time I got into my nest if I had to sit on anything like that. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that Cresty and his wife are a handsome couple, and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house, more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking. But Snake skins! Ugh!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{put these}} things down because they puzzle me. I think I {{was in love}} with Beatrice, as being in love is usually understood; but it was quite a {{different}} state altogether from my passionate hunger for Marion, or my keen, sensuous desire for and pleasure in Effie. These were selfish, sincere things, fundamental and instinctive, as sincere as the leap of a tiger. But until matters drew to a crisis with Beatrice, there was an immense imaginative insurgence of a quite different quality. I am setting down here very gravely, and perhaps absurdly, what are no doubt elementary commonplaces for innumerable people. This love that grew up between Beatrice and myself was, I think--I put it quite tentatively and rather curiously--romantic love. That unfortunate and truncated affair of my uncle and the Scrymgeour lady was really of the same stuff, if a little different in quality. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that. The factor of audience was of primary importance in either else.|$|E
60|$|She could appear, at times, he says, {{as real as}} you or I, {{and again}} came mystery all about her. There were times when {{it seemed to him}} you might have hurt her or killed her as you can hurt and kill anyone--with a {{penknife}} for example--and there were times when it seemed to him you could have destroyed the whole material universe and left her smiling still. But of this ambiguous element in the lady, more is to be told later. There are wider seas than ever keel sailed upon, and deeps that no lead of human casting will ever plumb. When it is all summed up, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> I do not know, I cannot tell. I fall back upon Melville and my poor array of collected facts. At first there was amazingly little strangeness about her for any who had to deal with her. There she was, palpably solid and material, a lady out of the sea.|$|E
40|$|When I got to {{the bakery}} I was in a shit mood. I stood in line behind bratty Manhattan kids, howling and crying about what they wanted their parents to buy them.

60|$|I {{questioned}} Juag {{upon the}} feasibility of attempting to cross {{to the mouth of}} the great river of which he had told me, and up which he said we might paddle almost to Sari; but he urged me not to attempt it, since we had but a single paddle and no water or food. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the wisdom of his advice, but the desire to explore this great waterway was strong upon me, arousing in me at last a determination to make the attempt after first gaining the mainland and rectify-ing our deficiencies.|$|R
