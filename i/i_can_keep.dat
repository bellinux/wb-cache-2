500|$|Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote {{a letter}} to Johannes Stricker, one which he {{described}} to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his [...] "persistence is disgusting". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her for as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> my hand in the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E

[...] In November 2015, Scott confirmed that Alien: Covenant would be the first of three additional films in the Alien prequels series, before linking up with the original Alien and stated that the Prometheus sequels would reveal who created the xenomorph aliens. The screenplay for the third prequel film, called Alien: Awakening, was written during production of Alien: Covenant and was finished in 2017, with production scheduled to begin in 2018. In March 2017, Scott said, ”If you really want a franchise, <b>i</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> cranking it for another six. I'm not going to close it down again. No way." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 13, 2017, Rodman {{returned}} to North Korea {{on what was}} initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. [...] "My purpose is {{to go over there}} and try to see if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> bringing sports to North Korea," [...] Rodman said. He added that he hoped to accomplish [...] "something that's pretty positive." [...] During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage. Rodman was not able to meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation's Minister of Sports and handed off several gifts for Kim Jong Un, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump's 1987 book, [...] "".

She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flight 843, {{carrying}} 143 {{passengers and}} 10 crew members, took off around 2:00 pm PST on Monday, June 28, 1965. After {{going through the}} pre-flight check-list, Captain Charles Kimes, 44, let his co-pilot, Fred Miller, 47, handle the take-off. As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of approximately 800 feet, the number 4 (outer-right) engine exploded, rupturing the right outboard fuel tank and igniting the fuel inside.
