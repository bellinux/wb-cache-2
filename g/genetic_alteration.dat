5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial <b>genetic</b> <b>alteration</b> helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{development}} in man {{appeared to be}} a multistage process as suggested by epidemiological studies on commonly occurring gastric, colon, and breast cancers and also on human retrovirus-related leukemia, and by the finding by physicians and surgeons of precancerous lesions for many types of neoplasias. In the last 10 years it has become evident that human cancers have multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> caused by point mutations, recombinations, amplifications, and/or deletions. The genes affected include both oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes and genes that accelerate cell proliferation and metastasis. Cancers with more malignant properties and poorer prognosis are generally associated with larger numbers of <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations.</b> These multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> are considered to be a direct reflection of the multiple steps involved in carcinogenesis. The multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> are caused by multiple environmental carcinogenic substances or factors, each of which usually exists only at minute concentrations and does not exert any major impact alone except under particular occupational, iatrogenic, and locally geographic conditions. The fact that carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> clearly needs to be taken into consideration in assessing the risks of environmental carcinogenic substances or factors. The increasing incidence of multiple primary cancers is also most easily understood from the viewpoint of multiple steps in carcinogenesis. Possible multiple approaches to cancer prevention should therefore be considered in relation to multistep carcinegenesis and multiple carcinogenic factors...|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes, {{as in the}} {{writings}} of Leon Kass, the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed. In his 2002 book Our Posthuman Future and in a 2004 Foreign Policy magazine article, political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism as the world's most dangerous idea because he believes that it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy (in general) and liberal democracy (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of [...] "human nature". Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his 2003 book The Future of Human Nature, in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another's unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human [...] "species ethic" [...] would be undermined by embryo-stage <b>genetic</b> <b>alteration.</b> Critics such as Kass, Fukuyama and a variety of authors hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the social order. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the [...] "naturalizing" [...] of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes. AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Marvin Minsky and Hans Moravec, which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.|$|E

While most patients presenting superficial disease {{can be expected to}} do well following treatment, still many patients will return to our office with muscle invasive and metastatic disease. Survival in advanced bladder cancer is less than 50 %. Tumors of similar histologic grade and stage have variable behavior, suggesting that <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> must be present to explain the diverse behavior of bladder cancer. It is hoped that through the study of the subtle <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in bladder cancer, important prognostic and therapeutic targets can be exploited. Many new diagnostic tests and gene therapy approaches rely on the identification and targeting of these unique <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations.</b> A review of literature published on the molecular genetics of bladder cancer from 1970 to the present was conducted. A variety of molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> have been identified in bladder cancer. Oncogenes (H-ras, erbB- 2, EGFR, MDM 2, C-MYC, CCND 1), tumor suppressor genes (p 53, Rb, p 21, p 27 /KIP 1, p 16, PTEN, STK 15, FHIT, FEZI/LZTS 1, bc 10), telomerase, and methylation have all been studied in bladder cancer. Several have proven to be potentially useful clinical targets in the prognosis and therapy of bladder cancer such as staining for p 53 and gene therapy strategies such as p 53 and fezl. Clinical trials targeting HER 2 /neu and the EGFR pathways are underway. The UroVysion bladder cancer assay relies on FISH to detect <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in this disease. Continuing identification of the molecular <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> in bladder cancer will enhance future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to bladder cancer.

In this study, we combined statistical analyses and computational modeling to explain patterns of <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> seen in 178 patients with bladder tumors (either muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive). A statistical analysis on frequently altered genes identified pair associations, including co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity. Focusing on <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> of protein-coding genes involved in growth factor receptor signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis entry, we complemented this analysis with a literature search to focus on nine pairs of <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> of our dataset, with subsequent verification in three other datasets available publicly. To understand the reasons and contexts of these patterns of associations while accounting for the dynamics of associated signaling pathways, we built a logical model. This model was validated first on published mutant mice data, then used to study patterns and to draw conclusions on counter-intuitive observations, allowing one to formulate predictions about conditions where combining <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> benefits tumorigenesis. For example, while CDKN 2 A homozygous deletions occur {{in a context of}} FGFR 3 -activating mutations, our model suggests that additional PIK 3 CA mutation or p 21 CIP deletion would greatly favor invasiveness. Furthermore, the model sheds light on the temporal orders of gene alterations, for example, showing how mutual exclusivity of FGFR 3 and TP 53 mutations is interpretable if FGFR 3 is mutated first. Overall, our work shows how to predict combinations of the major gene alterations leading to invasiveness through two main progression pathways in bladder cancer...|$|R

As carcinogenesis has been suggested to be a multistep process involving sequential accumulation of multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations,</b> morphological heterogeneity may represent a cross-sectional view of <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> within individual tumors. We therefore examined the topographical distribution of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events within 10 non-small-cell lung cancers to investigate whether, and which, <b>genetic</b> <b>alterations</b> are accumulated in relation to morphological progression. LOH at the TP 53, 17 p 13. 3, and 3 p loci was detected in six, eight, and six of 10 informative cases, respectively.
