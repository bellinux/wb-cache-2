40|$|The {{effect of}} {{infection}} of mink with aleutian disease virus {{on the level}} of natural antibodies in the serum was investigated. The level of natural antibodies to chicken red blood cells was increased following infection but there was no correlation between the degree of hypergamma <b>globulinemia</b> in the diseased mink and the increase in titers. On the other hand, serum levels of natural hemolytic antibodies to sheep red blood cells in mink did not increase during the course of aleutian disease. These data indicate that the aleutian disease virus does not stimulate a broad spectrum of pre-existing antibody producing cells...|$|E
40|$|The common {{pathological}} {{condition of the}} shoulder joint is rotator cuff diseases. Patient, 68 years, had pain in the shoulder with limited joint mobility. After clinical examination, blood tests (SE > 100 nmol/L, CSF normal, hypergamma- <b>globulinemia)</b> and radiographic examination (bone dilution with deformities of the humeral head), a solitary plasmocytoma was suspected. This diagnosis was excluded after biopsy. Patient was referred to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder, so ultrasonographic (US) examination was performed. Our case study points to comparability between US and MRI results regarding tendinitis of muscles in the rotator cuff. By applying both diagnostic methods, calcifications within muscle tendons were evident. Sonography is faster, cheaper, more accessible and readily available method that certainly is a valuable tool for clinicians {{when it comes to}} rotator cuff lesions...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dogs were}} {{presented}} to the clinic {{with the history of}} recurrent dermatological abnormalities, fever, dyspepsia, lethargy and progressive weight loss. Dermatological findings observed were dry exfoliations, alopecia, hemorrhagic spots over abdomen and groin regions, inter digital ulcerative lesions, hyperkeratosis of digital pads, brittleness of nails and pododermatitis. Microscopic examination of the stained peripheral blood smears revealed the Babesia gibsoni organisms in the erythrocytes. Dogs showed anaemia, leucopaenia, thrombocytopenia, hyper <b>globulinemia</b> and low albumin levels. Uneventful recovery was recorded after treatment with intra muscular administration of two doses of diminazene aceturate @ 7. 0 mg/kg body weight and oral administration of clindamycin @ 25 mg/kg body weight twice in a day. Improvement in the clinical findings was noticed by the three days of therapy and complete dermatological clinical cure was obtained after two months of therapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Polyclonal B cell {{activation}} {{is not a}} pe-culiar characteristic to {{a particular}} infection, as many viruses, bacteria, and parasites induce a strong polyclonal B cell response resulting in hy-per [...] <b>globulinemia.</b> Here, we discuss the different roles proposed for polyclonal B cell activation, which can be crucial for early host defense against rapidly dividing microorganisms by contributing antibodies specific for a spectrum of conserved structures present in the pathogens. In addition, polyclonal B cell activation can be responsible for maintenance of memory B cell responses because of the continuous, unrestricted stimulation of memory B cells whose antibody production may be sustained {{in the absence of}} the antigens binding-specific BCR. Conversely, polyclonal activation can be triggered by microorganisms to avoid the host-specific, immune response by activating B cell clones, which produce nonmicroorganism-specific antibod-ies. Finally, some reports suggest a deleterious role for polyclonal activation, arguing that it could poten-tially turn on anti-self-responses and lead to autoim-mune manifestations during chronic infections.

40|$|DURING {{the last}} five years the authors have studied the electrophoretic {{patterns}} of the serum proteins from approximately 2, 000 patients who suf-fered from the wide variety of pathologic conditions encountered in general hospital practice. Throughout this period, interest has been directed to the clinical significance of protein moieties with abnormal electrophoretic mobil-ities, and within the last year, especial attention has been focused upon a component which migrates between alpha- 2 and beta globulins. Since there is confusion in the literature regarding the designation of abnormal serum proteins migrating between alpha- 2 and beta globulins, a chronologic resume of pertinent nomenclature is presented in table 1. In 1951 Bernfeld and co-workers 4 reported a protein with mobility midway between alpha- 2 and beta globulins in serum from a patient with neurogenic sarcoma of the kidney. The authors designated this protein fraction "alpha- 3 globulin. " In 1953 Bernfeld and associates 5 reported "alpha- 3 " <b>globulinemia</b> in a case of rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of infected mink of non-Aleutian genotype naturally resists progression to immune complex disease. The nature of the AD resistance is presumably genetic. While hypergammaglubulinemia can be insensitively detected by an iodine test, more sensitive diagnosis of hyper-γ <b>globulinemia</b> and of other serum protein parameters associated with an immune-complex disease is currently cost prohibitive, time consuming, and laborious. Thus, practical, cost effective, sensitive, and high throughput tests for in vivo markers of disease vs. health in AD virus infected animals are currently not available. Such markers could have potential practical use in selection of AD virus infected animals for disease resistance. In this study, initially, parameters for serum protein MALDI-TOF serum analysis were established, and subsequently serum proteins of infected mink (CIEP positive) and mink from ADV uninfected farms were profiled by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. We determined the albumin-γ globulin (A/γ G) ratios and albumin-C reactive protein (A/C) ratios associated with health and disease, and furthermore we identified a 76 Kda protein, associated exclusively with disease, i. e. with pathological A/γ G ratio. We concluded that MALDI-TOF profiles of CIPE positive animals provide practical and cost effective tool for selection of breeders for AD resistant phenotype, which could in turn facilitate on farm resistance breeding programs'...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Paranasal sinuses are {{the common}} place for infectionin {{children}} and adults. Early and effective antibiotic treatment is necessary toreduce the infection period and mucosal injuries, {{and to prevent}} from theInvolvements of orbit or CNS. This article aims to clarify the Serumimmunoglobulins accompanying by Sinusitis in Children. Material and Methods: the Subjects of this Cross-Sectional study were 400 patients with paranasal sinusitis confirmed by imaging techniques. The study wasconducted in infectious and ENT Clinics of Rasoul Akram hospital in 2003 - 2004. We measured the Levels of serum immoglobulins including IgG, IgM, IgA and IgEby standard radio-immunodiffusion test, and Compared with normal range of eachage group. The data was analyzed by SPSS software (11. 5) Results: The Subjects aged 4. 42 ± 2. 62 are both male (70. 7 %) and female (29. 3 %). Maxilla is the most Common Sinus involved. Thirty-eight of them (95 %) haveincreased IgG Level. Forty-four percent of children suffered from rhinosinusitishave been diagnosed with Immune-humoral disorders: the increase of IgE (N= 9),Lack of IgA (N= 3), decrease of Isolated IgG (N= 2), decrease of both IgG and IgA(N= 1) and Hyper IgM syndrome (N= 3). There is Significant Correlation betweendifferent Immunoglobulins and duration of Sinusitis (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} show that an increase of IgE is one of themost Common disorders in children suffering from Sinusitis and the incidence ofimmunity disorders is higher than the expected rate. Thus, we recommend theImmunologic assessment for Children Contracting with Sinusitis, esp. forprotracted one.

40|$|Serum protein {{electrophoresis}} (SPE) uses different gels {{to separate}} proteins. It is mainly indicated to study modifications in protidemia, albuminemia, and <b>globulinemia.</b> Literature suggests {{variability in the}} reference intervals (RI) in the different fraction values, using various SPE gels (1, 2). This study was aimed to calculate the RI of SPE using agarose (AGE) and acetate cellulose (ACE) techniques, to compare the two RIs obtained, and to investigate the causes of hyper-gamma-globulinemia in some samples. Five hundred and fifteen blood samples from European short or long-haired cats (> 1 year old and < 10 years old), from both genders, were collected; 291 samples were tested on ACE (2010 - 2013; MICROTECH 648 ISO, Interlab®, Rome, Italy) and 224 on AGE (2013 - 2014; Pretty, Interlab®, Rome, Italy). One hundred and seventy-nine runs (ACE, 105; AGE, 74) were selected based on the following criteria: total protein, albumin and globulin values in RIs; no alterations both in CBC and serum biochemical profile; no alteration at visual inspection of the SPE run. RIs (median and 90 % CI of absolute and relative values) were calculated using non-parametric Robust method (Medcalc® software). The Mann-Whitney test {{was used for the}} comparison between the two RIs. Finally, the SPE on AGE in 28 runs with hyper-γ-globulinemia were studied using the clinical records. The following SPE fractions were observed in ACE and AGE: albumin, α 1, α 2, β 1, β 2, and γ globulins. RIs for ACE were (values: absolute g/dL; relative %) : albumin (3. 0 - 3. 9; 43 - 57), globulins (2. 7 - 4. 3; 43 - 57), α 1 (0. 1 - 0. 4; 1 - 5), α 2 (0. 4 - 1. 5; 6 - 20), β 1 (0. 3 - 0. 9; 4 - 14), β 2 (0. 4 - 0. 7; 5 - 10) and γ (0. 4 - 1. 9; 7 - 27). RIs for AGE were: albumin (2. 9 - 3. 9; 42 - 57), globulins (2. 8 - 4. 6; 43 - 58), α 1 (0. 04 - 0. 4; 1 - 5), α 2 (0. 8 - 1. 7; 13 - 22), β 1 (0. 2 - 0. 7; 2 - 9), β 2 (0. 1 - 0. 8; 3 - 10), and γ (0. 6 - 2; 9 - 27). Some sub-fractions were observed (# runs) : ACE α 2 A and α 2 B (12), γ 1 and γ 2 (13); AGE α 2 A and α 2 B (62), γ 1 and γ 2 (38). For all fractions (except albumin and γ-globulins) statistically significant differences were observed between ACE and AGE (P< 0. 05). Cats with hyper-γ-globulinemia (n= 28) were diagnosed with: Renal failure (17) staged by IRIS; Feline Infectious Peritonitis (1); Squamous cell carcinoma (3); FIV Positive (2); FeLV Positive (1); Mandibular abscess (1); Multicentric and Gastrointestinal lymphoma (2) and one suspected of Toxoplasma spp infection. Literature about feline RIs in SPE is inadequate, regardless the type of gel employed. In AGE runs we detected more frequently α 2 and γ-globulin sub-fractions that should be further investigated for their clinical significance. Statistically differences between ACE and AGE in European cats were observed and AGE showed a better electrophoretic resolution. The SPE is a semi-quantitative method for protein fractions differentiation, but it can provide a diagnostic orientation...|$|E
