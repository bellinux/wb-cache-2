5|$|Jerry Lynn was Special Guest Referee for {{the next}} {{encounter}} between A.J. Styles and Sean Waltman. Styles bleed from the nose during the match. Styles gained a near-fall on Waltman after performing his signature Styles Clash maneuver and slamming Waltman face-first into the mat. Waltman also gained a near-fall following his signature X-Factor maneuver and forcing Styles face-first into the mat. Later, Styles jumped from the ring apron over the top rope and Waltman in a sunset flip. Waltman held onto the ropes, trying to prevent a pin attempt, until Lynn kicked his <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> top rope. Styles then rolled through and lifted Waltman up to perform the Styles Clash at 14 minutes and 37 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his <b>hands</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver is}} {{responsible}} for {{checking to see if}} the representative box on the screen correctly identifies the parking space; if the space is large enough to park, the box will be green in color; if the box is incorrectly placed, or lined in red, using the arrow buttons moves the box until it turns green. Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal. When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal, the car will then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space.|$|E

500|$|Muhammad and Gabriel, having {{transformed}} into eagles to observe Jakarta, see prostitution, adultery, theft, and drinking. Muhammad is shocked that zina and theft continue unabated, calling for Gabriel {{to help him}} stone the adulterers and cut the <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> thieves. Gabriel replies {{that there are not}} enough stones for the adulterers, and the swords have been replaced by guns bought by the [...] "infidel" [...] Soviets and Americans who [...] "worship dollars". They later see a minister, referred to only as Togog, attempting to use the Gilchrist Document to overthrow Sukarno. Muhammad gives up on Indonesia, planning to install television in jannah.|$|E
500|$|After a {{thorough}} pre-flight check I would take off and, once at circuit height, I would trim the aircraft {{and try to}} get her to fly straight and level with <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stick... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers. Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine, calibrated for height and temperature... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was criticized}} for his autocratic {{coaching}} style and strained relationships, Brown {{played a significant role}} in the evolution and modernization of football. The draw play he invented – a formation in which the quarterback drops back to pass but then <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ball to a running back – is still in wide use. In his autobiography, Brown said the play came about by accident in 1946 when Graham botched a play and improvised by making a late handoff to Marion Motley, who ran past the onrushing defenders for a large gain. He developed detailed pass patterns that were designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the defense. [...] Brown is also credited with the creation of the passer's pocket, an offensive line protection scheme that is designed to buy a quarterback a few extra precious seconds to find the open receiver.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1909, {{three months}} after Latham joined the company, he at last {{realized}} his potential and flew for 37.5 minutes at a speed of 45mph at a height of just over [...] A week later he set the European non-stop flight record at 1 hour and 7 minutes which seriously challenged the Wrights' world record. During this flight he took his <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel, took a cigarette out of his silver case and smoked it in his ivory holder, [...] thus creating a new record. This delighted Levavasseur because it showcased the aeroplane's stability when being flown with <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> controls. [...] Then on June 6, 1909, Latham won the Prix Ambroise Goupy for flying a straight-line course of six kilometres in 4 minutes, 13 seconds. These flights convinced Levavasseur that Latham was clearly his best pilot and he was named the company's premier pilot. [...] Furthermore, based {{on the length of}} the flights Latham was conducting, Levavasseur was satisfied that his Antoinette IV monoplane was sufficiently reliable for a 45 minute-to-1 hour continuous flight and therefore Latham could attempt to fly across the English Channel to win a £1,000 (US$5,000 1910) prize offered by the Daily Mail.|$|E
2500|$|Envoys {{were sent}} to the Samnites with the {{introductions}} to request that they, in view of their mutual friendship with Rome, spare territory which had become the possession of Rome and, if this was not heeded, to warn them to keep their <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> city of Capua and the territory of Campania. [...] The envoys delivered their message as instructed to the Samnites' national assembly. [...] They were met with a defiant response, [...] "not only did the Samnites declare their intention of waging war against Capua, but their magistrates left the council chamber, and in tones loud enough for the envoys to hear, ordered [...] to march out at once into Campanian territory and ravage it." [...] When this news reached Rome, the fetials {{were sent to}} demand redress, and when this was refused [...] Rome declared war against the Samnites.|$|E

Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar. All glory to Allah". Al-Hammouri also warned U.S. president Barack Obama that there is an impending rise of a united Muslim empire that will instill religious law on all of its subjects.|$|E
