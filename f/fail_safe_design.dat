50|$|The 17:30 Virgin West Coast Pendolino West Coast Main Line InterCity {{service from}} London Euston to Glasgow Central derailed at 20:15 at a faulty {{set of points}} almost {{immediately}} after crossing the Docker Viaduct (the rear half of the train would still have been crossing the bridge whilst the front derailed at the points). The train {{was reported to have}} been travelling at 95 mph when it was derailed. The train consisted of unit 390033 City of Glasgow, which was constructed at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, in 2002, and consisted of nine carriages. It carried 105 passengers and four crew.Passengers said that the carriages of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing and most of the train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.The train's derailment caused severe damage to the Overhead Line Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting {{in a number of other}} electric-powered services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{failure is}} caused due to {{fluctuating}} loads {{and is one}} of the most common type of failure in mechanical structures. Fatigue damage starts with nucleation, crack formation and then propagation of the crack. Estimation of safe life of critical components becomes very essential in <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> tolerant <b>design</b> for certification. Total life of a component generally consists of two stages viz. crack initiation and crack propagation. The proportion which each contributes will vary with the geometry, the loading and especially with the material. Crack growth behaviour is a major issue in scheduling of inspection and maintenance in variety of industries especially in aircraft industry. Here, failure leads to catastrophic consequences and loss of life. When aircraft reach the end of their service life, fatigue cracks are found to have developed along rivet holes and other highly stressed regions of the aircraft. In order to extend the life of these aircraft, repairs are made to arrest these cracks. This is because huge financial costs involved in manufacturing of aircrafts. Hence, extending the life of in-service aircrafts can provide huge savin...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} performed {{to determine the best}} structural approach for design of primary wing and fuselage structure of a Mach 2. 7 arrow wing supersonic cruise aircraft. Concepts were evaluated considering near term start of design. Emphasis was placed on the complex interactions between thermal stress, static aeroelasticity, flutter, fatigue and <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>design,</b> static and dynamic loads, and the effects of variations in structural arrangements, concepts and materials on these interactions. Results indicate that a hybrid wing structure incorporating low profile convex beaded and honeycomb sandwich surface panels of titanium alloy 6 Al- 4 V were the most efficient. The substructure includes titanium alloy spar caps reinforced with boron polyimide composites. The fuselage shell consists of hat stiffened skin and frame construction of titanium alloy 6 Al- 4 V. A summary of the study effort is presented, and a discussion of the overall logic, design philosophy and interaction between the analytical methods for supersonic cruise aircraft design are included...|$|E
40|$|Thin rimmed and webbed gears {{are used}} in {{particular}} applications to reduce systems weight. This kind of gears need an accurate and <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>design.</b> As a matter of fact, a possible failure, due to bending fatigue, consists in crack nucleation and consequent growth, in particular in the tooth root zone. These cracks may propagate through the tooth or through the rim. Crack propagation direction is basically influenced by the wheel geometry parameters, above all the rim thickness. Studies available in literature emphasize three ranges for the backup ratio values, involving different behaviors. These ranges {{are related to the}} crack propagation paths; respectively through the tooth, through the rim and in an unforeseeable way. This last uncertainty zone depends on other parameters, related to both geometry and loading conditions. In this work the effect of wheel speed related to the bending load has been investigated. The investigation has been carried out by means of numerical models involving both 2 D finite element and extended finite element models (XFEM). Results shows that both crack initiation point and crack propagation path are strongly influenced by centrifugal load; this effect is mainly evident in the uncertainty zone of the backup rati...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{understanding}} of the parameters which control composite fracture is imperative {{to the implementation of}} <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>design</b> and inspection of critical load bearing structures. For isotropic materials, fracture is essentially controlled by a single parameter, e. g., the fracture toughness or the stress-intensity factor. This one dimensional nature lends itself to experimental quantification. However, for anisotropic composites there are at least seven primary controlling parameters: 1) crack length; 2) crack orientation with respect to material axis of anisotropy; 3) nature of applied combined stresses; 4) lamination geometry; 5) deformational and strength resp 011 Ses of the constituent lamina; 6) three kinematically admissible modes of crack extension and 7) crack trajectory. Because of this large number of parameters, experimental quantification by system~tic permutation of the parameters must be realistically viewed as intractable. This paper presents an analytical method of reducing these parameters from seven to two and furnishes experimental observations-nich lend support to the theoretical model. An experimental p~gram is conducted on fiberglass reinforced epoxy where a centrally notched-crack is subjected to combined loading. Several lamination geometries are tested and by varying the external combined loading, different crack trajectories are predicted by the theoretical model. These predicted trajectories agree well with the experimental observed fracture mode. Such agreement suggests that with further refinement, the general condition of laminated fracture can be characterized...|$|E

40|$|Crack {{propagation}} in gears is {{a problem}} related {{not only to the}} life of the components, but also to the concept of failsafe design. <b>Fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>design</b> means to design a component in order that, if a failure occurs, this may cause a "safe failure". This aspect is very important above all in aerospace industry. As a matter of fact, in aerospace application, the need of reducing weight brings to produce gears with very thick rim and web. Considering thin rim gears, when a crack is nucleated near the tooth root, it may propagate through the tooth (causing the loss of the entire tooth or a portion of it) or the propagation may follow a path across the wheel diameter (causing the projection of big parts of the gear that may break the gearbox and may cause serious damage to the aircraft). The first failure mode is define as "failsafe failure" and the second one as "catastrophic failure" and of course has to be avoided. Designers need to have robust design criteria in order to predict crack propagation paths and to avoid catastrophic failures. In literature, few works are present concerning this topic, in particular related to the effect of geometrical parameters that may affect the crack propagation. In this work a numerical analysis about crack propagation in gears with respect to the backup ratio (ratio between tooth height and rim thickness), initial crack position and shape has been done by means of the Extended FEM (XFEM) technique, realizing 3 D models. XFEM 3 D is a relatively new technique consisting in enriching traditional finite elements with more complex shape functions; in this way it is possible to propagate crack also between mesh nodes and to have mesh independent results. Aim of this paper is to highlight the crack propagation path in order to give to designers an high confident design criterion, related to the gear geometry. In particular, the effect of both rim thickness and orientation of the initial crack have been considered in order to enrich the literature knowledge. Numerical results obtained in this work have been compared with those found in the literature, showing a very good correlatio...|$|E
