40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{compressibility}} of directly compressible tableting material designed for preparation of matrix tablets and further investigated {{the rate of}} drug release from hydrophilic and lipophilic matrix tablets with two types of co-processed dry binders. The hydrophilic matrix tablets contained carbomers (Carbopol® 71 G NF), the lipophilic matrix tablets contained <b>glycerol</b> <b>dibehenate</b> (Compritol® 888 ATO). The used co-processed excipients were silicified microcrystalline cellulose Prosolv® SMCC 90 and MicroceLac® 100 containing α-lactose monohydrate and microcrystalline cellulose in the ratio of 3 : 1. The compressibility was evaluated by energetic profile of compression and the tensile strength of the tablets. The dissolution test was performed using the method of the rotating basket. The total energy of compression increased with compression force, higher values showed the tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90. Plasticity decreased with compression force, higher values showed the tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90. The strength of tablets increased with compression force, tablets with Prosolv® SMCC 90 were harder. The lipophilic matrix tablets released drugs more slowly than the hydrophilic gel matrix tablets. The fastest drug release was from tablets with 15 % Carbopol® 71 G NF...|$|E
40|$|This thesis evaluates {{and compares}} {{compressibility}} of directly compressible tableting {{materials for the}} preparation of matrix tablets containing ascorbic acid. Avicel® PH 102 {{was used as the}} dry binder. The hydrophilic matrix tablets contained carbomers (Carbopol® 71 G NF) or hypromellose (MethocelTM K 15 M) in concentration of 20 % or both in concentration of 10 %, the lipophilic matrix tablets contained <b>glycerol</b> <b>dibehenate</b> (Compritol® 888 ATO). The dual matrix tablets contained both types of retarding materials in concentration of 10 %. Sodium stearyl fumarate was used as the lubricant in concentration of 1 %. The compressibility was evaluated by means of the energy profile of the compression process and determination of tensile strength of the tablets. The total energy of compression increased with the increase of compression force, the tableting material with 20 % of MethocelTM K 15 M showed the highest values. Plasticity decreased with compression force, the tableting material with 20 % of Carbopol® G and the tableting material with MethocelTM K 15 M showed the highest values. The tensile strength of tablets increased with compression force, the strongest tablets were the ones containing 20 % of Compritol® 888 ATO, with the exception of compression force of 8 kN. In this case the strongest tables [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis studies {{compressibility}} of tableting {{materials for}} matrix tablets with {{two types of}} coprocessed dry binders, namely Prosolv® SMCC 90 and MicroceLac® 100. Carbomers, concretely Carbopol® 71 G NF, were used as polymers in hydrophilic matrix tablets. <b>Glycerol</b> - <b>dibehenate</b> in Compritol® 888 ATO was used in lipophilic matrix tablets. Concentrations of retardant components were 15 and 30 %. The compressibility of tableting materials was evaluated by energy profile of the compaction process and the tensile strength of tablets. The values of total energy of compression increased with a compression force. Tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90 showed higher values than tableting materials with MicroceLac® 100. The plasticity decreased with the compression force, tableting materials with Prosolv® SMCC 90 showed higher values. For these tableting materials, the highest values were {{in the case of}} mixtures with 15 % concentration of retardant components...|$|R
