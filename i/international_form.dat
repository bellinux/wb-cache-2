25|$|Equations in {{this article}} are written using the International System of Quantities (ISQ). This is the modern (post-1970s) {{international}} system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity ε0. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern <b>international</b> <b>form.</b> For clarity, this should always be done.|$|E
25|$|After {{missing the}} first half of the 2006–07 season due to injury, Blackwell had a stint for Otago in New Zealand's State League, scoring 315 runs at 52.50. However, her <b>international</b> <b>form</b> {{remained}} poor and she was dropped midway through an ODI tournament in India after making 54 runs in four innings. She earned a recall midway through the subsequent Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. Blackwell established herself at international level in 2007–08. After making 291 runs at 41.57 in the WNCL, she broke through for her maiden ODI century in the home series against England. She made another fifty later in the series, followed by consecutive half-centuries against New Zealand, ending the international season with 389 runs at 43.22.|$|E
25|$|This <b>international</b> <b>form</b> was not enough, though, to earn Spooner {{selection}} {{in the home}} series against India in 1952, and he made only two further Test appearances. On the English tour of the West Indies in 1953–54, he replaced the injured Evans for the fourth Test on another lifeless pitch at Port of Spain, Trinidad. And finally in 1955, in the final Test at The Oval against South Africa, he won a home Test cap, again when Evans was injured (though Arthur McIntyre had been Evans' replacement in the fourth Test). This final Test, in which England won the series 3–2 late on the last scheduled afternoon, was not a total personal success: Spooner conceded no byes, but failed to score in either innings.|$|E
