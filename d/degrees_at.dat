5|$|The {{summit of}} the volcano has steep slopes inclining from 20 to 30 <b>degrees.</b> <b>At</b> lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their {{inclination}} is about 10 degrees. From there on, foothills stretch almost {{to the edge of}} the Magdalena River, north of the volcano and the Cauca River to the west. On the two major sides of the summit, headwalls show where past rock avalanches occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent's deadliest eruption in 1985. On the volcano's southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of colleges}} and {{universities}} in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. For the purposes of this list, colleges and universities are defined as accredited, degree-granting, postsecondary institutions. Currently, there are several universities, one art school, and one law school, {{as well as a number}} of undergraduate associates and baccalaureate colleges operating in the state. In addition, four out-of-state institutions offer courses and <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> locations in New Hampshire, and fifteen academic institutions were formerly active in the state.|$|E
5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.|$|E

5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|University College was the {{founding}} nondenominational college, created in 1853 after {{the university was}} secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged their students to study for non-divinity <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> University College. In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join. Decades {{after the death of}} John Strachan, the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904, followed in 1910 by St. Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college founded by the Basilian Fathers. Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton, and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.|$|E
5|$|The usual tomb plan {{consisted}} of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, the corridors turn 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as 'Bent Axis', After the burial the upper corridors {{were meant to be}} filled with rubble and the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate 'Jogged Axis' (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this {{and is one of the}} tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally 'Straight Axis' of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the 'well', which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a 'magical' purpose later on as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated, but the well room was still present.|$|E

5|$|Towson United Methodist Church has a 3-manual, 48-rank Casavant {{pipe organ}} of 2,790pipes, {{including}} seven ranks of 16ft. pipes and tubular chimes. It was dedicated {{in memory of}} S. Clayton Seitz by then-organist John Duwane Hoffman on May 11, 1958. Hoffman, the church's esteemed virtuoso organist and Minister of Music between 19571988, {{was a graduate of}} Union Theological Seminary's renowned Master of Sacred Music degree program, after having earned Bachelor of Music and Master of Music <b>degrees</b> <b>at</b> the University of Denver. At Union, Hoffman studied the organ with Clarence Dickinson and Vernon De Tar. In addition to serving as the church's organist and choral director, Hoffman was professor of organ at Towson State University. He died unexpectedly on July 4, 1988 of complications following heart bypass surgery. The church library is named in his memory. Hoffman was succeeded by Kathie Metz, a graduate of Marshall University, as Director of Music and Organist 19882012. The current Director of Music and Organist since July, 2013, is Douglas Hollida. An ordained minister, Rev. Hollida studied music at Shepherd University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and then earned a Master of Divinity degree from Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry.
