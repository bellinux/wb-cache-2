The lock at Welches Dam <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> as being unsafe and a reedbed has taken hold. Very low water levels between Horseway sluice and Welches Dam lock often prevented passage.

5|$|In 1879 {{the bridge}} was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 {{demolished}} and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> many times due to collisions.|$|E
5|$|It took {{sixteen years}} from the initial {{developing}} stage begun in 1994, until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4, 2010. The entire cost of the bridge totaled $336 million. In 2011, the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun, {{and is expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times, the river <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and at least two workers have died.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the road}} was {{bypassed}} in 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then U.S. Route99 (US99), to handle increased traffic and remove many curves. The four-lane US99 was completed in 1953 and replaced by a freeway, Interstate5 (I-5) around 1968. The portion {{of the road}} within the Angeles National Forest {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1997, following the efforts of Harrison Scott. Much of the road <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> by the U.S. Forest Service; other remnants of the road are used by local traffic.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|PA378 heads northward {{across the}} Hill to Hill Bridge, {{at which point}} it crosses back into Lehigh County. The route crosses over West Lehigh Street and intersects with the off-ramp to Main Street in Bethlehem. There was {{formerly}} a ramp to 2nd Avenue, but that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> and is only used by pedestrians. After this interchange, PA378 becomes a four-lane freeway and is named the Fred B. Rooney Highway.

In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> to the public since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating of the Bride, from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was officially}} opened in 2000, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> for {{renovation}} {{since at least}} February 2008.

Though {{there are many other}} entrances, foreign visitors entered approved sections accessed via a small shop front in Qianmen, south of Tiananmen Square, at 62 West Damochang Street. Tour groups could enter free of charge and without prior permission while individual tourists not part of a group were charged 20 yuan (US$2.40) each.|$|E

5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{commenced}} seaplane operates to Værøy from 1965; {{five years}} later the first helicopter services were introduced. Planning of an airport started in the late 1960s, but unfavorable weather conditions prolonged finding a suitable location. The decision to build the airport was taken in 1984, construction began the following year and the airport opened on 1 June 1986. The fatal Widerøe Flight 839 accident took place on 12 April 1990, in which heavy wind caused structural failure of a Twin Otter. The airport <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>closed</b> since; helicopter services commenced in 1993 and Værøy Heliport opened in 1997.|$|E
