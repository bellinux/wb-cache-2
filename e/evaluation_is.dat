The 3D {{model of the}} element to be inspected can be projected in the image plane for more complex shapes.

5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An <b>evaluation</b> <b>is</b> a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have sought}} to {{understand}} the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative <b>evaluations</b> which <b>are</b> of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1).|$|R

40|$|Charles Taylor draws a {{distinction}} between weak and strong <b>evaluations.</b> They <b>are</b> two kinds of evaluative attitudes persons can have towards a variety of objects of evaluation. The possible objects can vary from individual desires, emotions and acts to whole ways of life. Strong <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> stable preferences based on qualitative distinctions concerning the worth of the options. Strong <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> responses to the non-instrumental value of the options, {{and they can be}} mistaken, because the value of the options is not based on the response. By contrast, what Taylor calls "weak evaluations" cannot <b>be</b> mistaken. Weak <b>evaluations</b> make any of their objects weakly valued. This means that strong <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> value-based, and weak evaluations desirebased preferences. Taylor also says that strong evaluations, unlike weak <b>evaluations,</b> <b>are</b> central to one's identity. One's identity is constituted through a strong adherence, a strong identification with and commitment to the values. Thus strong <b>evaluations</b> <b>are</b> stable preferences that are strongly adhered to, and which are based on strong values...|$|R
40|$|A new {{evaluation}} of the neutron cross section standards was recently completed. The results of this work became the standards for the new ENDF/B-VII library. This <b>evaluation</b> <b>was</b> performed to include new experiments on the standards {{that have been made}} since the ENDF/B-VI standards <b>evaluation</b> <b>was</b> completed and to improve the evaluation process. The evaluations include the H(n,n), 6 Li(n,t), 10 B(n, alpha), 10 B(n,alpha 1 gamma), 197 Au(n, gamma), 235 U(n,f), and 238 U(n,f) standard reactions. <b>Evaluations</b> <b>were</b> not done for the 3 He(n,p) and C(n,n) standards which were carried over from ENDF/B-VI.
