The joints {{as well as}} the gripper are cable driven through the <b>instruments</b> <b>shaft.</b> The main topic of this publication is the processing of this micro-scale instrument tip using various production methods for prototyping, e. g. milling, fused deposition modeling, and selective laser micro melting.

Through an abdominal access a laparoscope is inserted to illuminate and capture the internal organs. The latter are shown to the surgeon by appropriate means of visual representation. To manipulate tissue or perform stitching usually two handheld laparoscopic instruments are applied, offering four degrees of freedom (DoF) at the instrument’s tip.

The feasibility of using EVA in laparoscopic settings {{has been tested}} in a box trainer setup. METHODS: EVA makes use of an algorithm that employs information of the laparoscopic <b>instrument's</b> <b>shaft</b> edges in the image, the instrument's insertion point, and the camera's optical centre to track the 3 D position of the instrument tip. A validation study of EVA comprised {{a comparison of the}} measurements achieved with EVA and the TrEndo tracking system. To this end, 42 participants (16 novices, 22 residents, and 4 experts) were asked to perform a peg transfer task in a box trainer. Ten motion-based metrics were used to assess their performance. RESULTS: Construct validation of the EVA has been obtained for seven motion-based metrics. Concurrent validation revealed that there is a strong correlation between the results obtained by EVA and the TrEndo for metrics such as path length (p= 0, 97), average speed (p= 0, 94) or economy of volume (p= 0, 85), proving the viability of EVA.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background The risk of obtaining a postsurgical infection depends highly {{on the air}} quality surrounding the exposed tissue, surgical instruments, and materials.

40|$|Needle-tract seeding {{refers to}} the {{implantation}} of tumor cells by contamination when instruments, such as biopsy needles, are employed to examine, excise or ablate a tumor. The incidence of this iatrogenic phenomenon is low but it entails serious consequences. Here, as a new method for preventing neoplasm seeding, it is proposed to cause electrochemical reactions at the instrument surface so that a toxic microenvironment is formed. In particular, the <b>instrument</b> <b>shaft</b> would act as the cathode and the tissues would act as the electrolyte in an electrolysis cell. By employing numerical models and experimental observations reported by researchers on Electrochemical Treatment of tumors, it is numerically showed that a sufficiently toxic environment of supraphysiological pH can be created {{in a few seconds}} without excessive heating. Then, by employing an ex vivo model consisting of meat pieces, validity of the conclusions provided by the numerical model concerning pH evolution is confirmed. Furthermore, a simplified in vitro model based on bacteria, instead of tumor cells, is implemented for showing the plausibility of the method. Depending on the geometry of the instrument, suitable current densities will probably range from about 5 mA/cm 2 to 200 mA/cm 2 and the duration of DC current delivery will range from a few seconds to a few minutes.

40|$|Traditional robotic {{surgical}} systems rely {{entirely on}} robotic arms to triangulate articulated instruments inside the human anatomy. This configuration can be ill-suited for working in tight spaces or during single access approaches, where {{little to no}} triangulation between the <b>instrument</b> <b>shafts</b> is possible. The control of these instruments is further obstructed by ergonomic issues: The presence of motion scaling imposes the use of clutching mechanics to avoid the workspace limitations of master devices, and forces the user to choose between slow, precise movements, or fast, less accurate ones. This paper presents a bi-manual system using novel self-triangulating 6 -degrees-of-freedom (DoF) tools through a flexible elbow, which are mounted on robotic arms. The control scheme for the resulting 9 -DoF system is detailed, with particular emphasis placed on retaining maximum dexterity close to joint limits. Furthermore, this paper introduces the concept of gaze-assisted adaptive motion scaling. By combining eye tracking with hand motion and instrument information, the system is capable of inferring the user's destination and modifying the motion scaling accordingly. This safe, novel approach allows the user to quickly reach distant locations while retaining full precision for delicate manoeuvres. The performance and usability of this adaptive motion scaling is evaluated in a user study, showing a clear improvement in task completion speed and in {{the reduction of the}} need for clutching...|$|R
40|$|Long slender {{instruments}} used in Endonasal Surgery {{have two}} main limitations, the first being that current instruments have a fixed shape so that difficult positioned lesions cannot be reached. The other limitation {{is caused by}} the colliding of <b>instrument</b> <b>shafts</b> when multiple shafts are inserted in the surgical corridor, reducing the instrument maneuverability. A Multi-Branched instrument could overcome these problems i. e. an instrument with a single steerable shaft that is inserted through the surgical corridor that at the distal end divides into multiple tool branches that are all steerable. In this research a first step was made to develop a suitable control strategy to operate such an instrument, using a new method for performance testing. Methods: Two interfaces were proposed: A sequential interface that allows the control of a single instrument at a time for each hand, and a simultaneous interface that allows the control of two instruments in parallel for each hand. The simultaneous interface was expected to result in quicker performance. To evaluate their performance, the interfaces were prototyped and connected to a simulation environment containing a virtual Multi-Branched instrument. Results: The sequential interface resulted in around 10 % quicker performance than the simultaneous interface. The used methodology to test the control strategies has proven to be successful and enabled further research with relatively low effort to experiment with other instrument configurations and control concepts.

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting loading cells and/or loading cell construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional loading cells intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting loading cells. Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized loading cells were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines. Then, the use of the new high pressure double-acting loading cells in production testing of <b>instrumented</b> <b>shafts</b> was described, and the efficacy of the new loading cells was illustrated. The new loading cells provided the profession with a load cell alternative for conducting BDLTs and should serve to help reduce the risk of post-test grouting defects in drilled shaft foundations...|$|R

Setting Research laboratory in the Surgical Skills Unit at Ninewells Hospital. Participants Ten surgeons with previous experience in laparoscopic surgery. Main Outcome Measures The execution time (in minutes), leakage pressure (in centimeters of water), and suture error placement score (deviations of the entry and exit points 5 mm from the enterotomy edge or between sutures). Results: The 400 handle-to-shaft angle had a higher mean (SD) leakage pressure of 43. 8 (20. 0) cm H 2 O compared with the 800 and 00 angles (31. 1 [21. 0] and 26. 3 [19. 0] cm H 2 O, respectively) (P<. 001).

Thermal spread was measured in a meat replacement product (quorn) by means of eight thermocouples. Spread of heat was determined as the distance between the <b>instrument</b> <b>shaft</b> and the 7 : 5 _C isotherm.

Materials and methods: A 72 -years old woman with high grade intraepithelial squamous lesion of the cervix and severe dysplasia polyp of the ascending colon was operated on with five trocar oblique arrangements using new platform. The table was moved three times during surgery: the first during hysterectomy placing the patient in 30 ° Trendelenburg position; the second and the third during the right hemicolectomy. The bed was tilted 10 ° to the left for vascular pedicle ligation and right colon mobilization, and then, leaving the bed tilted 10 ° to the left, a reverse Trendelenburg was realized, for right flexure mobilization and for intra-corporeally ileo-colonic anastomosis. We performed two targeting and turned the boom 180 ° from the pelvis to the right upper quadrant. Results: The procedure was successfully completed in 235 min. The pelvis, the lower and upper right quadrants were reached easily only with a re-docking of the platform after hysterectomy. The patients position was changed throughout the intervention with instruments inside the abdomen and no problems were noted. No conversion or additional trocar’ were required.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} on load-settlement behaviour of foundation piles in the volcanic soils of Naples area is presented and discussed. The variability of behaviour among piles {{of the same}} foundation seems independent of the pile technology (bored, driven, auger piles). The behaviour of auger piles is generally intermediate between those of bored and driven piles; {{the results of a}} number of proof load tests, performed on piles belonging to two recent auger pile foundations, confirm this finding. Eventually, the results of load tests carried out up to failure on large diameter bored piles, equipped with a preloading cell at the base and <b>instrumented</b> along the <b>shaft</b> by means of strain gages extensometers, are presented...|$|R
40|$|Even {{with the}} {{establishment}} of Eurocode 7 in the European Union and its accompanying national application documents and standards for geotechnical investigation and testing there are still outstanding problems with the various national practices of pile design. This paper presents a revised interpretation of the prediction exercise for pile bearing capacity and settlement originally presented at ISP 5 in August 2005. The field tests with the Ménard pressuremeter, the static cone penetrometer, and the SPT performed at the site, the answers to the exercise and a detailed investigation of the practice are discussed. The results are compared to the predictions of other national codes and of customarily used design methods and to the results from an <b>instrumented</b> CFA drilled <b>shaft</b> tested on the site...|$|R
