5|$|Spoilt Rotten {{received}} a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> a thought-provoking and convincing {{analysis of a}} newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of cynicism and misanthropic pessimism in his approach, and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes.

McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Italy, Audisio's {{version of}} how Mussolini was {{executed}} {{has largely been}} accepted and is uncontroversial. However, within Italy, the subject has {{been a matter of}} extensive debate and dispute since the late 1940s to the present and a variety of theories of how Mussolini died has proliferated. At least 12 different individuals have been identified at various times as being responsible <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the shooting. Comparisons have been made with the John F.

5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Walmer and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged, and surrendered on 12 July. Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well, leading to the surrender of both remaining fortifications. Walmer was badly damaged during the conflict and it was estimated by Rich, responsible <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the repairs, that the work would cost at least £500.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable.

5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory.

5|$|On {{the basis}} of her work in Malta, Louis C. G. Clarke, the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, invited her to lead {{excavations}} {{on the island of}} Menorca from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the megalithic sites of Trapucó and Sa Torrera, resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca. Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture (1930) and Egyptian Temples (1931), which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in Whomerle Wood near to Stevenage, Hertfordshire; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the excavation remaining unclear.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, Bennett was removed from his post as constable. He was initially replaced by Thomas Rosse and then, in 1661, by Philip Piper. A gaol {{was built in the}} centre of the bailey in the late-17th century; it was bought by the constable and was adopted as the county gaol. In 1690, the county complained to the King that the constable, Sir Hugh Pyper, had allowed it to fall into disrepair and that the male and female prisoners were sleeping together in the same quarters. Two years later, the Crown granted the post of constable in perpetuity to Hugh and for two generations after him; in exchange, Hugh agreed to invest £120 in repairing the facility. The bailey was also used <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> executions.|$|E

5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{the killing}} of Jewish women and {{children}} is concerned, Meyszner's direct involvement is less clear. According to Moll, Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner. Manoschek accepts Schäfer's assertion, stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command, over which Meyszner had very limited control. Despite this, as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates, including the Gestapo department that killed the Jewish women and children. He was also responsible <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> policies that saw 70,000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers, 4,000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway. The Holocaust in Serbia played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946. On 22 December, {{he was sentenced to}} death, along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time. On 24 January 1947, Meyszner was executed by hanging.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2009 the RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting. This shooting occurred outside the Massereene Barracks as four soldiers were receiving a pizza delivery. Two soldiers were killed, and the other two soldiers and two deliverymen were injured. On 3 April 2009 the RIRA in Derry {{claimed responsibility}} <b>for</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> a punishment shooting {{of a man who was}} awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old girl. The RIRA were also blamed for orchestrating rioting in the Ardoyne area of Belfast on 13 July 2009 as an Apprentice Boys parade was passing. Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the Independent Monitoring Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
