5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped <b>feathered</b> serpent deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the <b>feathered</b> serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the <b>feathered</b> serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been {{identified}} as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E

5|$|Archaeopteryx was {{the first}} fossil found that {{revealed}} a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a transitional fossil, in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus. Since the 1990s, a number of additional <b>feathered</b> dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning, northeastern China, {{which was part of}} an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also <b>feathered.</b> The lack of widespread fossil evidence for <b>feathered</b> non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.|$|E

40|$|<b>Feather</b> pecking is {{a problem}} in {{commercial}} laying hens, particularly in loose-housing systems, where many hens can be affected by only a few <b>feather</b> peckers. In addition, <b>feather</b> pecking can become an even larger problem if it spreads throughout the flock. There are several possible ways that <b>feather</b> pecking may spread. The simplest way is that one hen may damage the <b>feathers</b> of a hen, and another hen may find the damaged <b>feathers</b> an attractive pecking target. The aim of this experiment was to determine if damaged <b>feathers</b> were feather-pecked more than undamaged <b>feathers</b> on the same body area, and to determine whether some types of feather-body area manipulations were preferred over others as pecking stimuli. Manipulations involved damaging the <b>feathers</b> on the rump, tail or belly of different hens, with two or three levels of severity of manipulation at each body area. Sixteen groups of 11 Lohmann Brown hens between 26 and 28 weeks were observed with the recipient, the <b>feather</b> pecker and the body area that was pecked all being recorded. The <b>feather</b> pecks were classified separately as either gentle or severe. Damaged <b>feathers</b> received significantly more severe <b>feather</b> pecks than undamaged <b>feathers.</b> There were also more gentle <b>feather</b> pecks to damaged <b>feathers,</b> although this did not reach statistical significance. The feather-body area manipulations that received the greatest number of severe <b>feather</b> pecks were the tail <b>feathers</b> when they were cut very short, the rump <b>feathers</b> when they were trimmed, and the rump when <b>feathers</b> were removed. These results support the suggestion that <b>feather</b> pecking does indeed spread through flocks by damaged <b>feathers</b> becoming an attractive target for feather-pecking behaviour. An unexpected result of performing the <b>feather</b> manipulations was an outbreak of cannibalism in half of the experimental groups. Even though there was no visible damage to the skin of the hens after having the <b>feathers</b> manipulated, 13 of the 16 attacked hens were wounded {{on the part of the}} body where the <b>feathers</b> had been damaged in some way...|$|R

40|$|The moult {{of birds}} could greatly perturb {{the life cycle}} of <b>feather</b> mites (Astigmata). These mites live on the surface of <b>feathers</b> and are {{unlikely}} to survive if they are on one when it is moulted. Therefore, we hypothesized that they would escape to other <b>feathers</b> to avoid this risk of mortality. We analysed the distribution of <b>feather</b> mites on the wings of 63 moulting individuals of 13 species of passerine birds. We used generalized linear mixed models to test whether the distribution of <b>feather</b> mites depends on the stage of moult of <b>feathers.</b> <b>Feather</b> mites were significantly less abundant on the next <b>feather</b> to fall out than on the other <b>feathers.</b> This ability to escape seems to be higher on primaries and secondaries than on tertials. At least on primaries, <b>feather</b> mites avoided not only the next <b>feather</b> to be moulted but also the second one. For primaries and secondaries the new full-grown <b>feathers</b> harboured more <b>feather</b> mites than those still growing.

5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on <b>feather</b> pecking in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on <b>feather</b> pecking in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking, (2) <b>feather</b> pecking and coping strategy, (3) causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, and (4) the possibility to solve the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe <b>feather</b> pecking was studied, it was found that both forms of <b>feather</b> pecking are related at the same age. Gentle <b>feather</b> pecking at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor of <b>feather</b> pecking at adult age. Birds from high and low <b>feather</b> pecking lines that showed differences in <b>feather</b> pecking also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with <b>feather</b> pecking may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. On the causation of <b>feather</b> pecking, there is some evidence that it is redirected ground pecking, deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early <b>feather</b> pecking could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem of <b>feather</b> pecking seems promising. <b>Feather</b> pecking has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in <b>feather</b> pecking have been identified. To search for a solution for the <b>feather</b> pecking problem it is of importance to identify the mechanisms involved in the development of <b>feather</b> pecking. In this paper, we have combined approaches from different disciplines in order to study <b>feather</b> pecking. The results indicate that combined efforts of multidisciplinary research can be very useful in looking for possible ways to reduce <b>feather</b> pecking in practic...|$|R

40|$|The tedious task of {{manually}} placing <b>feathers</b> {{on computer}} animated objects involves aligning <b>feathers,</b> ensuring {{that they do}} not insect each other or penetrate the surface, deforming every <b>feather</b> to match the local surface features, and ensuring that the <b>feather</b> coat is consistent when the underlying object is animated. We present a technique for generating a <b>feather</b> coat over an object. <b>Feather</b> orientation is specified quickly and easily, <b>feathers</b> are deformed while ensuring collision prevention, and the coat can be animated. We create a vector field in the space surrounding the body object and deform <b>feathers</b> to align with the field lines. The non-intersection property of the field lines ensures that <b>feather</b> intersections are avoided. We provide a formulation of a suitable vector field and demonstrate that it is capable of producing realistic <b>feather</b> coats. The process can easily be integrated into the work-flow of standard modelling and animation processes.

5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full <b>feathered</b> coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs.

40|$|Melanins {{are common}} <b>feather</b> {{pigments}} {{that contribute to}} signaling and crypsis. Melanins may also help <b>feathers</b> resist feather-degrading bacteria (FDB). Two recent studies (Goldstein et al. 2004, Grande et al. 2004) tested the resistance of melanized versus unmelanized <b>feathers</b> to FDB using in vitro experiments, but draw opposite conclusions. Goldstein et al. (2004) concluded that melanized <b>feathers</b> resist FDB more than unmelanized <b>feathers,</b> while Grande et al. (2004) concluded that unmelanized <b>feathers</b> resist FDB more than melanized <b>feathers.</b> To resolve this conflict in the literature, we replicated previous studies but included additional tests not previously used. We inoculated melanized and unmelanized <b>feathers</b> of domestic geese Anser anser domesticus, with the FDB Bacillus licheniformis and measured bacterial activity every two days over two weeks. Three metrics of bacterial activity on <b>feathers</b> were measured: soluble protein content around <b>feathers</b> in solution, bacterial growth on <b>feathers,</b> and loss of <b>feather</b> mass. The latter two metrics were not considered in the aforementioned studies, which indirectly measured bacterial activity. We conducted two trials, one in which <b>feathers</b> were sterilized by autoclaving before inoculation (Goldstein et al. 2004, Grande et al. 2004), and a second in which <b>feathers</b> were sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. This allowed us to test whether autoclaving, done in previous studies, influences bacterial activity on <b>feathers</b> and could confound results. In both trials, unmelanized <b>feathers</b> degraded earlier, supported greater bacterial growth, and lost more mass than melanized <b>feathers.</b> These results support the finding...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal behaviours, such as <b>feather</b> pecking, {{can become}} an even greater problem if they spread through the flock. Domestic hens are a social species {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>feather</b> pecking behaviour can be socially transmitted from few <b>feather</b> pecking individuals to many. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether <b>feather</b> pecking is transmitted from an experimental strain of high <b>feather</b> peckers to an experimental strain of low <b>feather</b> peckers when housed together. The effects of environment and age were also investigated. Four hundred and twenty chicks were housed in either cages or pens in one of three treatment groups; all high <b>feather</b> peckers, all low <b>feather</b> peckers, and a mixed group of half high <b>feather</b> peckers and half low <b>feather</b> peckers. During the rearing phase, severe and gentle <b>feather</b> pecks were recorded at 13 – 15 weeks and <b>feather</b> plumage scored at 12 and 17 weeks. At 17 weeks of age, the groups of mixed hens were removed from the study and the remaining hens resorted into the same three treatment groups. During the laying phase, severe and gentle <b>feather</b> pecks were recorded at 30 – 32 weeks of age and <b>feather</b> plumage was scored at 29 weeks of age. There was significantly less <b>feather</b> pecking and plumage damage in the pens than in the cages. There was no evidence of severe <b>feather</b> pecking spreading from <b>feather</b> peckers to non-feather peckers, even when actual rates of <b>feather</b> pecking were examined rather than only considering the strain of hen.
