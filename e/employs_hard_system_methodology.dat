The Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology</b> was developed by Peter Checkland as an alternative to <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> <b>methodologies,</b> such as operational research. The methodology consists of seven stages and uses specific tools; it’s based on a systemic approach, on phenomenology, and hands-on research. It has been applied to the most diverse situations, including problem-situations in organizations. Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology</b> has also been applied in Information Science’ academic research, particularly in England, and now, in Brazil, at University of Brasília, where it was established as a discipline in the Information Science Department’s graduate program. To establish such discipline, the first step taken was the bibliographic survey on Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology,</b> followed by the syllabus development and course organization (taking into account the graduate students, but also including the undergraduate, the ones on PIBIC scholarships). The experience included careful observation of the students’ perceptions and reactions to the subject during the given academic term, as well as observation of the Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology</b> application to real Problem-situations. Besides, effective action was taken to improve graduate and undergraduate students’ interaction – resulting in a more effective interaction in the dept. as a whole. Applied to the Information Science academic studies, Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology</b> contributed to that field of knowledge and to its interdisciplinary connections as well, be it for the methodology’s theoretical content itself, be it for the students’ variety of educational and professional profiles (Engineering, Computer and Information Sciences, Administration).

40|$|Dams {{that store}} water for electricity, irrigation, {{domestic}} water supply or flood control {{have been constructed}} {{for thousands of years}} worldwide. In too many cases, an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid by watershed inhabitants to secure dam benefits, especially in social and environmental terms. The Fincha'a multipurpose dam in western Ethiopia has caused major land use changes, relocated people against their will and induced excessive population pressure in the upper watershed. Following the creation of this dam crop and livestock production have been shifted to steep and fragile parts of the watershed. Lack of agricultural intensification and soil and water conservation (SWC), poor family planning and land tenure insecurity are pressing socio-economic problems leading to impoverishment of the watershed inhabitants. Increased erosion rates and sediment yields reduce the economic life of the dam. Farmers are well aware of erosion problems but they lack confidence in the positive effect on crop yield of recommended SWC measures. The high labour requirement, loss of cropland, land tenure insecurity and the lack of immediate benefits has negatively affected SWC adoption. Integrated watershed management (IWM) has emerged as alternative to the centrally and sectorial approaches in planning dams. The focal point of any dam development programme, using IWM, is the combination of improving the livelihood of the watershed inhabitants and the sustenance of the resource base. For subsistence farmers it is mainly the production in the current season that guarantees the mere survival of their families. Therefore, IWM should be accompanied by c reation of multi-stakeholders platforms and integration of soft and <b>hard</b> <b>system</b> <b>methodologies</b> for creating an environment where science and knowledge help people to develop a diversity of locally appropriate resource management solutions. IWM can effectively address the social, environmental and economic problems during the planning of new dams in Ethiopia...|$|R

40|$|The {{positive}} impact of Computer Aided Design (CAD) in professional architectural practice {{has been in}} focus in recent times but relatively little has been written on its significance {{in the education of}} the contemporary architect. It is common knowledge that the profession of architecture is currently undergoing enormous strains as it battles to keep abreast of trends and developments in a period of series of rapid advancement in science, technology and management (RIBA, 1992). Whilst attempts are being made to redress the shortcomings of the profession in the above context, the requirements for architectural education are yet to forge a coherent strategy for the implementation of CAD/IT in the curriculum of schools of architecture. In almost every other field, including engineering, medicine and the humanities, computing application to problem-solving and decision-making is seen as a way forward as we move into 21 st century. Architectural education must integrate CAD/IT into the teaching of core modules that give the architect distinctive competence: studio design. That {{is one of the best}} ways of doing justice to the education of the architect of today and the future. Some approaches to the teaching of CAD in schools of architecture have been touched upon in the recent past. Building upon this background as well as an understanding of the nature of design teaching/learning, this paper examines ways of maximising the benefits of CAD systems in architectural education and of bringing computer aided designing into the studio not only to enhance design thinking and creativity but also to support interactive processes. In order to maximise or optimise any function, one approach is to use the <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> <b>methodology</b> which utilises analytic, analogic and iconic models to show the effect of those factors which are significant for the purposes being considered. The other approach is to use the soft <b>systems</b> <b>methodology</b> in which the analysis encompasses the concept of a human activity system as a means of improving a situation. The use of soft <b>systems</b> <b>methodology</b> is considered more appropriate for dealing with the problem of design which is characterised by a flux of interacting events and ideas that unroll through time. The paper concludes that the main impediment to maximising the benefits of CAD systems in architectural education is not only the inappropriate definition of the objectives for the implementation of CAD education but also that the control subsystems are usually ill-structured and relatively poorly defined. Schools must attempt to define a coherent and consistent policy on the use of CAD systems as an integral part of studio design and evolve an in-house strategic and operational controls that enable the set objectives to be met. Furthermore, it is necessary to support the high level of productivity from CAD systems with a more efficient management system, especially in dealing with communication, data sharing via relational database, co-ordination and integration. Finally, the use of soft <b>systems</b> <b>methodology</b> is recommended as the way forward to optimising CAD systems in design education as it would provide continuous improvements while maintaining their productive value...|$|R
40|$|Checkland's "soft systems" {{methodology}} {{was developed}} for analysing institutional problem situations and the extension of its use to geography {{has been the focus}} of some debate in the geographical literature. Some geographers have argued that the methodology is not fundamentally different from the traditional <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> <b>methodologies</b> or, alternatively, that it cannot be applied to the type of problem situations (i. e. regional, open-ended) which are the main focus of geographers' concern. Others disagree and suggest that these views reflect fundamental misunderstandings of the philosophy which underpins the methodology. This debate has taken place within an overall framework of concern over the perceived failure of the systems approach to make the expected progress within geography over the last twenty years. Some have ascribed this failure to the inadequacies of systems' methodologies. [...] This thesis explores the potential of Checkland's methodology for use by geographers. It examines the methodology's philosophical base and applies the methodology to a problem situation within the domain of fisheries geography. The situation selected is the North Labrador fishery and the role played by the native peoples' co-operative in its current development. The research consequently develops two main threads: the philosophic, and the applied. [...] The philosophic analysis suggests that the methodology would be more soundly based on Husserlian phenomenology than on the mixture of positivist and existentialist philosophies Checkland espouses. The application of the methodology results in a richer expression of the North Labrador fishery than would have been expected from a more traditional approach. A number of conceptual models are generated for both the North Labrador fishery and the Torngat Co-operative, and the capacity of the methodology to produce results that relate well to current theoretical approaches such as modes of production is demonstrated. The implications of the overall analysis of the models are that the North Labrador fishery should be seen as part of a pluralistic economic system and that the role of Torngat is one of operationalising the drive for greater independence by North Labradorians. [...] The overall conclusion is that the methodology has the capacity for use in geographical research, but requires additional development before it can be expected to readily attract geographers. It is suggested, however, that geographers should play a role in such developments, particularly through extending the number of applications the methodology receives in supra-institutional research.

The soft <b>systems</b> <b>methodology</b> is described as a never ending learning system that starts by expressing the situation where the perceived problem lies while not distorting the problem into a preconceived or standard form. <b>Hard</b> <b>systems</b> thinking (e.g. systems engineering and systems analysis) assumes that problems can be formulated as the making of a choice between alternative means achieving a known end (Checkland 1985; Beard 2012).|$|R

40|$|The quality, {{timeliness}} {{and availability}} of appropriate information to appropriate decision makers determine the quality of decisions; it therefore also determines the subsequent effect of these decisions on organisations. Organisations that make better decisions quicker than their rivals are more agile and competitive. Well-informed decisions improve organisations’ economic results and value; it improves planning processes and enables organisations to swiftly react to ever-changing business climates. Business intelligence (BI) systems enable organisational leaders to make decisions more effectively and efficiently; BI is a business differentiator {{in a world where}} organisations are becoming increasingly reliant on relevant, timeous, and intelligible information to improve their operational efficiency. Traditional development approaches, for example the Kimball lifecycle approach or Inmon’s corporate information factory, are used to develop BI systems. These traditional approaches are heavily influenced by the paradigm within which traditional software development approaches emerged, i. e. the <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> thinking paradigm. The <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> thinking paradigm is dominated by deterministic problem solving methodologies such as operational research and systems engineering; they focus on optimisation and design and are suitable for well-defined problem contexts. Traditional approaches enable the development of technically good and robust technological architecture and infrastructure (such as the data warehouse). However, BI systems are social artefacts as well as technical artefacts; they should aim to improve the organisational context of users, rather than merely automate existing business processes. Successful BI requires more than an appropriate data warehouse; it requires more than a data infrastructure and platform built to access existing/known information better and faster. Successful BI system development requires a critical reflective process that improves organisational decision making capabilities beyond what is imaginable, rather than merely automate what is easily observable. The critical systems thinking (CST) paradigm aims to explore relevant social dimensions of a problem context and provide richer, more meaningful solutions. CST aims to facilitate social improvement. CST is founded in critical and social awareness; methodological complementarism; and a dedication to human emancipation. Critical systems thinkers aim to emancipate the oppressed by exploring and removing supressing societal structures. This study views business users with unrealised business benefits as the oppressed; non-people oriented (traditional) BI system development approaches are viewed as the suppressing structures. The CST paradigm does not render other paradigms, such as the <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> thinking paradigm where BI development approaches emerged, invalid. Rather, within the CST paradigm the epistemological debate moved from the question of selection a single problem solving method, to recognising the value of combining different methods from different paradigms. This study explores the application of critical <b>systems</b> <b>methodologies</b> (such as critical systems heuristics) from the CST paradigm to complement a traditional BI system development approach. The researcher follows an action research approach to develop guidelines for the use of critical <b>systems</b> <b>methodologies</b> in BI <b>system</b> development.

The straightforward transfer of SE to the broader situations of management was not possible, but by insisting on a combination of systems thinking strongly linked to real-world practice Checkland and his collaborators developed an alternative approach - Soft <b>Systems</b> <b>Methodology</b> (SSM) - which enables managers of all kinds and at any level to deal with the subtleties and confusions of the situations they face. This work established the now accepted distinction between <b>hard</b> <b>systems</b> thinking, in which parts of the world are taken to be systems which can be engineered, and soft systems thinking in which the focus is on making sure the process of inquiry into real-world complexity is itself a system for learning.
