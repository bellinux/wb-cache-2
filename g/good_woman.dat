The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot more because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a <b>good</b> <b>woman</b> to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E

25|$|Lizzie Hexam also {{objects to}} her {{marriage}} to Eugene Wrayburn. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time. Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such a <b>good</b> <b>woman.</b> He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status. Therefore, both of them end up going against expectations by marrying each other.|$|E

In contrast to their father, the Deemster's children, Ewan and Mona, grow up to become a conscientious and diligent priest and a caring and <b>good</b> <b>woman.</b> In contrast, without the strong hand to admonish him, the Bishop's son, Dan, grows up to become “thoughtless, brave, stubborn,” likeable but unreliable. The cousins, Mona and Dan, come to fall in love.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in 1846 Beverly {{had been}} engaged by John Medex Maddox as {{principal}} artist at the Princess's Theatre, London. In July the scenery for {{the revival of}} James Robinson Planché's Sleeping Beauty was from his brush, as were the backgrounds in the Christmas pantomime The Enchanted Beauties of the Golden Castle. In Easter 1847 he provided ingenious transformations for a revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream. While still continuing his association with the Princess's, Beverly worked for the Lyceum Theatre under Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Charles James Mathews (1847–55), where Planché compared him with the stage mechanician William Bradwell. His outstanding success was in The Island of Jewels of December 1849, when building {{on the work of}} Bradwell, he pioneered the transformation scene. His scenery at the Lyceum for Planché's <b>Good</b> <b>Woman</b> in a Wood (Christmas 1852), and for Once upon a time there were two Kings (Christmas 1853), was praised by G. H. Lewes and Henry Morley.|$|E

25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (<b>Good</b> <b>woman</b> in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E

He said later that [...] "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." [...] Another time, Pollard remarked that [...] "Someone once said that a man deserves one <b>good</b> <b>woman</b> and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse.

500|$|Thompson is {{particularly}} known for playing reticent women, and Sands describes her as [...] "the best actress {{of our times}} on suffering borne with poignant dignity". According to Kate Kellaway of The Guardian, she specialises in playing [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>woman</b> in a frock". She also plays many haughty characters, with a [...] "bracing, nanny-like demeanour", but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences. Thompson belongs {{to a group of}} highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in [...] "heritage films" [...] and typically showing [...] "restraint, rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings, and a sense of irony, which demonstrates the heroine's superior understanding". Projecting a typically [...] "British image", Thompson's often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to Maggie Smith.|$|E

Janine Chapman, an esotericist who researched Fortune's life, stated that [...] "in her prime", Fortune was [...] "a strong, magnetic personality" [...] with [...] "an active, intellectually curious mind" [...] {{who was also}} [...] "physically imposing". Chapman noted that while studying at horticultural college, Fortune had earned a reputation for having a [...] "keen sense of humor", being particularly fond of practical jokes. Richardson characterised Fortune as being [...] "honest, and other ruthless with her honesty", adding that she was [...] "an essentially <b>good</b> <b>woman</b> who had strands of darkness within". Chapman noted that she [...] "set an example of super-achievement, self-sacrifice, and personal integrity" [...] and that [...] "sexually, she was modest, faithful, and chaste". In her later years, she earned a nickname among her friends in the Fraternity; [...] "The Fluff".|$|E
500|$|... "Once the {{manuscript}} was complete, he [...] sat opposite Richards {{and read the}} entire book aloud to him ... He {{turned out to be}} a really natural editor. He cut according to the sound of it." [...] Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it [...] "covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman." [...] Time's Richard Corliss writes [...] "Confessional autobiographies, unless they're by William Boroughs, tend to have inspirational endings: salvation through strong will or a <b>good</b> <b>woman.</b> Life has both." ...|$|E
500|$|The central {{action of}} Love's Last Shift {{is a celebration}} of the power of a <b>good</b> <b>woman,</b> Amanda, to reform a rakish husband, Loveless, by means of sweet {{patience}} and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless' penitence and Amanda's [...] "submissive eloquence". The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time the talk of the town, in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.|$|E

During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems...
