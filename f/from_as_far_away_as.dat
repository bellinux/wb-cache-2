It can also be seen from the Terminal 1 restaurant area and departure lounges of Manchester Airport.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the Ma and Pa {{acquired}} four {{diesel locomotives}} for more economical operations, but traffic declined significantly. When the Ma and Pa's mail contract was cancelled by the U.S. postal service, the railroad discontinued all passenger service on August 31, 1954. One person on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., {{to participate in the}} historic event, along with members of the National Railway Historical Society. The picturesque line's last steam engine dropped its fire for the final time on November 29, 1956.|$|E
50|$|Šiluva {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1457 {{in relation to}} the building of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Bartholomew by the Lithuanian noble Petras Gedgaudas. Later the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary attracted huge numbers of the faithful to Šiluva, some <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> of what later became Protestant Prussia.|$|R
50|$|Concerned {{members of}} the public {{organised}} their own search parties, at times consisting of more than 1,600 individuals, some <b>from</b> areas <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> London, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area were the indigenous people belonging to the Wakka Wakka (or Waka Waka) people. The area {{was used as a}} gateway to the bunya nut festivals, where Aboriginal people would travel <b>from</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> the Clarence River in northern New South Wales and the Maranoa River to feast on bunya nuts from the bunya trees.|$|R
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power. Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Register, {{based in}} Harrisburg, has been {{providing}} coverage of news for southeastern Illinois since 1869, and {{is owned by}} GateHouse Media. It is the major daily newspaper serving Harrisburg, Saline County, and distributes to Paducah, Kentucky, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Mount Vernon, Illinois. The second major newspaper is The Eldorado Daily Journal, based in Eldorado and operated by GateHouse as a sister newspaper to the Register. Newspapers are also delivered into the city <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Evansville, Chicago, and St. Louis. It is often included in the Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky Tri-State Area.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E

50|$|Saint Aloysius' College {{began in}} Sevenhill in 1856, {{as part of}} the Jesuit missioning to the colony of South Australia. The college took on boarders, as a boys only college, <b>from</b> places <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses {{in the style}} of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|Sandgate was {{intended}} to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland. Sandgate's construction was supervised by the Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg, and Thomas Cockys and Richard Keys acted as commissioners for the project. In {{the initial stages of}} the work in 1539, a team of 237 men were employed, with masons, quarrymen, limeburners and wood fellers preparing the site; the masons were drawn <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Somerset and Gloucestershire. By the summer, over 500 were at work, including labourers, bricklayers, carpenters and sawyers. After a pause during the winter months, work picked up again in the summer of the next year, with 630 working on the castle that July.|$|E

500|$|Birmingham's {{development}} as a commercial town was originally based around its market for agricultural produce, established by royal charter in 1166. Despite the industrialisation of subsequent centuries this role has been retained and the Birmingham Wholesale Markets remain the largest combined wholesale food markets in the country, selling meat, fish, fruit, vegetables and flowers and supplying fresh produce to restaurateurs and independent retailers <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> [...] <b>away.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches {{on one side of the}} courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} {{the upper part of}} the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is {{composed}} of granite formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya). The bedrock of the river as it flows through Tollymore is shale from the Silurian age, more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of basalt are found were molten basalt lava was forced through cracks in the bedrock about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Antrim, Tyrone and Scotland, which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|The keep was {{surrounded}} by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E
50|$|Giri Kedaton had {{religious}} school that {{was founded by}} Sunan Giri, one of the Wali Sanga. The school grew and became famous as a center of Muslim teaching, which gave it political influence in the surrounding region.

5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe {{called one of the}} worst floods {{in the history of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration fell back on the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers. The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Aberdeen, had cost £50,000 in 1655, when it was still unfinished.

5|$|Hersing {{attacked}} {{a convoy of}} fifteen merchant ships escorted by fourteen destroyers in August south-west of Ireland. He took U-21 {{between two of the}} escorting destroyers and briefly used his periscope to gauge the speed and course of the transports before firing two torpedoes and diving. Hersing reported both torpedoes hit and the destroyers immediately rushed to begin their depth charge attacks. After a five-hour hunt, the destroyers withdrew to rejoin the convoy. The experience led Hersing to change tactics in future attacks on escorted convoys; instead of attacking the ships <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> possible, he chose to fire his torpedoes at closer range and then dive under the transport ships, where the destroyers would be unable to launch their depth charges for fear of damaging the transports. As of 1918, she was assigned to the III U-boat Flotilla. Later in 1918, the submarine was used as a training boat for new crews. She survived the war, but on 22 February 1919, she accidentally sank in the North Sea while under tow to Britain, where she would be formally surrendered.|$|E

5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|Poulton {{became an}} {{important}} centre for trade in the area. With harbours {{on either side of}} the River Wyre, at Skippool and Wardleys, it was able to import goods <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Russia and North America. Flax was imported from Ireland and the Baltic, timber came from across the Atlantic and tallow from Russia. Records from 1806–08 show that Poulton imported limestone from Ulverston, oats from Ulverston, Kirkcudbright, Dumfries, Wigtown, Whitehaven and Liverpool, and coal from Preston. Cheese was exported to the same places. By the 18thcentury, markets for cattle and cloth were being held in the town in February, April and November, with corn fairs every Monday. It is unclear at what point Poulton began life as a market town; it was never granted a market charter and so markets were held by prescription. The market cross probably dates from the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>as</b> Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E

50|$|Marlow {{because of}} its {{accessibility}} to the M4 and M40 motorways soon became popular as a training venue for International training sides <b>from</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> places <b>as</b> Argentina to Russia during this period. Marlow's population was still growing and the outskirts of Greater Marlow spread to embrace Marlow Bottom during this time. Players from first class clubs in London, were attracted to this beautiful Thames side setting and naturally Riverwoods was their first port of call. 1980 Being Champions of 6 Counties saw Marlow drawn against Bath (included 3 current Internationals) to become the 1st Junior club to reach the last 32 in the John Player Cup on 3 occasions (Played Rosslyn Park 1972 and 1975) The team acquitted themselves so well on the day, that Jack Rowell (later to become England Manager) brought the Bath team to play a pre season warm up game at Marlow under lights.|$|R
