50|$|A snap gun, {{also known}} as lock pick gun, <b>pick</b> gun, or <b>electric</b> lock <b>pick,</b> is a tool {{that can be used}} to force open a {{mechanical}} pin tumbler lock (a common type of cylinder lock) without using the key. A steel rod is inserted into the lock and the snap gun briefly fires the rod against all of the lock pins simultaneously, momentarily freeing the cylinder and enabling it to be turned using a tension wrench. The snap gun is an alternative to a conventional lockpick, which requires other techniques such as raking to free the pins.|$|R

5000|$|Musically, [...] "Chestnut Mare" [...] {{echoes the}} sound of The Byrds' mid-1960s recordings, with McGuinn's chiming 12-string Rickenbacker guitar sitting {{alongside}} guitarist Clarence White's country-style acoustic and <b>electric</b> guitar <b>picking.</b> Lyrically, the song's spoken verses recount {{the story of one}} man's quest to tame a wild horse and echo the familiar Byrds' themes of nature and freedom. The song's narrative can also be seen to deal in mythic archetypes; the wild mare being an embodiment of untamed nature, which the narrator wants to control, and as such, an analogy of mankind's attempts to dominate and subjugate the natural environment.|$|R
5000|$|... "New Dawn Fades" [...] is a {{song from}} the 1979 album Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division. It opens with a {{backwards}} and heavily modified sample from previous song [...] "Insight", presumably added by Martin Hannett, post-production. The song relies on an ascending guitar riff by Bernard Sumner played against a descending bass riff by Peter Hook. The song uses the same progression throughout, but grows in intensity as the song progresses, reaching its peak with Ian Curtis singing [...] "Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else", and ending with a guitar solo. The song closes side one of Unknown Pleasures. It's also one of few Joy Division songs with two distinct guitars playing, one distorted and one a clean <b>electric</b> guitar <b>picking</b> notes from the guitar chords.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examine the}} short and long terms causal {{relationship}} between electricity consumption and real GDP in China through vector error correction model, which can avoid the false causal relationship. The results of the VECM reveal the co-integration relationship between real GDP and electricity consumption {{and the presence of}} unidirectional causality from electricity consumption to economic growth in the short-run and long-run, which is subsequently verified in two different sub-phases. And then we come up with some suggestions that China should modulate the supply structure of <b>electric</b> power and <b>pick</b> up speed to adjust industry structures...|$|R
25|$|On 21 December 2009, Tornado rescued about 100 {{people who}} were {{stranded}} by bad weather at London Victoria station. On that day, a number of <b>electric</b> trains, which <b>picked</b> up their power from the third rail, were unable to run because of snow and ice on the line. Tornado was to haul a Cathedrals Express lunchtime special service from Victoria; a number of booked passengers {{had been unable to}} get there due to the conditions, and so there were spare seats; the train's operators decided to offer these seats to commuters whose trains had been cancelled. Tornado also had an evening Cathedrals Express dining train, and the same offer was again made.|$|R
5000|$|Symphonic {{black metal}} is {{a style of}} black metal that {{incorporates}} symphonic and orchestral elements. This may include the usage of music workstation keyboards to conjure up [...] "pseudo-orchestral" [...] landscapes with default presets (e.g. strings, choirs, piano, organs, and pads), or full orchestral arrangements containing woodwind, brass, percussion, keyboards and strings.

40|$|A charged {{free carrier}} in an applied <b>electric</b> field may <b>pick</b> up enough {{energy from the}} field {{to allow it to}} impact ionize an excition. For this to occur, the carrier must have an energy greater than the exciton binding energy. At low {{temperatures}} (T<~ 10 °K in Ge and T<~ 30 °K in Si) and modest electric fields (E∼ 2 V/cm in pure Ge and E∼ 20 V/cm in pure Si), the energy of a significant number of carriers exceed this threshold energy. Once this happens, the impact-ionization process can change the relative concentration of excitons and free carriers; the equilibrium law of mass action is no longer satisfied. Calculations of exciton concentration (for fixed carrier concentration) as a function of temperature and applied-field strength show that a sudden drop in exciton concentration occurs when electric fields exceed a temperature-dependent critical field...|$|R
50|$|Although first {{starting}} {{out as a}} bass player but later switching to guitar, performing with various cover bands before concentrating on this own music, Mattsson was first discovered by Mike Varney (Guitar Player Magazine and Shrapnel Records) in 1985. After playing and touring with various local hard rock bands, Mattsson recorded and released the 4-track vinyl EP Can’t Go On Without Your Love in 1987. Soon after this Mattsson signed to Black Dragon Records, a French indie label for which he recorded 3 albums: Eternity (1988), No Surrender (1989) and the all-instrumental Electric Voodoo (1991). Eternity and No Surrender were released in Japan by FEMS, while the instrumental <b>Electric</b> Voodoo was <b>picked</b> up by Leviathan Records in the US and released under the Title The Exciter in 1992, and then in 1995 it was released in Asia by SKC.|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s, Swedish {{aircraft}} manufacturer Saab AB became increasingly {{interested in the}} civil aircraft market. In 1974, the company decided to proceed with developing its first major civilian aircraft, having previously focused almost entirely upon military aircraft. During the late 1970s, internal studies had determined that a short-haul airliner should be optimised to seat around 30 passengers. Likewise, {{it was decided that}} to make use of turboprop propulsion, which was slower but more economical than turbofan engines, and to optimise the airliner {{to take advantage of this}} type of powerplant; this decision may have been influenced by high oil prices during that decade, such as the 1973 oil crisis. According to author Gunnar Elisson, the selection of a turboprop engine made the type less attractive to airlines than jet-powered competitors, however recognised that the General <b>Electric</b> CT7-5A2 engine <b>picked</b> was quite competitive with the jet engines of that era. As conceived, the airliner was to match the performance of jets within its short-haul role.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of the voltage and current dynamics in a resonant Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) circuit {{in the view of}} their control. The high-frequency operation of the circuit calls for the selection of appropriate quantities to be considered and for the development of specific methods to be used for describing their dynamics. In the paper, three methods developed for this purpose are presented and discussed. They are the Generalized State-Space Averaging (GSSA), Laplace Phasor Transform (LPT) and Modulated Variable Laplace Transform (MVLT) methods, where the latter one is here proposed. Afterwards, the receiving circuit of a series-resonant WPT charger of an <b>electric</b> vehicle is <b>picked</b> up as a study case, and the model of its dynamics is worked out by the three methods. At last, the accuracy of the resulting models is evaluated by checking their step response against that of the study case as obtained by simulation...|$|R
40|$|Wave normal {{directions}} of auroral hiss observed by the S- 310 JA- 5 rocket are analyzed from the spin modulation data of <b>electric</b> field components <b>picked</b> up by a dipole antenna extended {{perpendicular to the}} rocket axis, and the angle between the wave normal direction and the rocket axis observed by the crossed loop antennas which are both perpendicular to the rocket axis. It is found that the wave normals were making large angles to the magnetic meridian plane, so that the ray paths tracing back to the source indicate an altitude which is not above 700 km, when the electron and ion temperature are less than 800 K. The electron density between 200 km and 230 km actually observed by same rocket showed a density gradient much less than that represented by the plasma temperature of 800 K. This point will support our result for the source altitude of auroral hiss observed by rocket...|$|R
