His roles in comedy and {{dramatic}} films garnered Williams an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (for {{his role as}} a psychologist in Good Will Hunting (1997)), as well as two previous Academy Award nominations (for playing an English teacher in Dead Poets Society (1989), and for playing a troubled homeless man in The Fisher King (1991)). In 1991, he played an adult Peter Pan in the movie Hook, although he had said that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> twenty-five pounds.|$|E

R. R. Tolkien. He reprised his roles as Smaug and the Necromancer for [...] (2013) and [...] (2014). For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that looks {{a little bit like a}} mundane government building. It was just me as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E

500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E

[...] He walks across the room. Add ill-fitting clothes, mop-top hair, a pair of {{oversize}} glasses and a cold stare, and the impersonation is complete.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Lowe {{was cast}} in his best remembered role, as Captain Mainwaring in the BBC sitcom Dad's Army (1968–1977). His colleagues on the show later remarked that the role resembled Lowe, pompous and bumbling; Lowe had a clause written into his contract, specifying {{that he would never}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his trousers. He also played Mainwaring's drunken brother Barry Mainwaring, in the 1975 Christmas episode [...] "My Brother and I". Lowe and his {{character}} also surfaced in a radio version of Dad's Army, a stage play and a feature-length film released in 1971. While Dad's Army was not in production, Lowe appeared in plays at the National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. In 1968 Lowe was invited by Laurence Olivier to act at the National Theatre at the Old Vic and appeared in Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty in 1968 and later The Tempest in 1974 with John Gielgud.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years she {{revealed}} a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. [...] "As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw … dirty, worthless actions." [...] "Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Thérèse used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own." [...] Her sister Céline's memoir is filled with numerous examples of the teacher Thérèse. [...] "Céline: - 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Thérèse: - 'Rather, how much you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose!</b> Jesus Himself will fill your soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way." [...] And Céline recalled a story Thérèse told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Thérèse visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for Céline too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, I no longer have any sugar ring for poor Céline!' Reminding me of the incident she observed; 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it Céline's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?' Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. [...] "Thérèse deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went {{out of her way to}} spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head." ...|$|E

The game was too powerful to be hunted down by Mr Squercum's unassisted hands. He had already seen Mr Bumby on the matter more than once. Mr Bumby was inclined to doubt whether it might not be better to get the money, or some guarantee for the money. Mr Bumby thought that if a bill at three months could be had for Dolly's share of the property it might be expedient to take it. Mr Squercum suggested that the property itself might be recovered, no genuine sale having been made. Mr Bumby shook his head. 'Title-deeds give possession, Mr Squercum. You don't suppose that the company which has lent money to Melmotte on the title-deeds would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> it.
