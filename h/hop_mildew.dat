In Washington, severe infections lead to a yield loss of 800 hectares (US $10 million) of crops. At the time, sulfur was the only registered pesticide used on hop that was effective against powdery mildew. In 1998, the disease was confirmed in Idaho and Oregon. As a result, Yakima Valley growers managed the disease using approaches developed in Europe, such as, labor-intensive cultural practices, mechanical removal of spring growth, and intensive fungicide programs despite the small number of fungicides available for hop at the time. Although the methods successfully limited disease development, the depressed market for hops couldn't sustain the expensive production costs ($1400/ha annually in 1998). In 2001, a contracting brewery rejected 50% of an aroma hop grown in Oregon because of cone browning after drying, resulting in an additional US $5 million in losses that year. These losses have contributed to economic depression in the hop market and have forced several growers to declare bankruptcy. Currently, <b>hop</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> exists annually in all production regions in the United States. While more research is necessary to understand Podosphaera macualaris and control, the current management system has returned economics to hop industry. Disease levels have decreased and control costs have been reduced to $740/ha on average. Unlike New York and California, hop production in the Pacific Northwest is likely to continue.|$|R

If left unmanaged, <b>hop</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> can cause total crop loss due to disease or browning of hop cones rendering the cones unmarketable to buyers. The <b>Hop</b> Powdery <b>Mildew</b> Infection Risk Index (HOPS) is heavily relied on for management of the disease. However, HOPS assumes constant inoculum presence, which is not likely to be true. Evidence suggests that temperature fluctuations influence inoculum availability. As such, knowledge of inoculum presence and density and their relationship to environmental conditions may increase management efficacy by reducing pesticide use and cost of crop production. Molecular methods for detecting and quantifying P. macularis were developed and used to analyze air samples taken from hop fields for two seasons. A protocol for DNA extraction from field samples was modified in order to use PCR to detect and quantify P. macularis DNA from the field. Primers and a probe designed to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of P. macularis ribosomal DNA have made inoculum detection possible using both conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). DNA extracted from conidia impinged on glass rods coated in silicon grease has been used as template for qPCR, and we have successfully detected as DNA extracted from 10 spores Specific and sensitive detection of P. macularis DNA with conventional PCR was possible under conditions typically used to evaluate qPCR; however results from field samples indicated that sensitivity was an issue, in that spores were not detected in samples from fields with high disease pressure. The effects of constant exposure (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C) and 6 hr exposure (18, 22, 26, 30, 34, and 38 °C) on sporulation of P. macularis were tested. Exposure to constant low and high temperatures decreases sporulation, which indicates that inoculum may not always be available once the epidemic has started. Sporulation is also decreased during brief exposures to temperatures above 30 °C. These data indicate that inoculum availability is reduced when the temperature exceeds 30 °C in the field. A modification of HOPS should be examined to incorporate an algorithm which takes the findings in this study into account...|$|R

We investigated temperature measurement errors introduced when sampling interval was increased from 15 to 60 min, and when actual in-canopy conditions were represented by temperature measurements collected by standard-placement sensors (1. 5 m above the ground, outside the canopy) in each of three crops (grass seed, grape, and hops) and assessed the impact of these errors on outcomes of decision aids for grass stem rust as well as grape and <b>hops</b> powdery <b>mildews.</b> Decreasing time resolution from 15 to 60 min resulted in statistically significant underestimates of daily maximum temperatures and overestimates of daily minimum temperatures that averaged 0. 2 to 0. 4 degrees C. Sensor location (in-canopy versus standard-placement) also had a statistically significant effect on measured temperature, and this effect was significantly less in grape or hops than in the grass seed crop. Effects of these temperature errors on performance of disease management decision aids were affected by magnitude of the errors as well as the type of decision aid. The grape and <b>hops</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> decision aids used rule-based indices, and the relatively small (+/- 0. 8 degrees C) differences in temperature observed between in-canopy and standard placement sensors in these crops resulted in differences in rule outcomes when actual in-canopy temperatures were near a threshold for declaring that a rule had been met. However, there were only minor differences in the management decision (i. e., fungicide application interval). The decision aid for grass stem rust was a simulation model, for which temperature recording errors associated with location of the weather station resulted in incremental (not threshold) effects on the model of pathogen growth and plant infection probability. Simple algorithms were devised to correct the recorded temperatures or the computed infection probability to produce outcomes similar to those resulting from in-canopy temperature measurements. This study illustrates an example of evaluating (and, if necessary, correcting) temperature measurement errors from weather station sensors not located within the crop canopy, and provides an estimate of uncertainty in temperature measurements associated with location and sampling interval of weather station sensors...|$|R

5000|$|The {{two primary}} ways to control Podosphaera macularis are {{cultural}} and chemical control. The {{most effective way}} to manage <b>hop</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> is through preventative measures. Cultural control of the disease include growing powdery-mildew tolerant/resistant varieties of the host plant. Cultural practices that can help prevent the disease include carefully monitoring water and nutrient, reducing initial inoculum, and removing basal growth. Furthermore, pruning, crowning, and/or scratching will aid in further reduction of the disease. Pruning consists of removing shoots before training. Crowning refers to the process of removing the top 1-2 inches of the crown before budbreak. Scratching is done through disturbing the soil surface to remove the top 1-2 inches of buds. All of these methods disturb the overwintering stage of the life cycle of Podosphaera macularis. Likewise, chemical control primarily consists of spraying fungicides in hopes of preventing the disease through the use of early, continuous spraying during the growing season. Thus, prophylactic fungicide programs can be a very effective way in preventing the disease. Since the fungicides are a preventative measure, they are not very useful to use during a full-blown infection. Therefore, the use of fungicides disturbs release of spores and further infection within the disease cycle of Podosphaera macularis. As there are several fungicides that are effective against powdery mildew, it is important to apply the fungicides at specific times. If it is known that powdery mildew is present, spray programs should be started as soon as the shoots emerge. Due to powdery mildew's ability to quickly develop resistance to fungicides, it is important to rotate the fungicides that are used. However, few or no fungicide applications should be used during burr development as these burrs have increased vulnerability to damage. In this case, removing basal growth before flowering and applying a protectant fungicide with long-term residual action should be employed.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{two most}} {{economically}} important plant pathogens in the Pseudoperonospora (Peronosporaceae) genus are P. cubensis, causal agent of cucurbit downy mildew, and P. humuli, causal agent of <b>hop</b> downy <b>mildew.</b> These organisms {{have been shown to}} be very closely related phylogenetically and morphologically. In 2005, researchers in Korea proposed that based on morphological similarities and internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS nrDNA) sequence data, P. humuli should be reduced taxonomically to a synonym of P. cubensis. As this taxonomic change has implications for identification, management, and regulation, the current study further explores this issue using multigenic analyses and host specificity experiments. Multigenic sequence analyses were conducted considering five loci for 21 isolates of P. cubensis and 14 isolates of P. humuli. The five loci used in the analysis were the ITS, β-tubulin gene, cytochrome c oxidase II gene (cox 2), cytochrome c oxidase I gene (cox 1), and the spacer between cox 2 and cox 1. Additionally, the cytochrome c oxidase genes and spacer were combined for analysis as the cox cluster, and all five loci were concatenated for a robust analysis using Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference. Although the topology and statistical support for the topology for each locus differed, there was a consistent separation of a majority of the P. humuli isolates and the P. cubensis isolates.

50|$|Podosphaera macularis overwinters on {{the soil}} surface in debris as fungal {{survival}} structures (chasmothecia) or as mycelia in plant buds. These chasmothecia are formed closer {{to the end of}} the growing season. The characteristic morphology of chasmothecia of <b>Hop</b> Powdery <b>Mildew</b> are spherical black structures with spiked appendages. When favorable conditions are encountered during early spring, the asci (sac-like structures) within chasmothecia will rupture and ascospores will be discharged. Specifically, the favorable conditions for ascospore release include low light, excess fertility, and high soil moisture. Additionally, optimal infection is observed when the temperature is between 18 and 25 °C. Furthermore, the ascospores act as the primary inoculum and are dispersed passively by wind. Upon encountering a susceptible host plant, the ascospores will germinate and cause infection. Following infection, masses of asexual spores (conidia) will be produced during the season. It is these masses of conidia that contribute to the characteristic white, powdery appearance of infected plants. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the disease can appear on any part of the plant that is above the ground. These conidia are dispersed through wind. Thus, Podosphaera macularis is a polycyclic pathogen as conidia are produced/dispersed during the growing season and can further infect additional host plants. Particularly, the disease will be noticeable on infected plants as soon as the hop shoots start to emerge with the latent period being approximately 10 days at 12 and 15°C compared to 5 days at 18-27°C. These spore-covered shoots that emerge from infected buds are called “flag shoots” and will be stunted with distorted leaves. Periods of rapid plant growth are the most favorable for infection. In addition, the period in which lateral branch development takes place within the plants is also very vulnerable to the development of the disease. Due to Podosphaera macularis causing local infection, only the location of the host plant tissue where spores have landed will develop the disease.|$|R

Percent disease control on cones was influenced by midseason foliar disease and fungicide mode-of-action. FRAC 13 provided significantly better disease control on cones than all other groups except U 13, 3, and premixes of 7 with 11. Disease control on leaves was similar when a rotational program of fungicides was used, independent of the modes of action, but improved on cones if FRAC groups 13 and 3 were both included compared with programs consisting of FRAC groups 11 and 3, 11 and 5, or 3 and 5.

In greenhouse experiments, control of downy mildew on leaves was similar among fungicides tested when applied preventatively but varied depending on both the fungicide and the timing of application postinfection. Disease control decreased as applications of copper were made later after inoculation. In contrast, cymoxanil, trifloxystrobin, and dimethomorph reduced disease with similar efficacy when applied 48 h after inoculation compared with preventative applications of these fungicides. When fungicides were applied 72 h after inoculation, only dimethomorph reduced the sporulating leaf area similarly to preinoculation application timing. Adaxial chlorosis, necrosis, and water soaking of inoculated leaves, indicative of infection by P. humuli, were more severe when plants were treated with cymoxanil, trifloxystrobin, and dimethomorph 48 to 72 h after inoculation, even though sporulation was suppressed. Trifloxystrobin and dimethomorph applied 72 h after inoculation suppressed formation of sporangia on sporangiophores as compared with all other treatments. In field studies, dimethomorph, fosetyl-Al, and trifloxystrobin suppressed development of shoots with systemic downy mildew to the greatest extent when applied near the timing of inoculation, although the duration of preventative and postinfection activity varied among the fungicides. There was a small reduction in efficacy of disease control when fosetyl-Al was applied 6 to 7 days after inoculation as compared with protective applications.

Since conidia concentration is {{strongly related to}} disease intensity, it is an effective approach for forecasting powder mildews to explore the relationship between meteorological factors and conidia concentration. To assess effects of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the sporulation of P. clandestina, experiments were conducted using mature colonies of powdery mildew on the detached leaves. Study showed that sporulation were optimized at the T of 22 °C and RH of 85 %, and that 8 h incubation in dark with T of 10 °C and RH of 70 - 90 % were favorable to sporulation. Similar studies were conducted to determine effects of RH on sporulation of P. macularis at 20 °C. Results demonstrated {{that there was a}} significant negative linear relationship between conidia and RH at 80 - 97. 5 % during 48 h incubation. Under 24 h fluctuating RH conditions, 8 h incubation at RH of 80 % was favorable to sporulation. In the studies of ultraviolet (UV), conidia were trapped using Burkard volumetric sampler. Results showed that low levels of UV resulted in higher population of E. necator conidia, while high UV had the opposite effect. The thresholds of UV-B and UV-A were 0. 5 W/m 2 and 13 W/m 2, respectively. The results of cross correlation analysis described negative relationship of UV with conidia concentration in current day and the previous two days. The cross correlations of conidia concentrations with UV-A were - 0. 306 in lag 0 and - 0. 182 in lag 2, and with UV-B were - 0. 311 in lag 0 and - 0. 235 in lag 2.

This emerging disease caused severe economic losses to hop growers, {{due in part to}} the lack of resistance incorporated into commercial varieties. Despite several collection trips that increased the amount of wild hop (Humulus lupulus L.) germplasm available to researchers, there was no knowledge of its potential as a resource for resistance to P. macularis. The objectives of this study were: 1) to collect previously unrepresented native hop seed from the Southwestern United States, 2) to evaluate wild hop germplasm for resistance to P. macularis, and 3) to microscopically examine the progression of powdery <b>mildew</b> on different <b>hop</b> genotypes. Plant collecting expeditions were taken in September of 2002 and 2003 to obtain wild American hop germplasm (H. l. var. neomexicanus) from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. During these expeditions, 60 seedlots and 28 plant accessions were obtained. This germplasm was deposited at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), located in Corvallis, Oregon. More than 2, 100 wild (1563 North American and 107 Kazakhstani) hop seedlings, from 54 seedlots were evaluated for powdery mildew resistance. The number of resistant seedlings observed when greenhouse temperatures were > 30 °C was 218. The number of resistant seedlings decreased to 62 when greenhouse temperatures were 30 °C) prior to inoculation. The development of P. macularis on several native North American and Kazakhstani hop genotypes was observed using direct light microscopy. The disease progressed slower on native genotypes than on the susceptible H. l. 'Symphony'. Conidia on the resistant cultivar 'Nugget' produced only the primary germ tube prior to shriveling. On 3 infected native Kazakhstani genotypes, epidermal cells at the center of the colony began to collapse at 120 h, forming a lesion that continued to radiate outward. Fungal hyphae then shriveled in response to epidermal collapse. As a result of this work, new sources of resistance to powdery mildew were identified. A high percentage of resistant seedlings were observed in specific lots from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota. Resistant genotypes from North America and Kazakhstan may lead to germplasm releases for use in hop breeding programs. The partial resistance observed in wild hops suggests that multiple genes are involved. This type of resistance would be more durable than single gene resistance, which is easily overcome by the evolution of more virulent pathotypes...|$|R

In <b>hop,</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (caused by Podosphaera macularis) is most damaging to cones when infection occurs during bloom and the juvenile stages of cone development. Experiments were conducted over 3 years to evaluate whether fungicide applications could be ceased after the most susceptible stages of cone development (late July) without unduly affecting crop yield and quality when disease pressure was moderated with varying levels of basal foliage removal. In experimental plots of ‘Galena’ hop, the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew was similar whether fungicides were ceased in late July or made in late August. Disease levels on leaves were unaffected by the intensity of basal foliage removal, whereas the intensity of basal foliage removal interacted with the duration of fungicide applications to affect disease levels on cones. Similar experiments conducted in large plots of ‘Tomahawk’ hop in a commercial hop yard similarly found no significant impact on disease levels on leaves from either the duration of fungicide applications or intensity of basal foliage removal. In contrast, on cones, application of fungicides into August had a modest, suppressive effect on powdery mildew. There was also some evidence that the level of powdery mildew on cones associated with fungicide treatment was influenced by the intensity of basal foliage removal. When fungicide applications ceased in late July, there was a progressive decrease in the incidence of cones with powdery mildew with increasing intensity of basal foliage removal. Removing basal foliage two to three times allowed fungicide applications to be terminated in late July rather than late August without diminishing disease control on cones, yield, or cone quality factors. Thus, this study further establishes that fungicide applications made during the early stages of hop cone development have the strongest effect on suppression of powdery mildew on cones. The additive effect of fungicide applications targeted to the periods of greatest cone susceptibility and canopy management to reduce disease favorability may obviate the need for fungicide applications later in the season. This appears to be a viable strategy in mature hop yards of certain cultivars when disease pressure is not excessively high...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of integrated management of plant diseases incorporates a vast body of scientific information for effective pathogen control {{as well as}} environmental stewardship. Pathogen biology, environmental and epidemiological patterns, preventative cultural practices and judicious chemical applications are {{a few examples of}} the scientific areas of research used to support integrated disease management. This body of work focuses on research involved in the integrated disease management approach: cover cropping, early detection of plant pathogens and a pathogen population study. The first chapter explores the effects of mixed-species cover crops on organic tomato crop productivity and disease severity in the field. This research, taken over three field seasons (2010, 2011 and 2012) at sixteen field sites in three states, Maryland, New York and Ohio (MD, NY and OH), each with distinct soilborne disease pressure, was based on measurement of plant growth and vigor, crop yield and disease ratings of naturally occurring infection over time. Our research revealed no short-term effects of cover crop treatments on productivity or disease severity in tomato crops. The second chapter looked at the same tomato crops, turning attention to how the cover crops affect fungal and oomycete pathogen presence in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. For this, two years (2010 and 2011) of field samples from 260 plots were evaluated using two molecular tools: macroarray analysis, a diagnostic tool used to test for the presence of 31 solanaceous pathogens, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), used to evaluate the microbial fingerprint of the samples. Our findings showed that cover crops did not affect pathogen presence in the rhizosphere and that macroarray was able to detect certain fungi with much greater sensitivity than T-RFLP. Chapter 3 explores the development of techniques used for early detection of Pseudoperonospora cubensis and P. humuli, causal agents of cucurbit and <b>hop</b> downy <b>mildews,</b> respectively. Two techniques were designed which allow for detection and differentiation of both pathogens from environmental samples: real-time PCR with locked-nucleic acid probes and high resolution melt curve analysis. These assays were then used to test for pathogen presence in air samples collected in New York using spore traps. Chapter 4 presents the results of a comparative analysis between RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genotyping by sequencing (GBS) conducted in order to determine which technique is most effective in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification for Pseudoperonospora cubensis and P. humuli, as well as to discover novel SNPs that determine population structure between and among these two genetically similar species. Finally, included in the appendix is a case study summarizing a collaboration with St. John's University in Tanzania, facilitated by a Horticulture Collaborative Research Support Program grant. The project aims were to train a graduate student in extension talks for IPM of tomato, implement the talks with growers and a pesticide alternative in an experiment-based field study. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
