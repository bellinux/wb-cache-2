5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E

My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.|$|E

25|$|Seishirō {{encounters}} Subaru for {{one final}} {{fight in the}} Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishirō heads in for the finishing blow. Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> Seishirō's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead. Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed {{the same way she}} was. Seishirō knew this, effectively committing suicide as Fūma states Subaru's wish was dying at Seishirō's hands. After the battle, Fūma offers Subaru Seishirō's remaining intact eye, revealing that it was Seishirō's wish to erase Fūma's trace on Subaru, which Subaru accepts. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the 14th Sakurazukamori and one of the Dragons of Earth. A sidestory in the series also shows Seishiro becoming the Sakurazukamori by killing his mother who tells him he will also be killed by the person he loves.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns to}} Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her {{authority}} when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return"). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying [...] "no" [...] too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.|$|E
