[...] Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was [...] "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that [...] "No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy - a comparison which [...] "does [...] "Strangers" [...] no favors. Vacancy director Nimród Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive." [...] Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post panned the film, calling it [...] "a fraud from start to finish." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film [...] "uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile," [...] but admitted that [...] "it does it well, with more than usual skill." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, [...] "Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. <b>He</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> under our skin with a pile driver." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Newark Star-Ledger opined of the film, [...] "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody." ...|$|E
