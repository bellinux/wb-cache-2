5000|$|Bound by Flame {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{was criticized}} for its lack of deeper character development, relationship building with party members, poor AI system, short length, and poor combat that gives the game an unnecessary difficulty. Excessive and inappropriate swearing and profanity to give the game an artificial edge as well as out of place jokes and misplaced dialogue and information have also been cited. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot stated that there are several questionable design choices such as when [...] "you're asked to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> for your character—a name that is then summarily ignored by the game's supporting cast... This identity crisis may seem a minor detail, {{but it is a}} head-scratcher of an issue in a role-playing game full of head-scratchers, each one more stymieing than the last."

30|$|While {{viewed as}} a {{negative}} aspect of participation in technology-mediated learning environments, allowing anonymity can foster deep and enriched participation. Providing anonymous participation in a learning environment can encourage wider participation as it inculcates a sense of safety and privacy (White and Dorman 2001). The way Kahoot! {{was used in the}} course allowed students to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> of choice into the system each time they participated. Students could decide if they wished to remain anonymous or identify themselves. Anonymity allowed students’ to feel safer when responding to questions. It also allowed students to focus on comparing the content of Kahoot! and differences of opinion, rather than comparing students’ aptitudes. This encouraged participation, as students were able to take part without feeling that they were being judged for answering correctly or incorrectly. Several respondents described funny names within the Kahoot! adding positively to the element of fun and social learning in game-based environments (Squire 2011). However, this also had the potential to shift the focus away from learning as students became distracted and no longer took the Kahoot! seriously.|$|E
