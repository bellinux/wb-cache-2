40|$|We {{investigated}} cues that {{mediate the}} aggregation behavior of immature <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bugs</b> by using nymphs of six different <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bug</b> species (Nezara viridula, Acrosternum hilare, Chlorochroa ligata, Chlorochroa sayi, Thyanta pallidovirens, and Euschistus conspersus). When first instars of any two species were {{put together in}} a Petri dish, they readily formed heterospecific aggregations similar to their natural conspecific aggregations. The chemical profiles of first and second instar nymphs of each species were determined by solvent extraction with pentane, followed by GC-MS analysis. Immature bugs of the different species had some compounds in common, and some that were more species specific. Within a species, there were distinct differences in the profiles of compounds extracted from first and second instars. Bugs did not aggregate around untreated polysulfone beads (1 mm diam) that were glued together in groups approximating bug egg masses, suggesting that tactile cues alone were insufficient to induce aggregation. Furthermore, when tested over a range of doses, groups of polysulfone beads treated with crude whole-body extracts of bugs did not induce or maintain aggregations. However, first instar N. viridula nymphs did respond to beads treated {{with two of the}} three major components of bug extracts. 4 -Oxo-(E) - 2 -decenal induced significant aggregations at two doses, whereas tridecane, the major component in extracts from all six species, did not, and (E) - 2 -decenal was repellent.

40|$|Trissolcus egg parasitoids, when perceiving the {{chemical}} footprints {{left on a}} substrate by <b>pentatomid</b> host <b>bugs,</b> adopt a motivated searching behaviour characterized by longer searching time on patches were signals are present. Once in contact with host chemical footprints, Trissolcus wasps search longer on traces left by associated hosts rather than non-associated species, and, in the former case, they search longer on traces left by females than males. Based on these evidences, we hypothesized that only associated hosts induce the ability to discriminate host sex in wasps. To test this hypothesis we investigated the ability of Trissolcus basalis, T. brochymenae, and Trissolcus sp. to distinguish female from male Nezara viridula, Murgantia histrionica, and Graphosoma semipunctatum footprints. These three <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bugs</b> were selected according to variable association levels. Bioassays were conducted on filter paper sheets, and on Brassica oleracea (broccoli) leaves.

40|$|Seasonal {{patterns}} of abundance {{and distribution of}} all life stages of known Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) host species on different plant species in a soybean agricultural system in southeastern Queensland, Australia are reported. In particular, the seasonal phenology of different bug species is described with emphasis on periods of oviposition. Twelve hosts for T. basalis were identified, with three <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bugs,</b> <b>green</b> vegetable bug, green stink bug, and horehound bug, predominating. These three species appear to undergo at least three generations per year with mating and oviposition occurring during all months between September and April but mainly during October and January–April. Horehound bug is the only known T. basalis host that does not diapause during winter and continues to oviposit during winter at low levels. These results suggest that T. basalis is not host limited temporally except during winter when hosts are scarce. Results also show that T. basalis hosts are spatially aggregated {{at a number of}} levels, but how this affects T. basalis and the subsequent degree of biological control has yet to be investigated...|$|R

Abundances were compared early and {{late in the season}} in different sized patches of the cucurbit host plant (Cayaponia americana) growing in open habitat (with no surrounding plant community) and forest habitat (with diverse surrounding plant community). For both herbivore species, adult abundances per patch were positively correlated with patch leaf area, but there was a significant patch size effect (i. e., correlation between herbivore density per unit plant and patch leaf area) only for beetles in the forest habitat. Both herbivore species were significantly affected by surrounding plant diversity, but in opposite ways: beetles were more abundant in open patches whereas bugs were more abundant in forest patches. Relationships between abundance and patch size in open and forest patches changed through the season for both herbivore species. These changing abundance patterns are discussed with respect to (1) increases in the diversity of the plant community surrounding host plant patches, and (2) differences in herbivore movement patterns...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} insect attack by {{emission}} of volatile organic compounds, which recruit natural {{enemies of the}} attacking herbivore, constituting an indirect plant defence strategy. In this context, the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis is attracted by oviposition-induced plant volatiles emitted by Vicia faba plants {{as a consequence of}} feeding and oviposition by the pentatomid host Nezara viridula. However, this local tritrophic web could be affected by the recent invasion by the alien <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bug</b> Halyomorpha halys, an herbivore that shares the same environments as native pentatomid pests. Therefore, we investigated in laboratory conditions the possible impact of H. halys on the plant volatile-mediated signalling in the local tritrophic web V. faba–N. viridula–T. basalis. We found that T. basalis wasps were not attracted by volatiles induced in the plants by feeding and oviposition activities of H. halys, indicating specificity in the wasps’ response. However, the parasitoid attraction towards plant volatiles emitted as a consequence of feeding and oviposition by the associated host was disrupted when host, N. viridula, and non-associated host, H. halys, were concurrently present on the same plant, indicating that invasion by the alien herbivore interferes with established semiochemical webs. These outcomes are discussed in a context of multiple herbivory by evaluating the possible influences of alien insects on local parasitoid foraging behaviour...|$|R

The olfactory systems of psyllids and aphids are generally very small, with low numbers of afferents in comparison to other insect groups, and the smallest described so far belongs to T. apicalis, comprising less than 50 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Originally, we tried to estimate numbers of olfactory glomeruli in the AL of T. apicalis, which in insects generally correspond closely {{to the number of}} different types of ORNs. Neither immunocytochemical staining nor anterograde staining of ORNs revealed any glomerular structures in the ALs of T. apicalis or the 2 aphids that were included for comparison. In contrast, the ALs of the <b>pentatomid</b> stink <b>bug</b> E. heros displayed numerous distinct and well-delineated glomeruli, showing that aglomerular ALs are not typical of all insects within the order Hemiptera.

40|$|Tethered {{flight of}} six insect species (two <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bugs,</b> a moth, a butterfly, a muscid fl y and a crane fly) was studied using several {{modifications}} of a dust flow visualization procedure. The spatial {{structure of the}} near vortex wake of flying specimens was reconstructed {{on the basis of}} two-dimensional flow pictures. The dynamics of the wake was followed during a stroke cycle, revealing interspecific differences in vortex formation. It is suggested that insects create a single vortex ring during each stroke. Therefore, the hypothesis of double vortex chains advanced by Brodsky is not verified. The same is true of the jet hypothesis of Bocharova-Messner. While pronating {{at the top of their}} trajectory, the flapping wings throw air masses off their lower surfaces, but there is not a jet from between their upper sides. Flow separation from leading edges was found to be a rare phenomenon, taking place irregularly during the stroke cycle. That is why, contrary to widespread theoretical expectations, the Weis-Fogh fling mechanism is not likely to contain a leading edge separation bubble, which must follow stalling at the front part of the wings. It is suggested that flying animals possess special mechanisms for extracting energy back from the near vortex wake. Some hypothetical adaptations for such an extraction in insects are put forward. Possible pathways for the evolution of insect flight are described...|$|R

40|$|Herbivores {{employ a}} variety of chemical, {{behavioural}} and morphological defences to reduce mortality from natural enemies. In some caterpillars the head capsules of successive instars are retained and stacked {{on top of each}} other and it has been suggested that this could serve as a defence against natural enemies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the survival of groups of the gumleaf skeletoniser Uraba lugens Walker caterpillars, allocated to one of three treatments: “−HC,” where stacked head capsules were removed from all individuals, “+HC,” where the caterpillars retained their stacked head capsules, and “mixed,” where only half of the caterpillars in a group had their stacked head capsules removed. We found no difference in predation rate between the three treatments, but within the mixed treatment, caterpillars with head capsules were more than twice as likely to survive. During predator choice trials, conducted to observe how head capsule stacking acts as a defence, the predatory <b>pentatomid</b> <b>bug</b> attacked the −HC caterpillar in four out of six trials. The two attacks on +HC caterpillars took over 10 times longer because the bug would poke its rostrum through the head capsule stack, while the caterpillar used its head capsule stack to deflect the bug’s rostrum. Our results support the hypothesis that the retention of moulted head capsules by U. lugens provides some protection against their natural enemies and suggest that this is because stacked head capsules can function as a false target for natural enemies as well as a weapon to fend off attackers. This represents the first demonstration of a defensive function...|$|R
