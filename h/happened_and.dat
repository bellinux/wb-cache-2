5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, {{as he did}} {{not explain}} what had <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> the people feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E
5|$|At a {{hotel in}} Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub) walks along a {{corridor}} up to reach a door, which he then frantically knocks on while shouting the name ″Morris″. Banton's shouts {{attract the attention of}} Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> flees the scene.|$|E
5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning.

I passed out when the explosion <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> that was when I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw what had <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet {{to one of his}} bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E

5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E

Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} week of September, a strong {{tropical}} wave began to emerge off the coast of Africa. It was well-organized from the start, and on September 11, even before it emerged off the coast, the National Hurricane Center predicted that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression. That is indeed what <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12. The enormous size of the depression made it fairly slow to develop, combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the Saharan Air Layer to the north as it tracked south of the Cape Verde islands. Convection was also slow to build in, with little banding at first. The initial strengthening was delayed as a result. However, on September 13, the organization improved as banding became better defined, and that evening, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never <b>happened,</b> <b>and</b> that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> {{that the only way}} to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) {{immediately}} arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
