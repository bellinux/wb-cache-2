25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|For all its {{usefulness}} in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes {{such as those}} exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which {{can be described in}} the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes {{in the development of the}} various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and symbolic language of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that such formal systems actually propose to be talking about.|$|E
500|$|In Cleveland, the {{narrative}} follows {{the point of}} view of a hotel concierge named Ruwan as the city falls under attack by Covenant forces. In the mayhem he meets a woman named Myras Tyla. Tyla [...] remains calm even as Ruwan edges towards all-out panic. The pair are captured and with other residents herded into a sports stadium. The Covenant declare that the humans must give up the location of the Key to save their lives; Tyla is confused, but Ruwan states he knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

She knows how to really make a party a party. That's what I want – to make this record to be the {{ultimate}} party record. That's pretty much how that all came about. ... I guess each time we work together, we give 100% of our energy to each other. It's crazy. Sometimes you can't explain what the chemistry is. It's just how you feel.|$|E
500|$|Reinfeldt {{has said}} that he left the Church of Sweden when he was {{eighteen}} years old, critical of the left-leaning perspectives of the church. In an interview as Prime Minister he however said that he could not state if he believed in God, discussing his belief [...] "that something exist that is not just about the scientific explanation for how the Earth was created. But <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> I don't have an answer for, I am both searching and wondering." [...] He was however married, and had his children baptized in the Church of Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Warp {{drive was}} first {{mentioned}} in Gene Roddenberry's first-draft pitch for Star Trek, dated March 11, 1964, although in that version it {{was referred to}} as a [...] "space-warp drive". The drive allows for a vessel to travel faster than the speed of light by warping space-time around the ship itself. In 1994, physicist Miguel Alcubierre created the theoretical Alcubierre drive, which used a similar theory. In the Star Trek universe, Zefram Cochrane invented the drive in 2063. Cochrane was portrayed by James Cromwell in the film [...] and re-appeared in this role in the pilot of Enterprise, [...] "". That episode showed the culmination of the development of the warp 5 engine, which was designed by Jonathan Archer's father, Henry, in the launch of the Enterprise itself. The Vulcans during this period gave oversight and advice to Starfleet {{in the development of the}} warp drive, but sought to slow the progress of the humans. [...] "First Flight" [...] showed a previously unseen period in the development of the fictional warp drive, with the pursuit of the warp 2 barrier. The dark matter seen in this episode is a real phenomenon, however it is unclear <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> It cannot be seen by telescopes, and it is theorised that it makes up a great deal of the matter in the universe.|$|E

2500|$|Brains {{must have}} {{something}} that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it [...] "causal powers". [...] "Causal powers" [...] is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have [...] "equivalent causal powers". [...] "Equivalent causal powers" [...] is whatever else {{that could be used}} to make a mind.|$|E
2500|$|Edouard Saouma, the Director-General of FAO, {{was also}} criticised in Graham Hancock's book Lords of Poverty, {{published}} in 1989. Mention {{is made of}} Saouma's 'fat pay packet', his 'autocratic' management style, and his 'control over the flow of public information'. Hancock concluded that [...] "One gets the sense {{from all of this}} of an institution that has lost its way, departed from its purely humanitarian and developmental mandate, become confused about its place in the world – about <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> doing, and why". Despite the criticism, Edouard Saouma served as DG for three consecutive terms from 1976 to 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Reflective of the Queen Anne Style architecture, {{the house}} also {{incorporates}} elements of Stick Style and Eastlake Style.

2500|$|The Idiot is a perfect, and {{her most}} famous, example of this. Her color palette is {{extremely}} vivid and striking. Malfatti makes great use of primary colors, and she outlines her subject in black which clearly defines {{the shape of}} the chair and the woman, but which leaves the background indiscernible as to <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> representing. The brush-strokes are large and imperfect as well and do not lend a solid feeling of spatial organization to the painting. Instead, the woman and the background seem to exist on the same plane, only being separated by color movement and shapes. The subject of a woman seated on a chair is nothing remarkable in the art world, but the subject title of the piece as well as the striking upward glance of the woman's eyes explains how it would be shocking to a conservative Brazilian culture. Not only is Malfatti painting an (as it would seem) underbelly representation of society, but she is doing so at a time when society was searching for a [...] "Brazilian" [...] style. All of a sudden it becomes uncertain what Malfatti is representing of Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E

30|$|Especially {{for large}} companies, this {{top-down}} approach to agility {{has affected the}} actual transition to agile, which should be rooted on establishing the core agile values and principles.

5000|$|There {{were those}} who protested that the action of setting up NDRC was an end run, a grab by which a small company of {{scientists}} and engineers, acting outside established channels, got hold of the authority and money for the program of developing new weapons.

5000|$|Operating systems {{made for}} {{computers}} with blinkenlights, for example, RSTS/E and RSX-11, would frequently have an idle task blink the panel lights in some recognizable fashion.
