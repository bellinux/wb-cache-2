This dissertation {{covers the}} commissioning {{and testing of}} an aircraft's constant frequency alternator as the power supply for the Blue Parrot radar. The Blue Parrot is an X-band radar which forms part of the navigation and weapon-aiming system onboard the Buccaneer S- 50 SAAF aircraft. The radar set uses a source of three-phase power at 400 Hz, which the constant frequency alternator can supply {{with the aid of}} certain auxiliary systems. The auxiliary systems include a prime mover, blower fan and a telemetering system. The prime mover has high starting currents which were reduced significantly by the use of a soft-starter. During testing, the constant frequency alternator started overheating and a blower fan was selected based on its thermal requirements. Significant cooling of the constant frequency alternator's case temperature was achieved by the use of a blower fan and shroud. The <b>generator</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> monitors and regulates all parameters on the unit except for case temperature and blower fan pressure.

Edges (links) between nodes represent the flow of entities including products, services, and information. Nodes are linked directly or indirectly. If a node j is linked to a node j^' directly, there is an edge between the two nodes. When two nodes j and j^' are linked indirectly, {{there is at least one}} path between j and j^' through other nodes so that entities can be diffused from j to j^' and/or from j^' to j. When two nodes are not linked, there is no path between the two nodes. Entities may flow along both directions between two nodes connected by an undirected edge [10, 11, 13]. Directed edges are also called arcs; entities may flow along only one direction between two nodes connected by an arc.|$|R
40|$|Differential {{protection}} {{is a popular}} method to protect aircraft generators against winding faults. Traditional relay-based systems have a limited capability to distinguish between differential current resulting from a winding fault, and the one resulting from measurement noise or current saturation, resulting in false alarms and unnecessary equipment shutdown. Modern aircraft generators are monitored and <b>controlled</b> by advanced <b>generator</b> <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> and therefore, sophisticated signal processing algorithms can be implemented to enhance the differential protection performance. We propose and compare four different differential detector designs, based on the available information about measured currents, for detection of persistent, short circuit faults in the protected windings. Also, current sensors are subject to intermittent, open circuit, cable faults, resulting in degradation in the differential detection performance. We propose an optimal differential protection architecture, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, to detect winding short circuit faults {{in the presence of}} intermittent cable faults. In this architecture, the system switches between two different detectors, depending on the cable health state. ...|$|R
40|$|IEEE Hybrid {{electric}} bus (HEB) {{presents an}} emerging solution to {{exhaust gas emissions}} in urban transport. This paper proposes a multiport bidirectional switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive for solar-assisted HEB (SHEB) powertrain, which not only improves the motoring performance, but also achieves flexible charging functions. To extend the driving miles and achieve self-charging ability, photovoltaic (PV) panels are installed on the bus to decrease the reliance on fuels/batteries and charging stations. A bidirectional front-end circuit with a PV-fed circuit is designed to integrate electrical components into one converter. Six driving and five charging modes are achieved. The dc voltage is boosted by the battery in <b>generator</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (GCU) driving mode and by the charge capacitor in battery driving mode, where the torque capability is improved. Usually, an extra dc-dc converter is needed to achieve battery charging. In this paper, the battery can be directly charged by the demagnetization current in GCU or PV driving mode, and can be quickly charged by the PV panels and GCU/AC grids at SHEB standstill condition, by utilizing the traction motor windings and converter circuit, without external charging converters.

The thirst for energy is jeopardizing the self-sufficiency and security of the deployed warfighter. Improvements to equipment and the employment of renewable energy systems fail to address the impact that human behavior has on energy consumption and overlooks a tremendous opportunity. The Marine Corps' return to its expeditionary posture as a fast, austere and lethal force requires that it {{come to terms with}} energy consumption. The data and analysis presented in this thesis identifies behavioral trends and indicates that significant energy savings can be obtained through a concerted effort and behavior-change strategy that includes training and education, policy and planning, leadership and communication to improve individual and organizational awareness of the importance of efficient and effective use of energy.

To tackle this difficulty, a non-invasive intestinal bio-robot system with active actuation based on nerve stimulation was developed. Methods This intestinal inspection system utilized a natural organism—the mud eel—to serve as the locomotion mechanism, and it was controlled by a LabVIEW-programmed pulse <b>generator.</b> The exterior <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was able to actively drive and remotely control the navigation and site-specific anchoring of the organism. Results Through in vitro stimulation experiments, a method of controlling the organism’s forward motion was obtained: when the organism was stimulated at the tail, it moved forward at a relatively fast speed and with high repeatability. The stimulator parameters were as follows: amplitude 1. 85 μA, frequency 2 Hz, pulse duration 500 μs. Conclusions Since this is a preliminary study, considerable work remains to be done.

40|$|Multiple {{efforts have}} been made to develop small-diameter tissue {{engineered}} vascular grafts using a great variety of bioreactor systems at different steps of processing. Nevertheless, there is still an extensive need for a compact all-in-one system providing multiple and simultaneous processing. The aim of this project was to develop a new device to fulfill the major requirements of an ideal system that allows simultaneous seeding, conditioning, and perfusion. The newly developed system can be actuated in a common incubator and consists of six components: a rotating cylinder, a pump, a pulse <b>generator,</b> a <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> a mixer, and a reservoir. Components that are in direct contact with cell media, cells, and/or tissue allow sterile processing. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed with polyurethane tubes and collagen tubes. The scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts and endothelial cells that were isolated from human saphenous vein segments. Scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed better seeding success of polyurethane scaffolds in comparison to collagen. Conditioning of polyurethane tubes with 100 dyn/cm 2 resulted in cell detachments, whereas a moderate conditioning program with stepwise increase of shear stress from 10 to 40 dyn/cm 2 induced a stable and confluent cell layer. The new bioreactor is a powerful tool for quick and easy testing of various scaffold materials for the development of tissue engineered vascular grafts. The combination of this bioreactor with native tissue allows testing of medical devices and medicinal substances under physiological conditions that is a good step towards reduction of animal testing. In the long run, the bioreactor could turn out to produce tissue engineered vascular grafts for human applications “at the bedside”...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn many animals, {{individual}} legs {{can either}} function independently, as in {{behaviors such as}} scratching or searching, or be used in coordinated patterns with other legs, as in walking or climbing. While the control of walking has been extensively investigated, the mechanisms mediating the behavioral choice to activate individual legs independently are poorly understood. We examined this issue in stick insects, in which each leg can independently produce a rhythmic searching motor pattern if it doesn’t find a foothold [1 – 4]. We show here that one non-spiking interneuron, I 4, controls searching behavior in individual legs. One I 4 is present in each hemi-segment of the three thoracic ganglia [5, 6]. Search-inducing sensory input depolarizes I 4. I 4 activity was necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain searching movements. When substrate contact was provided, I 4 depolarization no longer induced searching. I 4 therefore both integrates search-inducing sensory input and is gated out by other sensory input (substrate contact). Searching thus occurs only when it is behaviorally appropriate. I 4 depolarization never elicited stepping. These data show that individual, locally activated neurons can mediate the behavioral choice to use individual legs independently. This mechanism may be particularly important in insects’ front legs, which can function independently like vertebrate arms and hands [7]. Similar local command mechanisms that selectively activate the pattern <b>generators</b> <b>controlling</b> repeated functional <b>units</b> such as legs or body segments may be present in other systems...|$|R

The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems.
