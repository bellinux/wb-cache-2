5|$|Gary Player {{became the}} first non-American to win the Masters in 1961, beating Palmer, the {{defending}} champion. In 1974, he won again by two strokes. After not winning a tournament on the U.S. PGA tour <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> years, and {{at the age of}} 42, Player won his third and final Masters in 1978 by one stroke over three players. Player currently shares (with Fred Couples) the record of making 23 consecutive cuts, and has played in a record 52 Masters.|$|E
5|$|Having {{dominated}} Zimbabwe's politics <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> decades, Mugabe {{has been}} a controversial and divisive figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans to be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E
5000|$|James Babbage [...] "Jim" [...] Wells Jr. (1850-1923) was a lawyer, rancher, and Democratic Party boss of South Texas.

5|$|On {{the counts}} under {{which he was}} convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but {{received}} credit <b>for</b> the <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> years during {{which he had been}} in custody awaiting trial. Peter Maguire observes that given the status of the defendants and the body of evidence against them, the sentences given to all those indicted in the Ministries Trial were light.|$|R
50|$|Federico set {{his hand}} to the {{political}} imperative and began a reorganization of the state, which also included a restructuring of the city according to a modern conception - comfortable, efficient and beautiful.

5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> years after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, would have become acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E
5|$|After {{being away}} <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> months, Michaels {{would make a}} {{surprise}} return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of Raw Is War. Michaels would continue to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called The Corporation as a villain. Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on Raw, in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches. On the January 4, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, but disappeared from WWF television {{for a few weeks}} to have back surgery {{and by the time he}} returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the next couple of months.|$|E
5|$|Busch studied <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> {{years at}} Hanover, despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in understanding the}} subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the Düsseldorf Art Academy. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination. His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to Düsseldorf in June 1851, where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes. Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to Antwerp to continue study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts under Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans. He led his parents {{to believe that the}} Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study old masters. At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Adriaen Brouwer, David Teniers and Frans Hals. The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills. Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from typhus, he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.|$|E
60|$|As the Christmas {{holidays}} approached, {{we prepared}} for the amusements of that joyous season. On the morning before Christmas, a gentleman, who had spent {{the first part of}} the winter all alone at his outpost, arrived to pass the holidays at York Factory.

The route network at JFK Airport was taken over by Trans States Airlines, with the majoritiy of TWE's fleet of then 11 ATR 42s being acquired by Mahalo Air.|$|R
5|$|By 1797, Britain {{and the new}} French Republic {{had been}} engaged in the French Revolutionary Wars <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> years. Although there had been {{significant}} fighting in Europe, the East Indies had remained largely under British control. French forces in the region were limited, and apart from a few raiding cruises the French squadron in the region had been under intermittent blockade at Île de France. The Royal Navy, commanded in Eastern waters by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier had focused on commerce protection {{and the elimination of}} the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic, capturing Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies in 1795 and 1796. Rainier had been engaged in pacifying local uprisings around Malacca during {{the latter part of the}} campaign, and there had been few forces left in reserve to protect British interests in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 season, {{all of the}} WindSeekers except Kings Island's {{experienced}} {{incidents in}} which the ride stopped, stranding riders in the air. Two such incidents occurred in September at Knott's Berry Farm, in one case leaving riders stranded {{at the top of}} the ride <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> hours, prompting the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to order the ride shut down indefinitely on September 19 pending investigation of both the length of time riders were stranded and the actual causes of the incidents. Two days later on September 21, Cedar Fair announced the closure of all other WindSeekers to conduct an internal review. The company said that until the review concludes, none of the rides would operate again. The rides remained closed through the remainder of the 2012 season at the five seasonal parks but reopened at all parks in 2013, excluding Knott's Berry Farm's version which has been relocated.|$|E
5|$|Japanese rule of Taiwan {{ended in}} 1945, {{following}} the armistice with the allies on September 2 {{and the subsequent}} appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from Mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence. The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following {{the demise of the}} imperial Qing. The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident, the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> decades.|$|E
50|$|While the Byzantine Empire was to {{continue}} <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> another <b>four</b> centuries, and the Crusades would contest {{the issue for}} some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkic ascendancy in Anatolia. The subsequent weakening of the Byzantine Empire and the political rivalry between the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm and the Fatimids in Egypt and southern Syria were the main factors that helped the Beyliks {{take advantage of the}} situation and unite their principalities.|$|R

5|$|The {{battalion}} departed the Middle East on 10 March 1942 {{aboard the}} troopship SS Otranto; however, on the voyage back to Australia the 16th and 17th Brigades were disembarked in Ceylon, due to {{fears of a}} Japanese attack. <b>For</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> months they were stationed on the island, initially in Galle, around the fort, and then later around the bay, where observation posts and section defensive positions were established. Throughout April and May, the 2/5th Battalion endured heavy rains but nevertheless undertook a series of exercises and training. In early July, the battalion finally received orders to return to Australia and, after being relieved at the Galle Fort by the 3rd Battalion, 8th Gurkhas, was transported to Colombo to embark upon the Athlone Castle. On 4 August 1942, the battalion arrived in Melbourne, having been away for over two years.|$|E

25|$|In May 1989, Baez {{performed}} at a music festival in communist Czechoslovakia called Bratislavská lýra. While there, she met future Czechoslovakian president Václav Havel, whom she let carry her guitar {{so as to}} prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of Charter 77, a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing a cappella <b>for</b> the <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's Velvet Revolution, the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown.|$|R

2500|$|Beginning in late 1979, Carmine Coppola {{composed}} a score incorporating themes taken {{from various sources}} such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Hector Berlioz, Bedřich Smetana, Felix Mendelssohn and George Frideric Handel. He composed three original themes: an heroic one for Napoleon, a love theme for scenes with Josephine, and a Buonaparte family theme. He also used French revolutionary songs that were supplied by Davis in early 1980 during a London meeting between Coppola, Davis and Brownlow. Two such songs were [...] "Ah! ça ira" [...] and [...] "La Carmagnole". Coppola returns to [...] "La Marseillaise" [...] as the finale. Coppola's score was heard first in New York at Radio City Music Hall performed <b>for</b> very <b>nearly</b> <b>four</b> hours, accompanying a film projected at 24 frames per second as suggested by producer Robert A.
