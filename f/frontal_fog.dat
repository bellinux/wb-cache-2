40|$|Fog events almost {{happened}} {{every year}} in cold season in North China Plain. In this study, hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was applied to analyze the formation of four fog events occurring in Ji’nan, China, {{during the period from}} March 2012 to February 2014. Three types of fog have been distinguished, including radiation fog, advection fog, and <b>frontal</b> <b>fog.</b> When fog events happened, the average surface temperature ranged from near zero to 10 °C and the relative humidity was around 90 %. Fog events often happened immediately after haze episodes (i. e., fog-haze) and sometimes after light rain. Back trajectory analyses show that the air masses during the fog events mostly came from the local Shandong areas and moved in very slow speed (4 – 24 [*]km[*]h− 1). During the fog events, the humidity along the air trajectories always gradually increased to saturation. The mixed layer depth was small, generally below 400 [*]m at noon and around 100 [*]m at midnight. However, the air temperature exhibited complex variations—sometimes decreased and sometimes kept stable or even increased...|$|E
40|$|Fog drop size {{distributions}} {{were collected}} from aircraft {{as part of the}} Synthetic Vision Technology Demonstration Program. Three west coast marine advection fogs, one <b>frontal</b> <b>fog,</b> and a radiation fog were sampled {{from the top of the}} cloud to the bottom as the aircraft descended on a 3 -degree glideslope. Drop size versus altitude versus concentration are shown in three dimensional plots for each 10 -meter altitude interval from 1 -minute samples. Also shown are median volume radius and liquid water content. Advection fogs contained the largest drops with median volume radius of 5 - 8 micrometers, although the drop sizes in the radiation fog were also large just above the runway surface. Liquid water content increased with height, and the total number of drops generally increased with time. Multimodal variations in number density and particle size were noted in most samples where there was a peak concentration of small drops (2 - 5 micrometers) at low altitudes, midaltitude peak of drops 5 - 11 micrometers, and high-altitude peak of the larger drops (11 - 15 micrometers and above). These observations are compared with others and corroborate previous results in fog gross properties, although there is considerable variation with time and altitude even in the same type of fog...|$|E
