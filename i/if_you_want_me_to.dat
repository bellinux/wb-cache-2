2500|$|On June 1, 1889, Wright {{married his}} first wife, Catherine Lee [...] "Kitty" [...] Tobin (1871–1959). The two had met around {{a year earlier}} during {{activities}} at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: [...] "Mr. Sullivan, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?" [...] With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot {{at the corner of}} Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of Oak Park. The existing Gothic Revival house was given to his mother, while a compact Shingle style house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.|$|E
2500|$|Hung {{entered her}} first Legislative Election {{campaign}} in 1989. Her KMT branch director objected to her request, and therefore {{did not give}} her time off during the campaign. Hung insisted on entering the primary and was only {{able to participate in}} the events on weekends as a candidate. She had her cousin go to the events on weekdays and hold up her poster whenever her name was called as a silent protest of her helpless absence. This was widely reported by the media and Hung won the primary by marginal votes, and thus was nominated by the party. Hung said, [...] "My father passed away the moment when I won the primary. It seemed that he was waiting for the final confirmation. I was whispering in his ear, 'Bless me with the nomination <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> embark on my career in this path of politics.'" [...] Hung subsequently won the seat in the legislative election and began her career in the Legislative Yuan for eight consecutive terms.|$|E
