40|$|In an {{evidence-based}} {{review of}} the relationship between volume and quality of care, the independent Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) concluded that volume appears to be related to outcome for certain surgical procedures (case fatality after pancreatic and oesophageal cancer) and that quality of care might be improved by centralisation. The Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement also identified conditions required for centralisation, particularly acceptance by professionals and hospitals. In the USA, programmes to improve quality ofcare initiated by the Leapfrog Group using volume criteria or, more recently, using 'public reporting' and 'pay for performance' principles have led to improvements in quality. In Canada, the Surgical Oncology programme within the Cancer System Quality <b>Index</b> <b>programme</b> has reduced case fatality following pancreatic resection. The Canadian programme was based not only on volume but also on standards, guidelines, rapid access strategies and publicly available performance assessments. In The Netherlands, the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate is introducing the so-called performance indicators of care.

Fisheries provide critical provisioning services, especially given increasing human population. Understanding where marine communities are declining provides an indication of ecosystems of concern and highlights potential conflicts between seafood provisioning from wild fisheries and other ecosystem services. Here we use the nonparametric statistic, Kendall's tau, to assess trends in biomass of exploited marine species across a range of ecosystems. The proportion of 'Non-Declining Exploited Species' (NDES) is compared among ecosystems and to three community-level indicators that provide a gauge of the ability of a marine ecosystem to function both in provisioning and as a regulating service: survey-based mean trophic level, proportion of predatory fish, and mean life span. In some ecosystems, NDES corresponds to states and temporal trajectories of the community indicators, indicating deteriorating conditions in both the exploited community and in the overall community. However differences illustrate the necessity of using multiple ecological indicators to reflect the state of the ecosystem. For each ecosystem, we discuss patterns in NDES with respect to the community-level indicators and present results in the context of ecosystem-specific drivers. We conclude that using NDES requires context-specific supporting information in order to provide guidance within a management framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of nongovernmental organisations which aim to adapt and develop simple forms of {{technology}} on the basis of existing knowledge. SATIS, which stands for Socially Appropriate Technology International Information Services, is designed to provide information on setting up, maintaining and using appropriate technology. SATIS is an international association established in 1982 by 25 organisations, chiefly NGOs, from throughout the world with the common objective of promoting economic and social progress in rural and semi-urban areas by developing appropriate technology projects. A few examples will indicate the range of activities undertaken by SATIS: the establishment of small palm oil extraction units in Cameroon, the organisation of cooperatives for growing and selling medicinal plants in Guatemala, improving local pottery to conserve food products in India, publishing agricultural information bulletins for Andean peasants, studies on environmental protection in Senegal, recording the traditional oral passing on of rural technoloav in Tanzania. The work of SATIS is divided into three project areas: access to and exchange of information, dissemination of information and the publication of resource guides. The annual List of Publications is a key feature of its activities, providing development agencies with access to 1500 publications, manuals and audio visual items available from members of the SATIS network. This Appropriate Technology and Development Publications List provides details in nine different languages of the material available, much of which originates from and is distributed by Third World countries The publications list {{is the first step in}} a programme of order services, SATIS bookshops, SATIS publications and a system of 'Book Tokens'. The recently launched SATIS tokens system helps development agencies and others to identify, locate and pay for information. Anyone interested chooses what they need from the List and then uses a token to obtain it from a SATIS member. Some of the organisations in ACP countries have limited resources or difficulty in converting their meagre resources into the necessary foreign currency or, like NGOs, do not qualify for official assistance in the acquisition of information. SATIS helps by producing guides to the organisations and programmes which can provide documentation or other forms of information. Such resource guides and overviews of appropriate technology activities already exist in Cameroon, Peru, Central America and The Netherlands. The SATIS Library Cards Ca talogues, which list approximately 10. 000 documents found in the libraries of network members, provide access to another form of detailed information. The documents listed are often unpublished or hard-to-obtain project descriptions. Users of this card <b>index</b> <b>programme</b> can obtain and keep copies of the documents at low cost. Since the catalogues are based on a selection of documents chosen by each network member, they provide clear guidelines and recommendations for the acquisition of the material. The catalogues are published annually and are available in card index form as a complete selection or according to subject matter; some copies are available on microfiche. SATIS does its utmost to help development organisations treat their information work as an essential part of their operations. In this context SATIS has helped in the preparations for the INTERDOC programme in which about 40 NGOs share skills and resources as part of a data processing project How do you become a member of SATIS ? Membership is open to organisations and individuals which share the objectives of SATIS and participate in at least one of its activities. Annual fees are US $ 100 for organisations and US $ 20 for individuals. In addition, all members undertake to make contributions in kind to the network by exchanging resources and information and organising seminars. There is also the status of 'associate partner' for organisations which cannot become full members, whether for legal reasons or because their own applied technology activities in the fields covered by SATIS constitute a relatively small part of their overall prgaramme. The last meeting of the SATIS General Assembly was held from 29 th November to 7 th December 1985 in New Delhi, India. This meeting evaluated the activities of the organisation and recommended future directions. It laid great stress on assessing both the technical quality of information to ensure its reliability and the scope for application of this information, monitoring the latest developments in information technology, adapting methods of communication to the specific needs and resources of those using it, and encouraging participants to play an active part in the network.

Methods: The cross-sectional study {{was based on a}} nationally representative interview survey of 11 178 ever-married women of reproductive age (15 - 49 years). A total of 4465 women who answered the IPV-related questions were analysed separately using chi(2) tests and Cramers V as a measure of effect size to identify the differences in proportions of exposure to IPV with regard to microfinance programme membership, and demographic variables and interactions between microfinance programme membership and factors related to non-economic empowerment were considered. Results: Only 39 % of women were members of microfinance programmes. The prevalence of a history of IPV was 48 % for moderate physical violence, 16 % for severe physical violence and 16 % for sexual violence. For women with secondary or higher education, and women at the two wealthiest levels of the wealth <b>index,</b> microfinance <b>programme</b> membership increased the exposure to IPV two and three times, respectively.

40|$|This report explores {{evidence}} and insights from five case {{studies that have}} made significant recent progress in addressing the challenge of insuring poor smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the developing world. In India, national <b>index</b> insurance <b>programmes</b> have reached over 30 million farmers through a mandatory link with agricultural credit and strong government support. In East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania), the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) has recently scaled to reach nearly 200, 000 farmers, bundling index insurance with agricultural credit and farm inputs. ACRE has built on strong partnerships with regional initiatives such as M-PESA mobile banking. In Ethiopia and Senegal, the R 4 Rural Resilience Initiative has scaled unsubsidized index insurance to over 20, 000 poor smallholder farmers who were previously considered uninsurable, using insurance {{as an integral part}} of a comprehensive risk management portfolio. With strong public and private sector support, the Mongolia Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP) insures more than 15, 000 nomadic herders and links commercial insurance with a government disaster safety net. Finally, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) project in Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrates innovative approaches to insuring poor nomadic pastoralists in challenging circumstances. A few common features appear to have contributed to recent progress within these case studies: explicitly targeting obstacles to improving farmer income; integration of insurance with other development interventions; giving farmers a voice in the design of products; investing in local capacity; and investing in science-based index development. Evidence from these case studies can inform the ongoing debate about the viability of scaling up index-based insurance for vulnerable smallholder farmers in the developing world. The rapid progress observed in recent years suggests that index insurance has the potential to benefit smallholder farmers at a meaningful scale, and suggests the need to reassess arguments that lack of demand and practical implementation challenges prevent index-based insurance from being a useful tool to reduce rural poverty...|$|R

Heavy metal pollution of soil is a significant environmental problem and has its negative impact on human health and agriculture. Rhizosphere, as an important interface of soil and plant, plays a significant role in phytoremediation of contaminated soil by heavy metals, in which, microbial populations are known to affect heavy metal mobility and availability to the plant through release of chelating agents, acidification, phosphate solubilization and redox changes. Phytoremediation of toxic heavy metals could be carried out by using specific metallophytes. Green plants are the lungs of nature with unique ability to purifying impure air by photosynthesis and remove or minimize heavy metals toxicity from soil and water ecosystem by absorption, accumulation and biotransformation process. This article paper reviews some recent advances in effect and significance of rhizobacteria in phytoremediation of heavy metal toxicity in contaminated soils. There is also a need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transfer and mobilization of heavy metals by rhizobacteria and to conduct research on the selection of microbial isolates from Rhizosphere of plants growing metal contaminated soils for specific restoration <b>programmes.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms- Environmental, heavy metal toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between poverty and corruption is well understood in many recent studies. This interaction {{can be a}} good tool and <b>index</b> to develop <b>programmes</b> in poverty reduction strategies. Corruption in the public sector is often viewed as exacerbating conditions of poverty. Scientist agrees that corruption directly does not produce poverty but it has direct implications on the economy and governance polices lead to poverty. Accordingly all reports and investigations in that respect are indirect. The Economic Model assumes that corruption limiting economic growth. On the other hand the absence of economic growth increases poverty. Inversely, tests have shown that an increase in Gross domestic product produces an increase in the income of the poor. However, income distribution is an important mediating factor because economic growth may not always benefit the poor. Corruption affects poverty by influencing governance factors, which, in turn, impact poverty levels. Corruption reduces governance capacity, and weakens political institutions and citizen participation and leads to lower quality government services and infrastructure. The poor suffer disproportionately from reduced public services. When health and basic education expenditures are given lower priority the illiteracy dominates the society and eventually reduces public trust in government institutions. This paper focuses on the linkage between corruption and poverty and demonstrates that corruption does exacerbate and promote poverty. ...|$|R

The beta angle, DCI and the superior/lateral femoral head displacement can be assessed via ultrasound to estimate the likelihood of success. Success rates of between 7 % and 99 % have been reported when using the harness to treat DDH. Avascular necrosis remains the most devastating complication of harness usage with a reported rate of between 0 % and 28 %. Alternative non-surgical treatment methods used for DDH include devices proposed by LeDamany, Frejka, Lorenz and Ortolani. The Rosen splint and Wagner stocking have also been used for DDH treatment. Surgical treatment for DDH comprises open reduction alongside a combination of femoral or pelvic osteotomies. Femoral osteotomies are carried out in cases of excessive anteversion or valgus deformity of the femoral neck. The two principal pelvic osteotomies most commonly performed are the Salter osteotomy and Pemberton acetabuloplasty. Serious surgical complications include epiphyseal damage, sciatic nerve damage and femoral neck fracture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Aims: In {{randomized}} controlled trials with high internal validity, pharmacotherapy using acamprosate, naltrexone, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, disulfiram has proved effective in preventing relapse {{in patients with}} alcohol use disorders (AUD). There remains, however, a paucity of studies with sufficient external validity in which the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in clinical practice is investigated. This study aimed {{to make a contribution}} to close this gap in research. Methods: In this naturalistic, prospective study, a comparison on indices of substance use, psychiatric symptoms, and treatment service utilization was carried out using samples of 92 patients who received pharmacotherapy and 323 patients who did not receive pharmacotherapy following discharge from 12 residential AUD <b>programmes</b> (<b>index</b> stay). Results: Patients that received pharmacotherapy were more likely to use alcohol during the index stay and at the 1 -year follow-up. Moreover, this patient group more readily utilized treatment services during a 2 -year period prior to and a 1 -year period following index stay than patients who were not given pharmacotherapy. Nevertheless, when pharmacotherapy was prescribed before first post-treatment alcohol use, it was associated with delay of alcohol use, fewer relapses, and a reduced need for inpatient treatment. In many cases, however, medication was not prescribed until alcohol use and relapse had occurred. The length of time to first alcohol use was longer, and the cumulative abstinence rate higher, for disulfiram than for acamprosate, the latter being generally prescribed for more severely alcohol-dependent patients. Conclusions: There is a need for further studies to probe the reasons why medication for relapse prevention is not prescribed upon discharge from residential treatment and for less severely alcohol-dependent patients...|$|R
40|$|Our {{interest}} in the computer processing of football commentary was at first given in by the EU/IST funded project MUMIS (Multimedia Indexing and Searching) that started in 2000 [11, 18, 19]. This project's objective is to develop technology for automatic <b>indexing</b> of multimedia <b>programme</b> material (texts, news streams, speech transcripts) {{and to develop a}} user interface that supports the conceptual querying and browsing of related video content over the internet. One of the innovative features of MUMIS is that it aims at the disclosure of video archives by applying information extraction techniques, originally developed for the textual domain. Information extraction is a technique that is typically suited for content in specific domains. In MUMIS the extraction technology is applied to the domain of football. The project requires the integration of lexicons, ontology and information extraction tools for this domain, and the development of merging algorithms to integrate the (incomplete) information coming from different sources. For example, the information extraction components should be able to extract some thirty different event types, using methods such as part of speech tagging, syntactic parsing, semantic tagging, and discourse analysis Typical football events to be detected are: kick-off, penalty, goal, halftime, free-kick, etc. The user interface should help users to formulate queries that can be matched on the annotations generated by the extraction component and linked to the time-codes of the corresponding video fragments. In parallel to the MUMIS project we surveyed a number of research efforts that deal all with football commentary but for which the technology focus differs: retrieval, interpretation or generation of commentary and related (but not necessarily language oriented) research. There were two reasons for this investigation. One obvious reason is to find out how the new technology and tools can be adapted to similar applications. The other is to see how the domain knowledge obtained for extraction purposes can be employed for other intelligent applications in the same domain. Since at the same time several of our M. Sc. students got interested in learning multi-agent systems for developing teams for the RoboCup leagues we decided to stick close to the football domain in this survey as well. In this paper we start with the survey of the domain specific research. The aim of the survey was to obtain a comprehensive view of the field could guide the selection of new research themes. In {{the second part of the}} paper we give a short introduction to the MUMIS project as it can be embedded in the general football related language technology research...|$|R
40|$|Environmental change {{presents}} {{the greatest challenges}} to biodiversity conservation. From climate changes to land cover conversion and pollution effects, global biodiversity faces many threats. Though conservation actions have been put into place to halt the loss of biodiversity, recent studies suggest that conservation actions have largely failed to do this. Hence, understanding the links between species responses, environmental pressures {{and the role of}} species characteristics in conferring resilience to these environmental pressures would be fundamental to develop adequate conservation measures. This thesis focuses on a range of approaches to investigate the impacts of well-known environmental pressures on the passerine community in the UK to try to uncover mechanisms underpinning species responses to environmental change. Furthermore, considering that bird species are currently been used as biodiversity indicators, it would be of great use to identify new venues to measure and monitor species responses to environmental change that would help improve the current set of indicators. Examining multiple pressures within the same analytical framework was valuable for demonstrating that land cover and pollution drivers are of equivalent importance to climate in structuring bird communities at a broad scale in the UK. Both community and niche studies revealed that winter conditions and pollution were key in structuring passerine communities together with pollution at this broad scale. In terms of colonisation and extinction processes the spatial structure of the species occupancy appeared to have a dominant role in driving the observed dynamics as well as again, climate change in terms of warming winter temperatures. Throughout this thesis, the above mentioned ecological responses were linked to species ecological traits with the aim of gaining a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning species’ differential responses to environmental change and identifying those trait groups that may be most vulnerable or most valuable as indicators. A significant group of characteristics that consistently appeared to be linked to species resilience to observed environmental pressures (particularly climate change) was phenological traits. Species with earlier laying dates and/or longer laying periods were associated with increasing population trends, larger colonisation rates and smaller extinction rates. Also analysis of species niches in relation to environmental pressures not only revealed the dynamic nature of niche parameters, confirming niche evolution and niche tracking in some species but also confirmed their relationship with both species characteristics and current conservation categories. Finally this study reiterated the fact that relationships between species characteristics and environmental pressures involve complex interactions that significantly affect and transform species responses to environmental pressures. For example the interaction between migratory behaviour and phenological traits (i. e. earlier laying dates and longer laying periods) meant that migrant species were less likely to have declining populations or that warming winter temperatures were associated with increased colonisation for migrants or species with more annual broods were less likely to show extinction in cells with temperature increase. All these results not only confirm the suitability of birds and particularly passerine species as indicators of environmental use and their potential and importance as part of <b>indices</b> and monitoring <b>programmes</b> but also highlights the importance of updating the next generation of indicators with measurements that can take into account important species characteristics associated with resilience to environmental pressures (i. e. phenological traits) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. School and {{learning}} readiness are continually being {{placed under the}} spotlight {{in an attempt to}} protect the grade 1 learner from possible learning failures, since unsuccessful learning experiences have negative effects even on a person's adult life. A factor that plays {{a significant role in the}} current teaching situation in the RSA is the fact that many grade 1 leamers are not instructed in their mother tongue and that they are not familiar with the concepts which are used in the language of learning and teaching. Another important factor is the fact that since 2004 learners may enrol as grade 1 learners at primary schools if they are five and a half years old and did not attend a grade R class. In this study the problems experienced by grade 1 leamers in primary schools since the implementation of Outcomes-based Education in the RSA in 1998, were determined by means of a pilot study. It was followed up by a literature study on the brain and factors that influence the working of the brain among young learners, as well as learning and factors that cannot only promote learning among this age group, but also disadvantage it. The literature was also consulted to look at stimulation of the child's development in the early development stage (0 - 9 years). As cross control for the study, the influence of the implementation of the RNCS was determined by means of a Likert-type questionnaire that was sent to grade 1 teachers. As a result of factors that were identified from the above-named literature study and from the information acquired from the pilot project and Likert-type questionnaire, a conceptual stimulation programme for multicultural grade 1 classes was developed to provide in the shortcomings that currently occur among grade 1 learners. The Aptitude Test for School beginners (ASB), a standarised school readiness test of the HSRC, was used as a measuring instrument to acquire a differentiated image in a scientific way of the grade 1 learners (n = 39) for the purpose of this study. Thereafter, the learners were divided into an experimental and a control group. The conceptual stimulation programme was presented to the experimental group for ten consecutive weeks. The AS 6 test was then conducted again with all the grade 1 learners involved. Both the first and final tests were marked according to the prescribed marking keys, interpreted according to the norm tables and statistically processed. The pre and post test scores of the two groups were compared and the experimental group improved in all 8 sections of the test battery, namely perception, spatial, reasoning, numerical, Gestalt, co-ordination, memory and verbal comprehension. In each of these categories there was an increase of d = 0. 5 and more which according to Cohen's d-values, can be regarded as practically meaningful. The above-mentioned results indicate that the effective presentation of a conceptual stimulation programme to a group of multicultural grade 1 learners provides positive results and that the didactical methods used during the presentation can be recommended to grade 1 teachers in the current multicultural schools in the RSA. The programme can serve as a prototype to adress the shortcomings identified in the practise (questionnaires) and the literature study.
