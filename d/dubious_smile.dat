6000|$|... "Hum!" [...] ejaculated Stanley, with a <b>dubious</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "you {{forgot to}} add--a youthful, robust frame, {{with the blood}} careering through the veins like wildfire, to your {{catalogue}} of requisites. No doubt it is pleasant enough in its way; but commend me to spring or autumn for thorough enjoyment, when the air is mild, and the waters flowing, and the woods green and beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|Master Heriot did {{not take}} the hint, but sat fast, with an embarrassed countenance however, like one who had {{something}} to say that he knew not exactly how to make effectual. At length he said, with a <b>dubious</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "You are fortunate, my lord, in having so soon dispatched your business at Court. Your talking landlady informs me you have been but a fortnight in this city. It is usually months and years ere the Court and a suitor shake hands and part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am happy, fair cousin," [...] {{said the}} King, {{with one of}} those <b>dubious</b> <b>smiles</b> of which he {{frequently}} made use, [...] "that your gracious pleasure has not fixed on my younger daughter, Joan. I should otherwise have had spear breaking between you and my cousin of Orleans; and, had harm come of it, I must on either side have lost a kind friend and affectionate cousin." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of approval, {{in one or}} two cases a little <b>dubious.</b> Dartrey <b>smiled</b> a {{greeting}} at Weavel.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} think he's showing us some {{consideration}} in not riding the beast down to the settlement," [...] Blake remarked with a <b>dubious</b> <b>smile,</b> feeling strongly annoyed with himself for not taking more precautions. With the cunning which the lust for drink breeds in its victims Benson had outwitted him by feigning acquiescence. [...] "Anyhow," [...] he added, [...] "I'll have to go after him. We must have the horse, for one thing, but I suppose we'll lose four days. This is rough on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Worthy Mrs Donnithorne's {{charities}} {{were always}} bestowed with such delicacy that she managed, in some mysterious way, {{to make the}} recipients {{feel as though they}} had done her a favour in accepting them. And yet she was not a soft piece of indiscriminating amiability, whose chief delight in giving lay in the sensations which the act created within her own breast. By no means. None knew better than she when and where to give money, and when to give blankets, bread, or tea. She was equally sharp to perceive the spirit that rendered it advisable for her to say, [...] "I want you to do me a favour--there's a good woman now, you won't refuse me, etcetera," [...] and to detect the spirit that called forth the sharp remark, accompanied with a <b>dubious</b> <b>smile</b> and a shake of her fat forefinger, [...] "There now, see that you make better use of it this time, else I shall have to scold you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{hope and}} fear, confined to this one channel, made each day in her presence a delicious torment. There was one deliberate act of hers which especially helped to intoxicate me. When we were at Vienna her twentieth birthday occurred, and as she was very fond of ornaments, we all took the opportunity of the splendid jewellers' shops in that Teutonic Paris to purchase her a birthday present of jewellery. Mine, naturally, was the least expensive; it was an opal ring--the opal was my favourite stone, {{because it seems to}} blush and turn pale as if it had a soul. I told Bertha so when I gave it her, and said that it was an emblem of the poetic nature, changing with the changing light of heaven and of woman's eyes. In the evening she appeared elegantly dressed, and wearing conspicuously all the birthday presents except mine. I looked eagerly at her fingers, but saw no opal. I had no opportunity of noticing this to her during the evening; but the next day, when I found her seated near the window alone, after breakfast, I said, [...] "You scorn to wear my poor opal. I should have remembered that you despised poetic natures, and should have given you coral, or turquoise, or some other opaque unresponsive stone." [...] "Do I despise it?" [...] she answered, taking hold of a delicate gold chain which she always wore round her neck and drawing out the end from her bosom with my ring hanging to it; [...] "it hurts me a little, I can tell you," [...] she said, with her usual <b>dubious</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "to wear it in that secret place; and since your poetical nature is so stupid as to prefer a more public position, I shall not endure the pain any longer." ...|$|E
