25|$|The {{octagonal}} pavilion supports an {{arched roof}} that is, in turn, surmounted by a clerestory and dome. The clerestory {{is supported by}} eight free-standing, wood-clad, cast-iron columns located within the rotunda and grouped in pairs. Projecting from the pavilion roof on the east, west, and south elevations are dormer windows with peak roofs. Between major arched structural <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> are wood muntins that hold the glass lights on their sides. The lights lap one over one another like shingles and follow {{the curve of the}} arches.|$|E
25|$|Conservatories {{were popular}} {{throughout}} California’s early history. Structures of various {{shapes and sizes}} were built in Victorian California, ranging from an attached and glassed-in wing for a residence, to a great domed or compartmentalized, detached glasshouse. Examples of wealthy Californians who built conservatories in their private estates include: A.K.P. (Albion Keith Paris) Harmon, for his Oakland Lake Merritt Estate (which later became Lakeside Park); Frederick Delger; Frank M. Smith; Darius Ogden Mills (Millbrae); and Luther Burbank, for his own experiments with plant germination (Santa Rosa). This is not surprising, as agriculture was fast becoming {{an important part of}} the state’s economy and horticulture an important aspect of the gentleman’s education. In each of these cases, wood was substituted for metal as the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> This posed special challenges for the ongoing maintenance and repair of the greenhouses in the long term.|$|E

50|$|The display {{consists}} of an LED display apparatus including multiple LED display modules, an inner <b>frame</b> <b>member,</b> and a supporting unit. The LED display module has an array of light emitting diodes mounted thereon, and a longitudinal axis. The inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> is disposed to confine the LED display module therein, and has a size sufficient to permit movement of the LED display module in opposite directions of the longitudinal axis. The supporting unit mounts the LED display module in the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> such that the LED display module is movable {{back and forth in}} the inner <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> along the longitudinal axis. As the drum spins, the system controls the lighting of each pixel at a precise location to produce a visible image.|$|R

40|$|A {{deployable}} {{table is}} presented. The table is stowed in and deployed from a storage compartment {{based upon a}} non-self rigidizing, 4 -hinge, arch support structure that folds upon itself to stow and that expands to deploy. The work surfaces bypass each other above and below to allow the deployment mechanism to operate.

50|$|Resistance to {{lateral forces}} is {{provided}} primarily by rigid frame action - that is, {{by the development}} of bending moment and shear force in the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> and joints. By virtue of the rigid beam-column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection. The bending rigidity and strength of the <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to simulate the mechanical behavior of RC−Frames with masonry infills. In this paper, selected modeling techniques for masonry infills and reinforced concrete <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> will be discussed − stressing the attention on the damaging effects of the individual members and the entire system under quasi−static horizontal loading. The effect of the infill walls on the surrounding <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is studied using equivalent strut elements. The implemented model consider in−plane failure modes for the infills, such as bed joint sliding and corner crushing. These <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> models differ {{with respect to their}} stress state. Finally, examples are provided and compared with experimental data from a real size test executed on a three story RC−Frame with and without infills. The quality of the model is evaluated on the basis of load−displacement relationships as well as damage progression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{nonlinear}} hardening {{rule that}} describes a general yield surface change for <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is proposed. The rule is valid for homogeneous materials and {{is defined by}} a nonlinear constitutive model. The model is given as the stress–strain relationship through the section thickness. The post-yield behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is assessed using a hardening index parameter, a plastic strain coefficient, and a smooth and optimal mathematical function to model the geometry of structural wide-flange and tube sections. This enables a continuous distribution of post-yield curvatures to exist along the member length and results in accurate finite-element member displacement predictions. Steady-state hysteresis responses are determined for frame sections using the model’s nonlinearly degrading stiffness. The hardening rule is used to model the detailed material behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> that are subjected to lateral loads. The results of the model are validated through experimental published literature...|$|R

Typically a <b>frame</b> <b>member</b> will be between 25mm to 50mm in width, depending upon the application and the desired appearance of the cabinet. For built in cabinets, it is common for stiles that are to abut a wall to be cut wider than the final size so that these may be scribed to the shape of the wall. This compensates for out of plumb or uneven walls, which are common in many houses.|$|R

30|$|Generated plastic hinges is {{indicated}} in Fig.  19. As {{shown in this}} figure, the off-diagonal system has {{the highest level of}} deformation not only in RC <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> but also in steel members, especially in third member of steel ODBS. The rotational capacity is increased in ODBS, the most ductile system. Performance levels of flexural and X-braced frames are limited to Life Safety (LS) level, but for ODBS, level of performance has been extended to higher ductility about related design criteria. Six and fifteen stories flexural frames have plastic hinges more than X-braced frame. On the other hand in ODBS, more members are contributed in absorption of defined existing energy by nonlinear ductile behavior of plastic rotation and deformation proportional to flexural frame. Non-linear static analyses as well as dynamic step by step seismic analyses are performed and special purpose elements are employed for the needs of this study.

50|$|There {{are several}} major {{issues that are}} at risk from a chimney fire event. There is of course the danger of burning debris being {{expelled}} {{from the top of}} the chimney that could ignite other portions of the structure, but the major cause of damage is where the heat of the chimney fire will pass through the masonry materials and overheat nearby combustibles. Even though codes and standards require a specific clearance of the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> from the masonry materials, often this is not found in actual construction. Many fires reported as chimney fires, are actually structure fires ignited by the overheating of the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> These structure fires can be traced to the normal use of the fireplace or sealed combustion chamber.|$|E
