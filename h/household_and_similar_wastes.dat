40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the state-of-play of incineration and other waste management options for different wastes in the EU, provides {{an assessment of}} proven and emerging techniques for increased energy recovery in waste-to-energy processes and concludes with an outlook of possible evolutions in the EU's waste-to-energy landscape. An analysis of statistical data from Eurostat, enhanced with input from various industrial federations, revealed that merely six types of wastes {{are responsible for the}} lion's share of energy embedded in all the waste currently sent to incineration and/or landfill. They include in particular <b>household</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>waste</b> as well as sorting residues, which jointly account for nearly four fifths of the energy contained in all landfilled waste, and which together with wood waste comprise almost two thirds of the energy contained in all waste sent for incineration. Techniques for improving energy recovery were discussed for each of the five main categories of waste-to-energy processes: combustion plants, waste incineration plants, cement and lime kilns, anaerobic digestion plants and others. Figures from 2013 / 2014 showed that the three middle categories accounted together for an estimated total of 676 PJ annual mixed energy outputs from waste. Using the technical options available today, and without taking into account any possible changes to the types and amounts of waste currently sent for energy recovery, this value could be increased by more than a quarter. However, future developments in waste generation and waste management may possibly lead to an increase of energy recovery by incineration for <b>household</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>waste</b> as well as for sorting residues, an increase in energy recovery by anaerobic digestion for animal and vegetal wastes and a decrease of the amounts sent for energy recovery for several other wastes, including source separated wastes such as wood waste.

40|$|The {{recycling}} <b>and</b> {{recovery of}} <b>Household</b> <b>and</b> <b>Similar</b> <b>Waste</b> (HSW) represents a real {{potential in the}} Kingdom of Morocco. The quantity generated is important with a significant annual growth of 0. 75 Kg/person/day with a total quantity generated in 2013 around 5. 377. 000 t. Therefore, Morocco is facing a real challenge to deal environmental problems. In the present study, an integrated approach has been proposed and validated on real conditions. This approach aims to develop both Alternative Green Fuel (EAF) and high-quality compost. This study {{is based on a}} qualitative and quantitative analysis of HSW carried out on two appropriate characterization campaigns to selected Moroccan landfills. The fraction of alternative fuel (AF) with a considerable calorific power represents 38 % of the HSW, while the Fermentable Fraction (FF) is approximately 59 % of the total amount of HSW. Experimental analysis has been done to determine Lower Calorific Power (LCP) as well as gas emission fractions which showed an LCP of 27 MJ/kg and the presence of antimony and Chloride. The study realized in laboratory on AF shows that these hazardous elements (Sb & Cl) were present mainly in PET, PVC, textile and HDPE (Hight density polyethelene) with content very high than international norms. Therefore it was necessary to remove the aforementioned fraction from AF to provide an eco-friendly combustible with a LCP of 21 MJ/kg and a percentage of 22 % of HSW.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{environmental}} performance of current European waste management is a challenging, yet crucial task towards a more sustainable Europe. New approaches are therefore {{needed to provide}} an effective and science-based support to environmentally sound decision-making in waste management. These approaches {{should be able to}} complement existing insights and adapt to the increasing complexity of the current waste management systems. As widely recognized by EU legislation, Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) is a viable approach to support sound waste management choices. In this context, the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) has lead the development of macro-level, life cycle based waste management indicators to quantify and monitor the potential environmental impacts, benefits, and improvements associated with the management of a number of selected waste streams generated and treated in Europe. The waste management indicators consistently complement and support article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive (EC, 2008), according to which any deviation from the waste hierarchy (prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery, and disposal) must be justified by “life cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste”. They provide a basis to monitor the progress made with the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive and national policies in relation to reducing the environmental impacts associated with waste and increasing the benefits of waste management strategies. The waste management indicators developed make use of a combination of macro statistical waste management data combined with emissions/resource life cycle data for the different elements of the waste treatment chain. Indicators were initially calculated for the entire European Union (EU- 27) and for Germany. The following waste streams were considered: <b>household</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>waste,</b> paper <b>and</b> cardboard, plastic, glass, metals, wood, animal and vegetal waste, and mineral waste. Overall, 11 impact categories were included in the assessment, i. e. climate change, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, ionising radiation, ozone depletion, particulate matter/respiratory inorganics, photochemical ozone formation, ecotoxicity, land use and resource depletion. An indicator developed for a given waste stream captures the potential environmental impact associated with the generation and management of that waste stream. The entire waste management chain is considered, i. e. from generation to final treatment/disposal. Therefore, system boundaries for the selected waste streams include also the treatment or recycling of secondary waste (e. g. bottom ash from the incineration of <b>household</b> waste), <b>and</b> secondary products (e. g. recovered paper), as well as energy recovery. The experiences from the development of these life cycle based waste management indicators suggest that more detailed and quality-assured waste statistics are needed, especially covering the many different treatment operations and options. Also, it would be beneficial if waste statistics had a higher disaggregation level of waste categories, as well as more detailed information about waste composition. A further development of the indicators should include an increased number of waste streams, as well as calculation of the results for all Member States. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} and experimental {{research on the}} evaluation of the technological aspects of the post-closure activity of the municipal solid waste landfills presented in this study constitutes an attempt to describe, by means of a detailed analysis, the relations of interdependence that exist between the management operations and the aspects having {{a significant impact on the}} environment in the municipal solid waste landfills areas. The results obtained by means of {{theoretical and}} experimental investigation lead us to the following conclusions: A. Concerning the timeliness of the topic/theme In base of studying specialised literature on waste, it can be stated that: - The waste quantity generated has an upward trend. The necessary options to reduce the amount of generated waste refer to [57, 80]: • reduction at source; • reducing the amount of waste streams; • waste valorisation: reuse, recycling and energy recovery; • waste disposal. - Municipal Solid <b>Waste</b> consists of <b>household</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>waste</b> collected by or on behalf of the municipal authorities. The structure of the municipal solid waste is composed of the following fractions [60, 62]: • paper, cardboard and paper products; • plastic materials; • glass; • metals; • food waste; • garden waste and textiles. - The modalities of waste collection are [98, 99, 111]: • traditional door to door collection; • differentiated collection by fractions for recovery operations. - Landfills present a number of factors which should be studied carefully in order to monitor the manufactured products, which can have a significant impact on the environment and can have harmful effects on the environment or on the population. - The sources of the environmental pollution are: • soil pollution (by disposing waste on the soil); • water pollution (by waterproofing systems and by the leachate collection; • air pollution (by the biogas collection system). - By implementing management systems and adequate monitoring, new jobs can be created - to perform different activities specific to landfills. - Large amounts of material can be recycled, especially non-hazardous materials. B. Aspects regarding the theoretical foundation of technological aspects of the post-closure activity of the landfills for municipal solid waste 1. From a legislative point of view, there are European regulations and norms that the operators and landfills managers must obey. Both Italy and Romania have their own legislation whose implementation is mandatory to ensure the landfill adequate operation. 2. Each landfill is specific to the category of waste that can be accepted for storage. The waste to be deposited in landfills can be classified into three categories [99]: - residential waste; - commercial waste; - industrial waste. 3. The properties of the analysed waste in the research can be classified as follows [24, 99]: - physical properties of waste: • waste moisture; • waste granulometry; • waste density; • waste permeability; • waste temperature; - chemical properties of waste; - biological properties of waste. 4. According to the type of waste deposited in the landfill, landfills can be classified into three categories [55 - 57, 99]: - landfills for inert waste; - landfills for non-hazardous waste: • landfills for inorganic waste; • landfills for organic waste: o landfills - bio-reactor; o landfills for pre-treated waste. • landfills for waste mixture; - landfills for hazardous waste. 5. The life cycle of the landfill is divided into four clearly defined stages (design and construction, active management, closure and passive management), but in the theoretical and experimental analysis, the active period (in which waste is deposited in the landfill) and the post-closure phase (minimum of 30 years after the landfill has been covered by vegetation) are considere...|$|R
