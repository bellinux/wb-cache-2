50|$|Since most {{professional}} baseball games are nine innings long, the <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> {{is used as}} the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, {{the end of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> then 4½ innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores {{to take the lead in}} the bottom of the <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth.|$|R
