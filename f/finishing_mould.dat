5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the <b>finished</b> <b>moulded</b> product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|R

40|$|When {{manufacturing}} mould {{tools to}} produce high quality components, additional operations such as grinding, honing and lapping are often required. These additional operations produce an appropriate <b>finish</b> for <b>moulding</b> {{the high quality}} component. Surface finishes generated from the machining stages often have cusps and rises that are detrimental to the product finish which has a direct relation to the finish of the tool. The surface finish can be produced {{in a number of}} ways and be influenced by external sources [1] as seen in research previously. If the surface <b>finish</b> of the <b>mould</b> tool could be generated without the need for additional operations then a time and cost saving could be achieved. 2. Why? For several years now the country has seen a decline in the manufacture and production of plastic parts due to the lack of UK companies being competitive. The lack of competitive edge in the SME sector has lead to the smaller companies looking at reducing time to produce full production mould tools, therefore allowing them to become competitive on a global scale. Several institutions around the globe have identified these issues and have looked at alternatives such as material change [2] or the development of rapid components. These however have not been readily accepted by industr...|$|R

40|$|Micro milling is an {{economically}} interesting process for manufacturin ~ of rwzc injection moulds for small and medium batches. In contrast to other mal-processes, like the LIGA-technique, it allows real 3 -dimensional piece s";ruc"lu;es. However, moulds obtained by micro milling of hardened steels often show burrs {{that have to}} be removed. Additionally, the typical surface textures due to the milling process can obstruct demoulding. Micro peening with abrasive blasting agents allows deburring and removing of the surface textures due to the milling process. Edge rounding can be almost avoided using appropriate peening parameters and the use of appropriate blasting agents. Micro peening with non-abrasive blasting agents such as glass or ceramic beads allows a removal of surface textures by plastic deformation. Surface roughness can be significantly reduced by levelling of profile peaks. In the work presented here the influence of the micro peening process on micro milled structures was studied for different blasting agents in difierent single-step and double-step processes. This included the investigation of deburring effect, edge rounding and the influence on the surface topography.

The investigations of machining parameters (e. g. pressure, revolutions, feed rate) as well as path related parameters (e. g. trochoid radii, offsets) lead to an optimal process strategy.

Grinding realises Ra = 0. 3 micrometer and Rt = 4 micrometer. After lapping the matte surface exhibits Ra = 0. 15 micrometer and Rt = 2 micrometer. The final surface quality is based on Ra = 5 nm and Rt = 55 nm revealing a defect-free mirror finish.

60|$|Whether Sir Felix, her son, {{had become}} {{what he was}} solely by bad training, or whether {{he had been born}} bad, who shall say? It is hardly {{possible}} that he should not have been better had he been taken away as an infant and subjected to moral training by moral teachers. And yet again it is hardly possible that any training or want of training should have produced a heart so utterly incapable of feeling for others as was his. He could not even feel his own misfortunes unless they touched the outward comforts of the moment. It seemed that he lacked sufficient imagination to realise future misery though the futurity to be considered was divided from the present but by a single month, a single week,--but by a single night. He liked to be kindly treated, to be praised and petted, to be well fed and caressed; and they who so treated him were his chosen friends. He had in this the instincts of a horse, not approaching the higher sympathies of a dog. But it cannot be said of him that he had ever loved any one to the extent of denying himself a moment's gratification on that loved one's behalf. His heart was a stone. But he was beautiful to lock at, ready-witted, and intelligent. He was very dark, with that soft olive complexion which so generally gives to young men an appearance of aristocratic breeding. His hair, which was never allowed to become long, was nearly black, and was soft and silky without that taint of grease which is so common with silken-headed darlings. His eyes were long, brown in colour, and were made beautiful by the perfect arch of the perfect eyebrow. But perhaps the glory of the face was due more to the <b>finished</b> <b>moulding</b> and fine symmetry of the nose and mouth than to his other features. On his short upper lip he had a moustache as well formed as his eyebrows, but he wore no other beard. The form of his chin too was perfect, but it lacked that sweetness and softness of expression, indicative of softness of heart, which a dimple conveys. He was about five feet nine in height, and was as excellent in figure as in face. It was admitted by men and clamorously asserted by women that no man had ever been more handsome than Felix Carbury, and it was admitted also that he never showed consciousness of his beauty. He had given himself airs on many scores;--on the score of his money, poor fool, while it lasted; on the score of his title; on the score of his army standing till he lost it; and especially on the score of superiority in fashionable intellect. But he had been clever enough to dress himself always with simplicity and to avoid the appearance of thought about his outward man. As yet the little world of his associates had hardly found out how callous were his affections,--or rather how devoid he was of affection. His airs and his appearance, joined with some cleverness, had carried him through even the viciousness of his life. In one matter he had marred his name, and by a moment's weakness had injured his character among his friends more than he had done by the folly of three years. There had been a quarrel between him and a brother officer, in which he had been the aggressor; and, when the moment came in which a man's heart should have produced manly conduct, he had first threatened and had then shown the white feather. That was now a year since, and he had partly outlived the evil;--but some men still remembered that Felix Carbury had been cowed, and had cowered.|$|R

Some products require several thousands of pressed moulds and fitting moulds to manufacture different parts of <b>finished</b> goods. Hence, <b>moulds</b> significantly affect the quality of finished goods. The process of manufacturing moulds is complicated and time-consuming and requires the investment of capital in items such as specific machines, staff training, time, etc. Due to the shorter lead times that are being demanded by customers, mould manufacturers are finding ways to reduce their production time.

It was {{published}} in the journal, Plastics, rubber and composites : macromolecular engineering [© Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining] and is also available at: [URL] polyurethane (PU) foam moulding process involves the use of sacrificial release agents (SRAs) that are both costly and harmful to the environment. This research proposes the use of low surface energy, polymer substrates, as a means of eliminating SRAs from the foam moulding process. Previous work identified the major factors affecting the ability of a polymer surface to release a PU foam part as being the surface energy and surface roughness of the substrate, and the proportion of isocyanate in the foam. The research described here has built upon these results and quantified the effects of each factor by using a D optimal design of experiment structure. Crucially it has also been shown that, given the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not unaided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This capability will provide the PU foam moulding industry with the possibility of identifying polymeric mould materials, and levels of <b>finishing</b> for these <b>moulds,</b> which have the potential to allow the elimination of SRAs from the production process...|$|R
40|$|The metal {{injection}} moulding technique is already established for serial production of complex parts, mostly from various stainless steels. However, for other materials, especially for titanium parts {{there is still the}} need for superior purity and enhanced surface quality. Facing the challenge of obtaining suitable medical titanium MIM parts, advances have been made at Fraunhofer IFAM over the last few years. One strategy to overcome the high risk of carbon up-take was to adjust the sintering program. Very low Argon flow rates, 50 mbar pressure and two hours dwell time at 1350 °C were found to be optimal parameters. A cleaning cycle prior to the actual sintering at 1450 °C under hydrogen was also found to enhance the results. Another strategy involved the choice of binder components. Stearic acid, which is often used to improve wettability of binder to powder particle, and high polymer content affect the oxygen content of the titanium parts. Low amounts of both are beneficial for high purity parts. Other investigations were performed concerning the surface quality. It was found that the surface roughness of the mould has an effect on the surface roughness of the sintered parts. Although sintered titanium surfaces as such exhibit quite rough surfaces of about 2 - 3 µm (Ra value) the influence of the surface <b>finish</b> of the <b>mould</b> was detectable.

40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} is {{a process}} {{with a range of}} unique benefits, currently experiencing significant growth within industry. A primary limitation of the process, however, is the restricted range of suitable materials and the subsequent limitations placed upon the mechanical performance of rotationally moulded products. The aim of this research project was to develop a rotational moulding material which possessed substantially improved mechanical properties over conventional, rotationally moulded polyethylene grades. This was attempted through the development of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite which was amenable to the rotational moulding process. Although the development of rotationally moulded composites has been previously reported in literature, these materials have largely proven to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanical performance. The composite material developed here is distinct from those previously reported in that it utilises melt-compounded composite granules of a significantly larger size than are normally considered suitable for rotational moulding. These granules are intended to be moulded as an inner layer within a rotationally moulded product, with the outer moulded layer formed from conventional, unfilled polymer powder. In this way, the average length of the fibres within the moulded article is maximised while retaining the benefits of the melt-compounding process and giving an excellent external <b>moulded</b> <b>finish.</b> In order to achieve a sufficient degree of composite granule flow and coalescence during rotational moulding, it was found necessary to base the composite granules on high melt-flow, injection moulding grades of polypropylene and polyethylene.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn recent years the use of polymers has become increasingly significant in almost all areas of industry. Polyurethanes in particular can be produced in an extremely large range of formulations, and {{with a wide range}} of properties. The research carried out here was based on polyurethane foams used within the automotive industry for seating and insulation. One of the biggest problems facing the manufacturers of polyurethane foam is that of releasing a part from its mould without causing damage to either the part or the mould itself. Traditional methods of manufacture involve the use of a steel or aluminium mould, coated with a sacrificial, normally wax-based, release agent in order to allow effective part removal. Various environmental and financial issues are associated with the use of these release agents, and this research, therefore, aimed to provide an alternative to their use. Many companies use moulds manufactured from polymeric materials for short run production, and occasionally it has been observed that in certain cases a PU foam part can be released without using a sacrificial release agent. However, the issue of predicting release of PU foam from a polymer mould is something of a 'black art', and in most cases a company will continue to use a sacrificial release agent in order to prevent any possibility of parts sticking in the mould. The author of this work has shown that the low surface energy of a polymer allows un-aided polyurethane foam release under certain conditions. It has also been shown that, contrary to a large school of thought, the roughness of the substrate had a large effect on the ability of a polymer surface to release. The foam composition was also significant. Crucially it has been shown that, given the input of the surface energy of a polymer substrate, its roughness and the composition of the foam, it is possible to predict whether or not un-aided release should be possible, and a model has been produced in order to allow this prediction for the foams under consideration. This model will provide a company with the ability to identify possible polymeric mould materials, and levels of <b>finishing</b> for these <b>moulds,</b> which have the potential to allow un-aided release of polyurethane parts...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{composite}} manufacturing process that would be able to deliver Class A surface finished products in the context of mould manufacturing methods. The problem required solving was to overcome the time needed to prepare Class A surfaces, by developing a composite manufacturing process that will deliver Class A surface finished products straight from the mould. The process was aimed at the entire development process, from mould and plug design up to the finished product. A literature study and a factory mould survey were conducted with a view to obtain the necessary insights into surface finishing and composite manufacturing. These surveys were followed by seven constructional tests which determined the most appropriate solutions for the proposed manufacturing processes. Test 1 was used to determine a quality finish standard for composites from the sanding grits used to finished composite surfaces versus surface roughness values used in other industries. The standard determined that a P 800 finish has a roughness between 0. 200 and 0. 150 um and constitutes a Class A 3 finish. P 1000 to P 1200 have a roughness between 0. 150 um to 0. 100 um and constitutes a Class A 2 finish. Finally a P 2000 and higher have a roughness of 0. 100 um and lower and constitutes Class A 1 surface finish. After the standard was set, the tests for <b>finishing</b> of the <b>moulds,</b> plugs and parts commenced. Test 2 was conducted on the CNC manufacturing of plugs out of Nuceron 651 tooling board. Tool path parameters were varied in a matrix. The samples with the best surface finish value were cut with a step-over of 0. 5 and feed of 800 mm/min. These parameters were found to be the most influential. Test 2 and 4 revealed that the plug surface finishing should commence with conventional 2 K paint finishing, with a possibility of acrylic split surface. This process produced projected mould surfaces between 0. 150 um and 0. 200 um, which can be categorised as Class A- 3. Test 5 and 6 determined methods for improving the mould surface quality and durability. It was established that the tooling gelcoat should be applied whilst being heated and backed with at least two layers of glass veil and a steady increase of GSM of structural glass fibres to prevent print-through. Test 3 determined that the mould corners could be strengthened with rovings pressed into the corner. It was also established that the moulds surfaces will require finishing after demoulding. The final moulds were manufactured from a fibreglass composite structure with tooling gelcoat surface. A number of guidelines and a set process were developed in order to produce moulds with a surface finish of average 0. 9 um, equivalent to Class A 1. Release agents were tested in Test 7, and the Loctite Frekote 770 -NC release system was deemed appropriate for use with In Mould Coating (IMC) of 2 K Paint. These elements were all synthesised into plug, mould and part manufacturing processes. The proposed processes were validated by the manufacturing of a JS instrument panel, which delivered a Class A 2, 0. 175 um, finish with IMC of 2 K paint. With only a minor sanding of P 3000 grit and polishing, the part was made into a Class A 1 surface, measured at 0. 63 um. The study proved that it is possible to produce Class A finished part with IMC. This method can provide a solution aimed at the elimination of P 600 and lower finishing of composite parts manufactured with IMC. Master...|$|R
40|$|MAGNETIC {{bearings}} {{for large}} diameters and low rotational speeds are rarely developed and utilized due to poor competitive ability. They require little maintenance and offer high reliability, but until now mechanical bearings have outperformed them for slow rotating applications, only high speed applications {{have been able}} to justify the cost. With NdFeB magnets the quality of magnets has gone up and the cost down, making a new niche possible; large diameter ring bearings which can reduce the price and weight of the hub and bearing construction /: I (see chapter I). 	A literature study has been conducted to identify promising bearing technologies. One permanent magnet bearing, the PASF bearing, and one heteropolar self regulating electrodynamic bearing, the null flux bearing, were selected for further investigation /:II. PASF bearings are passive permanent magnet (PM) bearings employing change of magnetic reluctance to create force :/III. A. SLC is defined by Khoo et al. as the ratio between the maximum achievable force and the total self-weight of a magnetic bearing [4]. They claim PASF bearings can achieve a SLC up to 450 : 1, ten times higher than conventional repulsive bearings. With this in mind, we have tried to make a simple PASF bearing with better performance than the RPMB described in [19]. The bearings have been modelled in COMSOL and further evaluated in MATLAB /:VI. Results from the PASF computations showed an axial force shape of the PASF bearing very {{different from that of the}} RPMB. The axial force curve is steep in axial direction close to the center position:/ III. C. Axial force increases with radial displacement, as opposed to the RPMB. Stabilizing the PASF bearing might be difficult due to high radial stiffness /:VII. B. Axial PASF bearings work in both axial directions without tradeoffs between force and stiffness or concern of touching. It can be constructed to utilize the magnets in a range of the magnetization curve where they work at the maximum energy product [24] and where the risk of permanent demagnetization is minimal :/ III. C. 	Null flux coils are used in Maglev trains [1][2][3][13], and have also been utilized in flywheel bearings [5]. When they are situated in a desired centre position the sum of magnetic flux through the closed coil loop will be zero, and the coil will neither exert force nor consume power. When displaced from this position there will be a net flux passing through the coil. Moving the coil gives an alternating flux which will induce currents, giving a restoring force /:IV. A. Hence, null flux bearings require speed to function. 	Forces were calculated based on equations for induced currents and forces on currents in magnetic fields, as is also done in [5] and [1]/:IV. B. Two different drag force equations were found using two different methods. Identifying the right equation will later be done by measurements. Axial forces are proportional to axial displacement, while drag forces are proportional to the square of axial displacement. As a result of a trade off between induced current amplitude and coinciding current and magnetic flux density, maximum force occurs when the impedance angle is 45 degrees. The bearing initially suggested, which is to be built, will only produce 5 % of its own weight when displaced 2 mm/:IV. D. Connecting a given inductance in series with the existing ones increases the force to 77 % of the rotor weight. Speed also influences the performance of the bearing. 	The term unloader has been introduced by Lembke [18]. In theory this bearing gives a constant force and no stiffness, hence it does not contribute to bearing stability /:VII. A. It would be very practical in applications exposed to constant forces such as gravity. Calculations performed indicate that theory does not correspond to reality in our case :/V. Further investigation is of interest, but has not been carried out in this project. Earnshaws theorem [16] constitutes the basis for magnetic bearing stability theory. The consequence of the physics described in the theorem is that there is no method of stabilizing a fully levitated bearing with only permanent magnets /:VII. However, there are ways of stabilizing permanent magnet bearings. Combinations of a mechanical bearing, electromagnetic bearing, diamagnetic bearing or electrodynamic bearing and a permanent magnet bearing is not covered by the theorem. Stiffness is the change in force with respect to position. The sum of the bearing stiffnesses in all dimensions must be positive for a bearing to be stable/:VII. A. Earnshaw claims this is not possible for magnetic dipoles, and that the sum will always be zero. Our calculations neither confirmed, nor invalidated this allegation/:VII. B. A null flux bearing can contribute with a positive stiffness, making the sum positive. 	For measurement and verification purposes, two test jigs were planned and nearly completed /:VIII. The test jigs were constructed to allow axial force measurements with radial and axial displacement for both bearing types /:IX. AError! Reference source not found [...] Rotor and stator for both the PASF and null flux bearing were to be made of reinforced epoxy cast from the same moulds. This way the construction would be very strong, and changes in bearing design would be easy to implement in new casts:/ 0. Several aspects of the building process were expected to involve difficulties. Magnet mounting turned out to be easier than suspected. Two of the main challenges when moulding epoxy is air bubbles and releasing the cast from the mould. Air bubbles were practically avoided, but releasing the cast resulted in a broken mould, terminating the building process and postponing the measurements for the time being. 	A lot of work is still to be done. <b>Finishing</b> the <b>moulding</b> and assembling and performing the planned measurements are first in line. Further calculations on PASF bearings may include increasing the number of fingers and including back iron in the middle PASF finger. For the null flux bearing, varying the impedance of the coils by serial connecting inductances could improve the performance significantly. Investigating the dynamics of the null flux bearing is essential for further work on the bearing. Finally, combining a weak repulsive bearing with a null flux bearing to realise complete levitation might be feasible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Vitaprint methods description. We {{currently}} {{describe the}} methods for two printable structure categories: Scaffolds Gelatin microfluidics Scaffold building Introduction The basic structures, {{often found in}} 3 D bioprinting literature are so called "woodpile" structures or scaffolds. Basically, this is a 3 D grid, which allows the cultivation of cells in the vertical direction and simultaneously sufficient perfusion with nutrient medium. Thus they are very useful for testing the cultivability of various cell types, however, due to their simple geometry, they are not suitable for very complex tissue structures, as these require more sophisticated design. The scaffolds are printed from various materials which are developed by the researchers themselves. However, as the geometry typically remains the same, it is also useful for evaluating material behaviour during and post printing, under cell-culture conditions, etc. We have prepared a simple python-based algorithm to simplify the generation of g-code of woodpile scaffolds, which you will also find in the repository. Table of Contents Workflow General materials and tools Gelatin-alginate Specific materials Preparation of the composite Print settings and conditions Important guidelines Post-processing Gluten Specific materials Preparation of the material Print settings and conditions Post-processing Workflow General materials and tools distilled water glass beakers magnetic stirrer + rods microwave oven 5 ml syringes blunt-end gauge needles (G 21 or G 27) Vitaprint extruder mounted on a CNC system Printing materials Here we describe the preparation of two scaffold materials: A gelatin-alginate composite for tissue engineering Gluten - a highly viscous material and a very affordable adhesive component Gelatin-alginate Gelatin is a the thermal degradation product of collagen and is typically obtained by cooking animal connective tissues, of which collagen is the main component. Due to its origin, gelatin can mimick {{the composition of the}} average extracellular matrix well. It exhibits thermal gelation, thus a hydrogel made from gelatin can be used for manufacturing by heating (melting) and cooling (gelation). This is very handy for printing, however, the material itself is not stable at cell culture conditions (37 °C) and will require post-processing by additional cross-linking when used for this purpose. This can be achieved by different approaches, either by using gultaraldehyde (very toxic, requires rigorous rinsing), transglutaminases, N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N′-ethylcarbodiimide, etc. Alginate is a polysaccharide found in brown algae and exhibits ionic cross-linking by interacting with calcium ions while in solution. When blended together with gelatin it gives mechanical stability to the structure when cross-linked. The polymer chains are however loosened significantly when in a natrium ion rich medium, which is common for cell-culture media. Specific materials Gelatin from porcine skin (Sigma-Aldrich) Sodium alginate (Sigma-Aldrich) Calcium Chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) Preparation of the composite The printing material is composed of a 10 % gelatin (w/w) and 1 % alginate (w/w) in water and is prepared in the following manner for 20 ml of printing material: 18. 8 ml of water are transferred to a beaker and rigorously mixed on a magnetic stirrer. Very slowly and carefully, 0. 2 g of alginate are added to avoid the formation of lumps. 2 g of gelatin are added in the same manner and the mix is stirred for additional 5 - 10 min for the gelatin to soak in the solution. The mixture is heated in a microwave and the heating is stopped immediately after the boiling point is reached. The mixture is stirred for one more minute. The beaker is placed in a vacuum desiccator to remove bubbles from the solution. The solution is loaded into a 5 ml syringe and mounted on the preheated extruder where it is let to reach printing temperature (at least 30 min). Print settings and conditions The settings for printing vary slightly, depending on the nozzle. Print settings for blunt-end G 21 and G 27 needles are shown in the table below and were determined experimentally at 20 - 22 °C ambient temperature and for printed structures with a layer height equal to the nozzle diameter. nozzle F [mm/min] E [mm/ 10 mm of path] T [°C] G 21 (0. 4 mm ID) 100 - 400 0. 04 27 - 29 G 27 (0. 2 mm ID) 100 - 400 0. 01 28 - 29 Once the settings are adjusted, the g-code can be generated and run via CNC controller. We use PlanetCNC USB controller ([URL] as it allows extensive manual control. It {{is important to note that}} the user should be well versed in using his CNC system. Important guidelines Before printing, decide on the surface/container where the print should take place (e. g. petri dish). After mounting the syringe and the nozzle, determine the (x,y,z) = (0, 0, 0) position. The z position is especially important and should lie approximately 1 layer height above the surface. Before running the g-code, enough material should be extruded from the syringe to reach the tip of the nozzle. This can be done manually, but we recomment it be pre-programmed in the g-code by adding skirts. Post-processing After printing the scaffolds are transferred to a 10 mM CaCl₂ solution to cross-link the alginate. In this manner they become stable during heating and when soaked into sterilization liquids (e. g. 70 % alcohol). Figure 1 : Simple gelatin-alginate woodpile scaffold, generated using the python g-code generator. Figure 2 : Nose scaffold from the gelatin-alginate composite. G-code generated using attached Slic 3 r settings. Gluten Gluten is a protein often found in cereal grains, especially wheat and is a common waste product in food production. Though there is more (food related) discussion about this material now, it has been known for centuries and was traditionally used as a glue. It is not only a good adhesive, but also its mechanical properties can be adjusted by modifying the polymer chains, making it either soft and elastic, or stiff as glass. Therefore it may become a very interesting component for digital manufacturing. Specific materials gluten (Buxtrade GmbH) citric acid (optional, for modifying viscosity) Preparation of the material 5. 5 g of gluten granules are soaked in 4. 5 ml of water overnight (or for at least 6 hours). The soaked material is heated to 60 °C in a water bath and stirred until smooth. The gluten solution is loaded into the syringe and mounted onto the extruder, which is preheated to 50 °C and let to reach printing temperature (at least 30 min). Print settings and conditions Being extremely viscous and solidifying depending on temperature, clogging of the nozzle can happen very easily. Printing with a G 21 (0. 4 mm ID) needle requires a rapid extrusion of 2. 5 mm with a feedrate of 100 mm/min, immediately before printing. Our experimentally determined printing parameters were as follows: E = 0. 4 mm/ 10 mm of path F = 400 - 600 mm/min h (layer height) = 0. 3 mm In our experiments printing took place at 20 - 21 °C ambient temperature. Printing guidelines should be followed as described above. Post-processing Printed gluten scaffolds do not require extraordinary post-processing, as the structures become stable after drying. In this regard it is important to note, that a slow and even drying process is vital to prevent post-printing deformations of the structure. Woodpile scaffolds are easy to dry. They are placed into a petri dish with a few drops of water and loosely covered for at least two days. Figure 3 : Simple woodpile scaffold from gluten. Samples In the repository you will find g-code demo files, as well as Slic 3 r setting files for the gelatin-alginate nose scaffold. Gelatin Microfluidics Introduction Due to the required high proximity of cells to blood vessels the fabrication of vascular structures has enormous impact on the engineering of tissues and organs. However, the required resolution and structural integrity is yet to be reached, thus, the fabrication of thick vascular tissues is still the main challenge to solve in tissue engineering. This protocol is a modification of the freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) method for the fabrication of freeform perfusable microfluidics inside a gelatine matrix, which can be used in the construction of vascular grafts, for the purposes of tissue and organ engineering. The FRESH method for the preparation of the gelatine matrix, which allows precise deposition of material inside a gelatin matrix, and consequently the fabrication of almost any shape or form, has been adapted after Hinton et al. 2015. The method was already shown to produce vascular tissues, our adaptation however, gives higher control over the resolution of the matrix and consequently allows for the fabrication of thinner vessels (internal diameter as low as 210 μm).

Drill the inlet and outlet holes using a CNC mill (file filename). Seal the bottom with waterproof tape Picture 1 : <b>Finished</b> <b>mould,</b> sealed with waterproof tape Step 2 : Filament Preparation Prepare a 0. 5 % w/w xanthan solution by adding xanthan to distilled water in a beaker. Stir with magnetic stirrer for at least 6 h. Make sure all bubbles are removed and the xanthan solution is fully homogenized. This ensures a consistent print. Add ink (3 drops / 20 mL) and homogenize with magnetic stirrer. This helps with channel perfusability. The solution can be stored for ~ 2 weeks at 6 °C. Step 3 : Matrix Formation (adapted from Hinton et al., 2015) Grind up gelatine in a coffee grinder for 5 - 10 min and sieve it through a < 140 µ mesh. Mesh sizes can be adjusted according to the needed smoothness of the matrix. In a beaker, prepare a 5 % gelatine solution in 50 mM CaCl 2. Add the gelatine slowly to prevent lump formation (lumps can cause inconsistencies in the print). The 50 mM CaCl 2 solution needs to be prepared with distilled water and freshly every day. Mix the gelatine solution on the magnetic stirrer for ~ 15 min, until the gelatine has soaked and all the lumps have dissolved. Wait until the undissolved gelatine has set (picture 2), remove the supernatant and add the same amount of fresh 50 mM CaCl 2 solution. Picture 2 : Layer of set gelatine. Mix the gelatine solution on the magnetic stirrer for 2 min, then repeat the procedure under 4.) 1 - 2 more times (the supernatant has to be clear, not yellowish). Remove excess liquid from the gelatine with a paper towel. An optimal gelatine slurry consistency is such, that upon tilting the beaker, the gelatine slurry moves very slowly, but does not stay still. 50 mM CaCl 2 can be added, if too much liquid was removed previously. Use a needle to fill the inlet and the outlet of the mould with the xanthan solution and pour the gelatine slurry into the mould. Step 4 : Printing the Filament Fill the syringe with 0. 5 % xanthan, making sure there are no air bubbles. Screw on the needle (we used G 21 or G 27 needles with 0. 51 mm and 0. 21 mm inner diameters, respectively). Mount the syringe onto the extruder. Position the mould on the printer, so that X 0 Y 0 Z 0 is in the lower left corner of the top face. Picture 3 : Mould scheme, indicating print starting point, thickness and inlet/outlet diameter Start the print. Step 5 : Post-Print Procedure Right after the print, wait a few minutes for the xanthan to fully crosslink (darker edges and a lighter inside can be seen - picture 4). Picture 4 : Before (LEFT) and after (RIGHT) xanthan crosslinking. For the crosslinking of gelatine, heat the print for ~ 5 min to 30 °C and then to 42 °C, until all the gelatine has completely melted. Cool the print at room temperature (maximum 24 °C - it will not solidify enough otherwise), for a minimum of 0. 5 h (if the gelatine cools too fast, there is not enough time for it to gel). Once cooled enough for the filament to be stable, cool in the fridge (~ 6 °C) until the gelation fully solidifies. To start perfusion through the printed channel, firstly gently clean the channels in the mould with a needle (G 21 - G 27), then slowly inject a small amount of pure ink on one side and keep injecting if the ink flows through the channels. Otherwise, gently push the syringe piston up and down (like "simulating a heart"), watching that the channel does not burst. Notes and Tips You can use this method to fabricate perfusable channels in any mould. Moulds can be designed and manufactured in different ways (such as 3 D printed, CNC-milled etc.). Make sure your xanthan trace starts at the inlet and ends at an outlet. sharp edges in the channel trajectory disrupt the ink flow [...] .
