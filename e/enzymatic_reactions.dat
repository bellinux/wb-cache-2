5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions,</b> displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions</b> until the early 20th century.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the capacity of}} a diffusion-based molecular communication link assuming the receiver uses chemical reactions. The key contribution is we show that <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycles, which is a class of chemical reactions commonly found in cells consisting of a forward and a backward <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction,</b> can improve {{the capacity of the}} communication link. The technical difficulty in analysing <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycles is that their reaction rates are nonlinear. We deal with this by assuming that the amount of certain chemicals in the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycle is large. In order to simplify the problem further, we use singular perturbation to study a particular operating regime of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycles. This allows us to derive a closed-form expression of the channel gain. This expression suggests that we can improve the channel gain by increasing the total amount of substrate in the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycle. By using numerical calculations, we show that the effect of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycle is to increase the channel gain and to reduce the noise, which results in a better signalto- noise ratio and in turn a higher communication capacity. Furthermore, we show that we can increase the capacity by increasing the total amount of substrate in the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> cycle. Comment: 38 Pages, 10 Figure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{different}} approaches {{were used to}} study the kinetics of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> under heterogeneous conditions to interpret the unusual nonlinear pharmacokinetics of mibefradil. Firstly, a detailed model based on the kinetic differential equations is proposed to study the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> under spatial constraints and in vivo conditions. Secondly, Monte Carlo simulations of the enzyme reaction in a two-dimensional square lattice, placing special emphasis on the input and output of the substrate were applied to mimic in vivo conditions. Both the mathematical model and the Monte Carlo simulations for the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> reproduced the classical Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics in homogeneous media and unusual kinetics in fractal media. Based on these findings, a time-dependent version of the classic MM equation was developed for {{the rate of change}} of the substrate concentration in disordered media and was successfully used to describe the experimental plasma concentration-time data of mibefradil and derive estimates for the model parameters. The unusual nonlinear pharmacokinetics of mibefradil originates from the heterogeneous conditions in the reaction space of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction.</b> The modified MM equation can describe the pharmacokinetics of mibefradil as it is able to capture the heterogeneity of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reaction</b> in disordered media...|$|R

25|$|Iron is an {{essential}} bioelement for most forms of life, from bacteria to mammals. Its importance lies {{in its ability to}} mediate electron transfer.

25|$|Vitamin C is an {{essential}} nutrient for certain animals including humans. Vitamin C describes several vitamers that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert according to pH. Vitamin C is a cofactor in at least eight <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions,</b> including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. In animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. Ascorbate also acts as an antioxidant, protecting against oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Acidosis is a {{condition}} in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value. Alkalosis is {{a condition}} in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions - are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions,</b> which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions</b> that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. <b>Enzymatic</b> <b>reactions</b> within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E
25|$|Malic acid, {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (unripe) apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, malic acid is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in <b>enzymatic</b> <b>reactions</b> that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of malic acid in grape berries are at their peak just before veraison, when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, malic acid is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of malic acid is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the malic acid is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|E
