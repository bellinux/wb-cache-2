5|$|Roberts carried {{legislation}} which revised Colorado's surface rights laws, requiring {{oil and gas}} {{companies to}} minimize the impacts of drilling.

5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

5|$|Exit {{numbers were}} {{originally}} sequential but are assigned today by mileage from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} majority of U.S. states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of Interstate 70 (I-70) east <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, California State Engineer A.D. Edmonston {{proposed}} the Feather River Project, the direct predecessor to the SWP, {{which included a}} major dam on the Feather River at Oroville, and aqueducts and pumping plants to transfer stored water to destinations in central and southern California. The proposed project was strongly opposed by voters in Northern California and parts of Southern California that received water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River, but was supported by other Southern Californians and San Joaquin Valley farmers. However, major flooding in the 1950s prompted the 1957 passage of an emergency flood-control bill that provided sufficient funding for construction for a dam at Oroville – {{regardless of whether it}} would become part of the SWP.|$|E

5|$|The Colorado Ranger is a horse breed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> High Plains in the United States. The breed is {{descended from}} two stallions {{imported}} from Turkey to the US state of Virginia {{in the late}} 1800s. These stallions were then bred to ranch horses in Nebraska and Colorado, {{and in the early}} 1900s the two stallions who every registered Colorado Ranger traces to, Patches #1 and Max #2, were foaled. The breed was championed by rancher Mike Ruby, who founded the Colorado Ranger Horse Association in 1935. Original registry membership limits resulted in many Colorado Ranger horses being registered instead as Appaloosas, but pedigree research is ongoing to discover additional horses who trace their ancestry back to the original stallions.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as the San Andreas Fault. Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E

The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, {{prior to the start of}} the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme.

5|$|As the 1950s began, {{demand on}} the Colorado River – which forms {{the border of}} California and Arizona and {{provided}} most of Southern California's water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin {{as part of a}} larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on the Colorado. The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the North Coast region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of the Colorado River Basin. One of the key projects was an aqueduct to transport North Coast water to the Imperial Valley, reducing its reliance on water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{began their}} 2009 season {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd of 44,532 at Citizens Bank Park on April 5, playing against the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies, {{originally}} scheduled to play in the afternoon of April 6, earned the distinction of playing the opening game of the entire 2009 Major League Baseball season after winning the 2008 World Series. They lost the opener 4–1 to the division-rival Braves, whose new ace, Derek Lowe, pitched eight shutout innings. The Phillies lost the next game, and were in danger of losing the following night and dropping to 0–3 before scoring eight runs {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning for a 12–11 come-from-behind win. The Phillies lost their first game in Denver, but came from behind again in their next two games to take the second series <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> Rockies. The Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, just hours after the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather. In their series against the San Diego Padres, the Phillies dropped the first two games as well; during the second game, closer Brad Lidge blew his first save in a Phillies uniform, breaking his streak of 47 consecutive saves extending back to the 2007 regular season. The Phillies won the Sunday afternoon matinee against the Padres, 5–4, on a walk-off home run by Ibáñez after trailing the entire game.|$|E
