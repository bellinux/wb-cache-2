30|$|We {{apply the}} KwTP to the Norwegian fire {{insurance}} claims {{data for the}} years 1988 and 1990. Several authors have analyzed these data. See for example, Mdziniso and Cooray (2017) and related references in the paper. The 1988 Norwegian fire claims data consist of 827 fire insurance losses in thousand Norwegian <b>krones,</b> ranging from 500 to 465, 365 thousand Norwegian <b>krones.</b> The 1990 Norwegian fire data consist of 628 fire insurance losses in thousand Norwegian <b>krones,</b> ranging from 500 to 78, 537 thousand Norwegian <b>krones.</b> Data for both years are highly positively skewed. Using these data, Mdziniso and Cooray (2017) compared the performances of the Pareto (P), the 3 -paramater generalized Pareto (GP), the odd-Pareto (OP) and its extension (OP ∗), the 3 -parameter Burr, the exponentiated Pareto (EP), the exponentiated odd Pareto (EOP) and the odd generalized Pareto (OGP) distributions.|$|R
