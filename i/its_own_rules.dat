5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as the security services (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current state}} of the system developped at the ENST (Paris) in relastonship with the ONOMASTICA project. We will show that releasing the real-time constraint in our Grapheme to Phoneme system allows the construction of a fairly economic, easily maintainable and reliable rule set, capable of transcribing both common words and proper names. In particular, we demonstrate the gain of decomposing the rewriting process into three majors steps, each step being devoted <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>rule</b> set (and possibly <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>rule</b> engine), these three steps beeing : 1. Grapheme to Grapheme (G 2 G) rules 2. Grapheme to Phoneme (G 2 P) rules 3. Phoneme to Phoneme (P 2 P) rules This schema provides a better organization of rules between "accidental" ones (which mainly serve to tackle archaisms, etymologically-disadvantaged and other lexical weirdos), and more productive rules. The latter have again been divided between orthographical and phonological rules. This organization allows to resolve most [...] ...|$|R
