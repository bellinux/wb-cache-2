25|$|While the Ferraris {{pulled away}} (Alesi {{pulling away from}} Berger), Häkkinen passed Herbert (in the spare Lotus, an older car) who retired on lap 13 when his {{alternator}} failed. Alesi then pitted but his car refused to <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> {{when he tried to}} rejoin resulting in his retirement. During Berger's stop, he was blocked by another car which was going into the pit. In his frustration, he accidentally stalled the car exiting his stop and lost over 10 seconds, dropping back to third. Coulthard also got ahead of Hill during the stops, however Hill passed Coulthard on lap 29 to take the lead.|$|E
50|$|The Sauber C30s of Kamui Kobayashi and seventh-placed Sergio Pérez retired with {{near-identical}} gearbox problems, {{reducing the}} field to just fifteen drivers plus Daniel Ricciardo. Ricciardo's car had gone into anti-stall on the grid before failing to <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear.</b> The car was immediately returned to the pits while repairs were carried out, and although Ricciardo returned to the circuit, he was some eight laps behind the last-placed Timo Glock {{at the time of}} Pérez's retirement. Ricciardo would ultimately finish the race fourteen laps behind race winner Vettel, and was therefore not classified as a finisher as he had failed to complete 90% of the winner's race distance. With just fifteen drivers on the track, the Team Lotus drivers of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli were able to secure 13th and 14th place, further reinforcing the team's claim to tenth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
50|$|Alain Prost, Lauda's team {{mate and}} the World Championship leader {{going into the}} race, failed to finish after {{spinning}} off on oil at the Jochen Rindt Curve on lap 28. Prost had been running a close second behind Piquet {{at the time of}} his spin. Piquet came upon the oil first and managed to keep his car from sliding off despite a twitch on the oil. Prost however was having gear selection problems and hit the oil with one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the gear lever holding his McLaren-TAG in gear. As a result, he could not control the car and spun off into retirement. This saw Lauda move to second behind Piquet who was having tyre troubles. After taking the lead Lauda then suddenly found he could not <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> and it appeared his race was over as he slowed significantly while desperately trying to find a working gear. The problem proved to be temporary though and soon the McLaren was going at speed again and he went on to a 23-second win.|$|E
500|$|The {{mechanical}} clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower {{featured a}} great driving-wheel that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, {{into each of}} which water poured at a uniform rate from the [...] "constant-level tank" [...] (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in <b>a</b> pinion which <b>engaged</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> wheel {{at the lower end}} of the main vertical transmission shaft.|$|R
5000|$|When a UniTrol {{snowblower}} is running, {{the engine}} is always turning a drive platter. The act of <b>engaging</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> presses <b>a</b> rubber-edged wheel against the flat steel surface of the spinning platter, which transfers power through 90 degrees to the drive axle and at a ratio inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} center of the platter at which the wheel is <b>engaged.</b> <b>A</b> neutral [...] "gear" [...] is available by simply lifting the wheel from the surface of the platter, and <b>a</b> reverse <b>gear</b> is available by engaging the wheel at a symmetric point across the center of the platter.|$|R
5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. To <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy to engage. However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|R
50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|E
40|$|In gearbox {{synchronizer}} design process, {{the most}} important parameter to be determined is the effort required to <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> within specified time interval (or vice versa – engaging time for the specified effort). Usually, reduction of said effort implies {{one of the following}} approaches: choosing a friction cone as large as possible, or using a multi-cone design. However, according to practical experience and investigations of shifting process, engaging effort may not be the decisive factor in shifting quality assessment. One can observe that during shifting the force exertion process often has two stages. The first stage {{is a result of the}} synchronization process itself. The existing second stage, effort amount, and instability of force observed at this stage while repeating shifts, require a thorough investigation. Therefore, the subject of the work was the shifting process stages that affect the engaging effort. The paper gives the certain characteristics of shifting process to demonstrate that there is the second stage in force exertion. The paper describes a technique for calculating the force acting on synchronizing sleeve and presents results of such calculations for several types of synchronizers. These results showed that in the case when tooth rims of a synchronizing sleeve and a gearwheel situated against each other in an adverse way, simultaneous sleeve movement and gearwheel rotation exert the second peak of the force comparable with synchronization effort (≈ 53 … 71 %). The remainder of the paper shows the ways to decrease said second force peak. Recommendations for synchronizers design improvement are given as well. The conclusion has been made that technical requirements for modern synchronizer design, apart from the maximum synchronization effort, must provide relative maximum value of the second peak of at most 1 / 3 of synchronization effort. This will ensure improved perception of the shifting process. </p...|$|E
50|$|A rack lift {{is a type}} of {{elevator}} {{which consists}} of a cage attached to vertical rails affixed to the walls of a tower or shaft and which is propelled up and down by means of an electric motor which drives <b>a</b> pinion <b>gear</b> that <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> rack <b>gear</b> which is also attached to the wall between the rails.|$|R

5000|$|The Champion Bridge Company was a {{well-known}} builder of truss bridges. [...] The bridge is a truss bridge with an approximately 100-foot span [...] To open the bridge for marine vessels, {{an electric motor}} drives <b>a</b> pinion <b>gear</b> which <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> ring <b>gear</b> {{in the base of}} the bridge.

50|$|The {{cross-slide}} (3) {{rides on}} the carriage {{and has a}} feedscrew that travels {{at right angles to}} the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be <b>engaged,</b> through <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> train, to the feed shaft (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most lathes, only one direction can be <b>engaged</b> at <b>a</b> time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train.|$|R
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>gear</b> on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|R

5000|$|Several ways to stop {{a runaway}} diesel engine are to block off the air intake, either {{physically}} using a cover or plug, or alternatively by directing a [...] fire extinguisher into the air intake to smother the engine. Engines fitted with a decompressor can also be stopped by operating the decompressor, and in a vehicle with a manual transmission it is sometimes possible to stop the engine by <b>engaging</b> <b>a</b> high <b>gear</b> (i.e. 4th, 5th, 6th etc.), with foot brake & parking brake fully applied, and letting out the clutch quickly to slow the engine RPM to a stop, without moving the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> rack. This in turn <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> spur <b>gear</b> which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the <b>gear</b> for <b>a</b> half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, traffic {{regulations}} {{in a large}} number of countries require trucks to always drive with <b>an</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>gear,</b> which in turn provides a certain amount of engine braking (viscous losses to the engine oil and air pumped through the engine and friction losses to the cylinder walls and bearings) when no accelerator pedal is applied.|$|R
5000|$|... Friden and Monroe calculators used a {{biquinary}} {{variant of}} this mechanism. Both {{were made in}} large numbers; Monroe started early in the 20th century; Friden in the 1930s. (The Marchant used a radically different and unique mechanism.) The variant mechanism worked with digits from 1 through 4 {{as shown in the}} animation; digits larger than 4 <b>engaged</b> <b>a</b> five-tooth <b>gear</b> as well as the teeth of the Leibniz wheel. This made it unnecessary for the sliding gear to travel longer distances for the higher-number digits. Otherwise, pressing a 5..9 key would require either a longer stroke (as in a Comptometer) or excessive force combined with a gently sloping cam surface.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the ratchet teeth, preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel <b>engage</b> with <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the cannon pinion allows the hands to be rotated.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur <b>gearing,</b> in which <b>a</b> pinion on the motor shaft <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> bull <b>gear</b> on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|R
2500|$|The {{central drive}} shaft, called the [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins) integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing <b>gears</b> <b>A</b> fixed <b>gear</b> mounted on one side of the rotor housing <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> ring <b>gear</b> attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft. The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears. The force of gas pressure on the rotor (to a first approximation) goes directly to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft...|$|R
50|$|Reverse (R): This engages {{reverse gear}} within the transmission, {{permitting}} {{the vehicle to}} be driven backward, and operates a switch {{to turn on the}} white backup lights for improved visibility (the switch may also activate a beeper on delivery trucks or other large vehicles to audibly warn other drivers and nearby pedestrians of the driver's reverse movement). To select reverse in most transmissions, the driver must come to a complete stop, depress the shift-lock button (or move the shift lever toward the driver in a column shifter, or move the shifter sideways along a notched channel in a console shifter) and select reverse. The driver should avoid engaging reverse while the vehicle is moving forwards, and likewise avoid engaging any forward gear while travelling backwards. On transmissions with a torque converter, doing so at very low speed (walking pace) is not harmful, but causes unnecessary wear on clutches and bands, and a sudden deceleration that not only is uncomfortable, but also uncontrollable since the brakes and the throttle contribute in the same direction. This sudden acceleration, or jerk, can still be felt when engaging the gear at standstill, but the driver normally suppresses this by holding the brakes. Travelling slowly in the right direction while engaging the gear minimizes the jerk further, which is actually beneficial to the wearing parts of the transmission. Electronically controlled transmissions may behave differently, as <b>engaging</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> at speed is essentially undefined behaviour. Some modern transmissions have a safety mechanism that will resist putting the car in reverse when the vehicle is moving forward; such a mechanism may consist of a solenoid-controlled physical barrier {{on either side of the}} reverse position, electronically <b>engaged</b> by <b>a</b> switch on the brake pedal, so that the brake pedal needs to be depressed in order to allow the selection of reverse. Some electronic transmissions prevent or delay engagement of reverse gear altogether while the car is moving.|$|R

50|$|The Electrolette was a two-person vehicle. Next {{to either}} front wheel was an {{electric}} motor of 3 horse power each. The pinion comes out at the side next the wheel and <b>engages</b> with <b>a</b> large <b>gear</b> wheel which is fixed against it. The gear and pinion are inclosed in a tight case. Thus each wheel is turned independently by its own motor. The 800 pounds of Fulmen batteries are contained in a box which is fixed in the vehicle below the carriage body and is arranged so {{that it may be}} easily slid out from the rear. Kriéger claimed at least 65 miles on a single charge. The 1700 pound Electrolette on a level grade could do 21 miles an hour, or 12 to 15 miles over an average road.|$|R
50|$|Bell housing or {{bellhousing}} is a colloquial/slang {{term for}} {{the portion of the}} transmission that covers the flywheel and the clutch or torque converter of the transmission on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and <b>engages</b> with <b>a</b> ring <b>gear</b> on the flywheel. On the opposite end to the engine is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications. However, on some transmissions, the bellhousing is a nonremovable part of the transmission case. This is particularly true with front wheel drive transmissions, which are much shorter than conventional rear wheel drive transmissions.|$|R
40|$|Thin-rim gears {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where light weight and compact design are demanded. Since the gear rim is more rigid {{in the area of}} the gear web, this influences the load as well as the contact stress distribution along the tooth face width. Conventional standard procedures for gear design assume uniform rigidity along the face width and therefore are not fully applicable to the thinrim gears tooth contact stress calculation. The objective of this paper is to evaluate effect of web arrangement on <b>a</b> thin-rim <b>gear</b> tooth contact stresses using advanced engineering tools for a numeric analysis. Three-dimensional parametric finite element model of thin-rim <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> with <b>a</b> solid <b>gear</b> is created. The gear pair contact position is chosen to load the thin-rim gear (the wheel) at the highest point of single tooth contact assuming small sliding and dry frictionless contact. Commercial finite element package Abaqus/Standard is used to determine contact stresses assuming small displacement hypothesis. The material is considered homogenous and isotropic with a linear elastic behavior. Obtained tooth contact stress contour lines as well as the maximum tooth contact stress values for various thin-rim gear web arrangements are presented...|$|R
5000|$|A {{sprocket}} or sprocket-wheel is a profiled {{wheel with}} teeth, or cogs, that mesh with a chain, track or other perforated or indented material. The name 'sprocket' applies generally to any wheel upon which radial projections <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> chain passing over it. It is distinguished from <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> in that sprockets are never meshed together directly, and differs from a pulley in that sprockets have teeth and pulleys are smooth.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles that {{generate}} power with an {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE) are generally equipped with a transmission or gearbox to change the speed-torque ratio and the direction of travel. This does not usually apply to electric vehicles because their motors can drive the vehicle both forward and backward from zero speed.

50|$|The NP242 Selec-Trac {{transfer}} case debuted alongside the Fuel-Injected 4.0L Inline-6 in the compact Jeep Cherokee in 1987. The shifter has modes 2WD - 4WD Hi Part-Time - 4WD Hi Full-Time - N - 4WD Low. There is a center differential {{that is open}} in 4WD Hi Full-Time mode and distributes torque 48/52% front-to-rear. This mode {{can be used on}} dry pavement or slippery surfaces with only a small fuel mileage penalty compared to 2WD mode. In 4WD Hi Part-Time and 4WD Low, the center differential is mechanically locked, so these modes are for slippery surfaces only. Low range <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> 2.72:1 planetary <b>gear</b> ratio for increased torque and low speeds. Overall, this system functions very much like the NP228 {{transfer case}} above, just with all of the mode and range controls via a single, console-mounted shift lever.
