Regulators allow entrants to utilize such facilities at prices reflecting {{the cost of building}} a new, efficient, large-scale network. Such sharing opportunities are extensive, covering virtually all network services, and extremely flexible, as entrants can rent facilities in small increments for short duration.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the impact on}} investment incentives of the network sharing arrangements mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, {{with a focus on}} the implications of irreversible investment. Although the goal is to promote competition, the sharing rules now in place reduce incentives to build new networks or upgrade existing ones. Such investments are irreversible [...] they involve sunk costs. The basic framework adopted by regulators allows entrants to utilize such facilities at prices reflecting what it would cost a new, efficient, large-scale network to be built. Such sharing opportunities are extensive, covering virtually the entire suite of network services provided, and extremely flexible, as the entrant can rent facilities in small increments for short duration, with no long-term contracts required. Because the entrant does not bear the sunk costs, this leads to an asymmetric allocation of risk and return that is not properly accounted for in the pricing of network services, which creates a significant <b>investment</b> <b>disincentive.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the major}} oil price {{explosion}} and collapse {{over the last}} 20 years, host governments in producing countries have made substantial changes to their petroleum tax systems. In many cases, these changes have resulted in more profit related systems being established. These have an inherent flexibility which is more appropriate for an environment of fluctuating prices. They are generally not accurately targeted on economic rents, however, and if oil prices remain low further discretionary changes may be required. In some important countries reliance on old-style systems targeted on gross revenues still remains. These are not well adapted to an era of low oil prices, and <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> are present. ...|$|R
40|$|Insecure {{property}} rights over land have multiple ramifications for agriculture {{and the organization}} of rural economic activity (Besley and Ghatak 2009). The risk that land will be expropriated deters invest-ment. Insecure {{property rights}} reduce the ability of borrowers to pledge land as collateral and thus tighten credit constraints. Ill-defined property right over land can inhibit land transactions – rentals or sales – and potential gains from trade are lost. Scarce resources, like labor, may be devoted to protecting one’s insecure rights over plots (Field 2007). In Ghana, land rights are typically gained by virtue of membership in a corporate group (e. g., extended family), but a robust market is emerging for land purchases and rentals, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas. Informal land markets in Ghana are be-set with a number of problems including land con-flicts, protracted litigation and adjudication failures, documentation bottlenecks and uncertainty. Land leg-islation in Ghana is perceived as incoherent, conflict-ing and often outdated. An unwieldy public land sec-tor dominates the documentation of land rights, rev-enue collection and distribution. Land conflicts are becoming more frequent, judicial processes are over-burdened, authority is overcentralized and corrupt. Conflict over multiple claims to particular plots occa-sionally becomes violent. Goldstein and Udry (2008) document the large <b>investment</b> <b>disincentive</b> effects of insecure tenure in agriculture in Ghana. Almost 80 % of Ghana’s land is held by custom-ary landowners, mainly families, clans and traditional authorities (Kasanga and Kotey, 2001). These own-ers often do not record transactions; indeed, many are clothed in secrecy. As land transactions gradu-ally move away from their familial/corporate base to short term rental for commercial purposes, multiple simultaneous transactions on the same plot have be...|$|E
40|$|While {{the need}} for land-related {{investment}} for sustainable land management and increased productivity is well recognized, quantitative evidence on agricultural productivity effects of secure property rights in Africa is scant. Within-household analysis of investments by owner-cum-occupants in Uganda points toward significant and quantitatively large investment effects of full ownership. Registration is estimated to have no investment effects, whereas measures to strengthen occupancy rights attenuate <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives.</b> While this supports the importance of secure tenure as a precondition for growth, it also suggests that interventions aiming to increase tenure security need to be context-specific {{for it to be}} fully effective.

40|$|Introduced in {{the mobile}} {{telecommunications}} market across world, mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) are considered {{an effective way}} to promote competition. However, possible adverse consequences for infrastructure investment of mobile network operators (MNOs) create concern. In this paper, we investigate the economic effects of NWNOs and the related regulation on MNO investment behavior. Employing firm-level data across 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, we also look at market efficiency to assess empirically the outcomes of MVNOs and regulation. We find that access regulation leads to <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> for MNOs and that volantary provision of access may create disincentives as well. Therefore, to improve both market and dynamic efficiencies, regulation needs to be directed at MNO investment incentives...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} why {{local loop}} unbundling (LLU) mostly fails. Unbundling, in principle, makes the local loop (subscriber line) available to competing operators and enables {{the development of}} complementary network devices and services among {{a larger number of}} competing firms such as fast Internet access and IP telephony. Despite its popularity among regulators, however, local loop unbundling is still little used by operators in most countries. In the paper we set out to explain this paradox. We argue, based on a transaction cost cum strategic analysis of the parties’ incentives and the transactions involved, that regulatory enforced LLU contracts supported by regulated cost-based pricing, suffer both from infrastructure <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> and inefficient contractual safeguards against the associated transaction hazards. The end result is intrusive regulation, which neither helps the new entrant nor provides much incentive for the incumbent to invest...|$|R
40|$|The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 reduced {{personal}} marginal {{tax rates}} and provided significant business tax breaks. Subsequent changes through 1985 {{cut back on}} business allowances. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced marginal rates again, but added significantly to business taxes. Was there any unifying theme to these tax changes, or do they represent frequent changes in course for tax policy?

Under the new view that dividend taxes are unimportant <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives,</b> there is no set of other parameters in the model for which these changes generate improvements in efficiency.

40|$|Evidence {{from the}} U. S. {{and some other}} {{countries}} indicates that organized wholesale markets for electrical energy and operating reserves do not provide adequate incentives to stimulate the proper quantity or mix of generating capacity consistent with mandatory reliability criteria. A {{large part of the}} problem can be associated with the failure of wholesale spot market prices for energy and operating reserves to rise to high enough levels during periods when generating capacity is fully utilized. Reforms to wholesale energy markets, the introduction of well-design forward capacity markets, and symmetrical treatment of demand response and generating capacity resources to respond to market and institutional imperfections are discussed. This policy reform program is compatible with improving the efficiency of spot wholesale electricity markets, the continued evolution of competitive retail markets, and restores incentives for efficient investment in generating capacity consistent with operating reliability criteria applied by system operators. It also responds to <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> that have been associated with volatility in wholesale energy prices, limited hedging opportunities and to concerns about regulatory opportunism. ...|$|R

A simple taxation scheme is specified and it is shown that a country can be on the “wrong side” of its debt Laffer curve only if it is on the wrong side of its tax Laffer curve. The analysis indicates that fairly strong, and probably unrealistic, assumptions about the domestic tax system are needed to argue that the <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> associated with the debt overhang are large enough to place a country on the wrong side of its debt Laffer curve.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{to what extent}} Russia's increasing reliance on foreign capital could potentially kick-start the economy and generate growth. The analysis highlights more fundamental issues of governance and institutional arrangements, for which the focus on foreign economic activities serves merely as an example to reflect on pathologies of the Russian economy as a whole. The article consists of a theoretical framework, discussing the change of institutional arrangements {{in the first section}} and analysing crucial issues of corporate governance and property rights in the last, while empirical information is compiled for Russia as a whole and its constituent regions {{in the second and third}} core sections. The article concludes that the Russian map of high foreign trade activities will be shaped only by patchy growth spots, located either where the domestic market is largest or opportunities for export exist, mainly in large urban agglomerations (economies of scale) and commercial hubs, resource-rich and gateway territories (gravitation to international trading blocs). Major <b>investment</b> <b>disincentives</b> will remain as long as the existing system of taxation has not been substantially changed, property rights are not protected, land and bankruptcy legislation is not properly enforced and local authorities are not prevented form rent-seeking activities.

In the irreversible investment literature, the firm must consider future opportunities and costs because capital expenditures are at least partly sunk. Within this context, we explore if the existence of highly liquidable assets in the company influences decisions of investment and disinvestment in productive assets and if its influence is different over each decision. We develop an investment model which allows the liquid assets stock to influence on the adjustment costs of productive assets. The developed model is then applied to a 1, 044 panel data of Spanish companies. Results evidence that highly liquidable assets are relevant on investment models. Moreover, high levels of liquidable assets stimulate <b>investment</b> and <b>disincentive</b> disinvestment in productive assets. adjustment costs; highly liquidable assets; productive assets; investment; disinvestment; q theory; convex costs; valuation; units of capital; marginal costs; future opportunities; decision making; liquid assets; Spain; economics; business research. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, {{international}} migration has assumed much prominence. Manifested in flows of permanent settlers, asylum seekers, refugees, contract workers and undocumented migrants, the global stock of international migrants has increased steadily. The current stock of international migrants ranges from 130 to 145 million. The experience with international migration is common among all geographical regions; varying only in level, type, proportion of population, and {{the duration of}} migration. ^ International migration has raised much concern among both labor-sending and labor-receiving countries. Migrant-receiving countries are increasingly concerned about the adverse affects of large scale migration, perceived diminished capacity to absorb additional migrants, impact on cultural homogeneity and the law and order situation, and the effects on job conditions of unskilled workers. The loss of professional and technical people, leading to a decrease in native talent {{to participate in the}} global system, is a major concern among labor-sending countries. ^ Apprehensive of various adverse effects, policy planners in labor-sending countries have focused a considerable amount of attention on the use of trade, aid, and <b>investment</b> as <b>disincentives</b> to migration. These policies are aimed at creating greater and better job opportunities in-migrant sending countries, reducing wage differentials, paving the way for long-term development. Underlying these issues has been the assumption that trade is a substitute for migration, and that aid and investments are adequately and appropriately geared to economic development. Past experience has, however, demonstrated that such assumptions do not always hold in reality. Factor prices, therefore, do not necessarily equalize following trade; official development assistance is inadequate and caters to domestic interest groups; and foreign investment does not create jobs for those prone to migration. ^ A widely held contrary view is now emerging where international migration is seen as being a complement to commodity trade. Migrants bring with them not only new skills and training, but, also, food habits, tastes, cultural values, and individual preferences. Their presence abroad creates a new export market for labor-exporting countries. In free economies, market forces respond to such preferences, and the desired goods get imported. A casual look at shops and market places in areas with a concentration of migrant populations testifies to the existence of such a complementarity between international and migration. ^ This study has been an attempt towards understanding and explaining the role of international migration as a complement to trade. Based on the experience of Bangladesh, it has been demonstrated that complementarity between international migration exists with respect to the export of items such as fish, vegetables, fruits, feature films, books, magazines, handicrafts, ceramic products, etc. Broadly, these refer to export items such as food, clothing and apparel, recreational and household items. ^ Such a complementarity is re-enforced by the level, concentration and composition of migrants, as well as the duration of the process of migration. A greater concentration of migrants at a particular location helps market development; longer duration enables a gradual broadening of commodity composition of exports. The migration-trade link is also affected by trade policies pursued by both the labor sending and labor receiving countries. A liberal trade policy {{on the part of a}} labor-receiving country is fundamental. However, from a labor sending country 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, trade liberalization, deregulation of restrictive measures and the development of transportation links encourage migration and trade linkages. A well-developed transportation link is particularly important. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil price}} plunge of 2014 - 2015 has {{generated}} {{a lot of}} institutional and media attention, as befits developments with an economically vital energy resource, of environmental interest and geo-political significance. There is an academic need to keep abreast of contemporary changes in the evolving oil system. This research explains {{the reasons for the}} oil price plunge and explores its implications. It contains further foci on understanding the tight oil phenomenon and assessing the meaning of the oil price drop for peak oil. Its approach is interdisciplinary and utilises concepts and theories from across the spectrum of peak oil debate, from ‘peakist’ to ‘cornucopian’ poles. Empirically, it relies on secondary analysis of quantitative data from institutional sources and academic researchers. It finds that slower demand growth, faster supply growth and maintained supply all account for the oil price fall. Slower demand growth related primarily to weak global economic growth, as well as energy efficiency and substitution trends. Faster supply growth was due predominantly to US tight oil production increases, supplemented by Canadian oil sands. The emergent market over-supply was exacerbated by OPEC’s November 2014 decision to maintain its rate of supply, while immediate geo-political factors were benign enough to avoid significant disruption and maintain production rates. An appreciating US currency also added to downward oil price pressure. Superficially, the situation of market over-supply and lower oil prices appears to contradict peak oil. Yet, it is found that peak oil is complicit in these developments. The prolonged era of high oil prices due to crude oil supply constraints, both stimulated new supply from high cost non-conventional liquids and weighed on oil demand through weak economic growth. The oil price fall is a complicated outcome of emergent oil system dynamics of the peak oil era. Tight oil supply increases show the capacity of oil industry innovation to access lesser quality, higher cost resources at meaningful rates of supply. US tight oil is probably the best of non-conventional liquids. Yet quality and cost are problematic with tight oil. It has high decline rates, variable well quality, high production costs and a comparatively modest resource base. The economics of tight oil are fragile. In the context of lower oil prices the US tight oil industry is under severe stress. These implications for future supply are a key issue emerging from this research. Lower oil prices strain the oil industry generally, and <b>disincentive</b> <b>investments</b> in future production. Future supply growth is very investment sensitive; it must come from high cost resources. Yet, high cost resources are uneconomic at lower oil prices. If lower oil prices are sustained, and Saudi Arabia appears intent on this, future supply growth is vulnerable. This is economically problematic, as lower oil prices are simultaneously supporting demand growth through an improving economic outlook. This sets the conditions for future market under-supply and high oil prices, which would again undermine economic growth. These emergent feedbacks between oil supply and economic growth require ongoing analytical attention. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R
