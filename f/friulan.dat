25|$|This {{linguistic}} dispute became politically {{relevant for}} the Italian irredentist movement. Italian nationalists interpreted Battisti's hypothesis as implying that Romansh, <b>Friulan</b> and Ladin were not separate languages but rather Italian dialects. They used {{this as an}} argument to claim the territories for Italy where these languages were spoken. From a sociolinguistic perspective, however, this question is largely irrelevant. The speakers of Romansh have always identified as speaking a language distinct from both Italian and other Romance varieties.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the forms}} castigated in the Appendix Probi {{proved to be the}} forms {{accepted}} in Romance; e.g., oricla (evolved from the Classical Latin marked diminutive auricula) is the source of French oreille, Catalan orella, Spanish oreja, Italian orecchia, Romanian ureche, Portuguese orelha, Sardinian orija 'ear', not the prescribed auris. Development of yod from the post-nasal unstressed /e/ of vinea enabled the palatalization of /n/ that would produce French vigne, Italian vigna, Spanish viña, Portuguese vinha, Catalan vinya, Occitan vinha, <b>Friulan</b> vigne, etc., 'vineyard'.|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Romansh, <b>Friulan</b> and Ladin should {{compose a}} {{separate}} [...] "Rhaeto-Romance" [...] subgroup within Gallo-Romance is an unresolved issue, {{known as the}} Questione ladina. Some linguists posit that these languages are descended from a common language, which was fractured geographically through the spread of German and Italian. The Italian linguist Graziadio Ascoli first made the claim in 1873. The other position holds that any similarities between these three languages can be explained through their relative geographic isolation, which shielded them from certain linguistic changes. By contrast, the Gallo-Italic varieties of Northern Italy were more open to linguistic influences from the South. Linguists who take this position often {{point out that the}} similarities between the languages are comparatively few. This position was first introduced by the Italian dialectologist Carlo Battisti.|$|E

60|$|I {{think the}} Stornelli {{of the revolutionary}} period of 1848 have a {{peculiar}} value, because they embody, in forms of artistic perfection, the evanescent {{as well as the}} enduring qualities of popular feeling. They give us what had otherwise been lost, in the passing humor of the time. They do not celebrate the battles or the great political occurrences. If they deal with events at all, is it with events that express some belief or longing,--rather with what people hoped or dreamed than with what they did. They sing the <b>Friulan</b> volunteers, who bore the laurel instead of the olive during Holy Week, in token that the patriotic war had become a religion; they remind us that the first fruits of Italian longing for unity were the cannons sent to the Romans by the Genoese; they tell us that the tricolor was placed in the hand of the statue of Marcus Aurelius at the Capitol, to signify that Rome was no more, and that Italy was to be. But the Stornelli touch with most effect those yet more intimate ties between national and individual life that vibrate in the hearts of the Livornese and the Lombard woman, of the lover who sees his bride in the patriotic colors, of the maiden who will be a sister of charity that she may follow her lover through all perils, of the mother who names her new-born babe Costanza in the very hour of the Venetian republic's fall. And I like the Stornelli all the better because they preserve the generous ardor of the time, even in its fondness and excess.|$|E

5000|$|Friulian or <b>Friulan</b> ( [...] or, affectionately, [...] in Friulian, [...] in Italian, [...] in German, [...] in Slovene; also Friulian) is a Romance {{language}} {{belonging to}} the Rhaeto-Romance family, spoken in the Friuli region of northeastern Italy. Friulian has around 600,000 speakers, {{the vast majority of}} whom also speak Italian. It is sometimes called Eastern Ladin since it shares the same roots as Ladin, but, over the centuries, it has diverged under the influence of surrounding languages, including German, Italian, Venetian, and Slovene. Documents in Friulian are attested from the 11th century and poetry and literature date as far back as 1300. By the 20th century, there was a revival of interest in the language that has continued to this day.In North America the more common English form is <b>Friulan</b> for both the language and the ethnic identity of the people living in Friuli and abroad. <b>Friulan</b> follows the example of Friulano in Italian.

Here he joined a group of other young enthusiasts of the <b>Friulan</b> dialect who wanted to give Casarsa <b>Friulan</b> a status equal to that of Udine, the official regional standard.
