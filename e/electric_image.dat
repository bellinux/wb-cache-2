50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>Image,</b> Inc. {{was always}} a small company that {{produced}} software on the Mac platform and so never had a large a market share. Play, Inc. purchased <b>Electric</b> <b>Image</b> corporation in November 1998. The first version of EIAS released under the Play moniker was version 2.9. Play later released the 3.0 version. This was the first version to run on Windows, and to mark this move, Play renamed the package <b>Electric</b> <b>Image</b> Universe. Play was never a greatly successful company, and so <b>Electric</b> <b>Image</b> Universe stagnated during the time they owned it.|$|E

On September 19, 2000, the company bought back {{the shares of}} <b>Electric</b> <b>Image</b> from Play and set about to recapture the products former customer base. The new company released version 4.0 and 5.0 under the <b>Electric</b> <b>Image</b> moniker.

40|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish use active electrolocation - {{the generation}} and detection of electric currents - {{to explore their}} surroundings. Although electrosensory systems include {{some of the most}} extensively understood circuits in the vertebrate central nervous system, relatively little is known quantitatively about how fish electrolocate objects. We believe a prerequisite to understanding electrolocation and its underlying neural substrates is to quantify and visualize the peripheral electrosensory information measured by the electroreceptors. We have therefore focused on reconstructing both the electric organ discharges (EODs) and the <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> resulting from nearby objects and the fish's exploratory behaviors. Here, we review results from a combination of techniques, including field measurements, numerical and semi-analytical simulations, and video imaging of behaviors. EOD maps are presented and interpreted for six gymnotiform species. They reveal diverse electric field patterns that have significant implications for both the electrosensory and electromotor systems. Our simulations generated predictions of the <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> from nearby objects as well as sequences of <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> during exploratory behaviors. These methods are leading to the identification of image features and computational algorithms that could reliably encode electrosensory information and may help guide electrophysiological experiments exploring the neural basis of electrolocation...|$|R
40|$|Modeling the <b>electric</b> {{field and}} <b>images</b> in <b>electric</b> fish {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of the pre-receptor conditioning of <b>electric</b> <b>images.</b> Although the boundary element method has been very successful for calculating images and fields, complex electric organ discharges pose a challenge for active electroreception modeling. We have previously developed a direct method for calculating <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> which takes into account the structure and physiology of the electric organ as well as the geometry and resistivity of fish tissues. The present article reports a general application of our simulator for studying <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> in <b>electric</b> fish with heterogeneous, extended electric organs. We studied three species of Gymnotiformes, including both wave-type (Apteronotus albifrons) and pulse-type (Gymnotus obscurus and Gymnotus coropinae) fish, with electric organs of different complexity. The results are compared with the African (Gnathonemus petersii) and American (Gymnotus omarorum) electric fish studied previously. We address the following issues: 1) how to calculate equivalent source distributions based on experimental measurements, 2) how the complexity of the electric organ discharge determines the features of the electric field and 3) how the basal field determines the characteristics of <b>electric</b> <b>images.</b> Our findings allow us to generalize the hypothesis (previously posed for G. omarorum) in which the perioral region and the rest of the body play different sensory roles. While the "electrosensory fovea" appears suitable for exploring objects in detail, the rest of the body is likened to a "peripheral retina" for detecting the presence and movement of surrounding objects. We discuss the commonalities and differences between species. Compared to African species, American electric fish show a weaker field. This feature, derived from the complexity of distributed electric organs, may endow Gymnotiformes with the ability to emit site-specific signals to be detected in the short range by a conspecific and the possibility to evolve predator avoidance strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Infrared {{thermograph}} {{has been}} applied in electric equipment inspection widely, but the visual effects of infrared images are always undesirable. Considering the limitation of low luminance，low contrast in infrared images，an enhancement method based on fuzzy Renyi entropy and quantum genetic algorithm is presented in this paper．Firstly，the contrast-sketching function presented in [1] is improved {{based on the idea}} of segmentation. Then, in order to segment the infrared image, Renyi entropy is extend to fuzzy domain considering the fuzzy nature of infrared image, and is employed to threshold the infrared image following maximal entropy principle. In order to meet the real-time demand of online monitoring, quantum genetic algorithm is employed to search the optimal parameters of the transform function. The experimental results indicate that the method can well improve the visual effect of infrared <b>electric</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish use {{a unique}} sensory modality {{in order to}} help them communicate, navigate and find prey. These fish emit electric discharges that are monitored by electroreceptors located in the fish's skin. Surrounding objects perturb these baseline transdermal potentials and create <b>electric</b> <b>images.</b> The study of these images has led {{to a better understanding of}} general sensory processing principles; however, many aspects of these fish's natural electrosensory environment remain unknown. To this end, a two-dimensional finite element model of Apteronotus leptorhynchus was created. Using this model, we suggest new ways by which electric fish are able to locate objects and propose that it is possible for these fish to extract useful information from their environment using their natural scanning behaviour. Our results also reveal important limitations in standard experimental paradigms that aim to mimic the effects of conspecifics. Alternative paradigms that will enable more realistic stimulation are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Certain {{electric}} fish use a self-generated AC {{electric field}} to navigate and hunt. Thousands of sensors {{on the surface}} of the fish’s body detect the pattern of amplitude and phase distortions of the field caused by nearby objects. Prior research has suggested that phase distortions may be especially useful for recognition of live objects. Here we present the first study of the utility of phase information in a robotic implementation of active electrosense. Using our robotic implementation, we investigated how the phase information depends on the frequency of the emitted field, the conductivity of the surrounding water, and object properties. An analytical model was developed serving as qualitative explanation of the dependency. We show that in certain situations phase information enables discrimination between two ob-jects that are otherwise very similar in the amplitude of their <b>electric</b> <b>images.</b> We also show the utility of probing objects with multiple frequencies.

40|$|International audienceThe weakly {{electric}} {{fish can}} perform complex cognitive tasks based on extracting information from blurry <b>electric</b> <b>images</b> projected from their immediate environment onto their electro-sensitive skin.

In this article we artificially reproduce and combine these PMA to build an autonomous control strategy that allows an artificial electric sensor to find electrically contrasted objects and to orbit around them based on a minimum set of measurements and simple reactive feedback control laws of the probe's motion. The approach does not require any simulation model and could be implemented on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with artificial electric sense.
