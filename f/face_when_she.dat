5|$|The {{following}} month, Sarita {{entered a}} feud with Velvet Sky, scoring back-to-back pinfall victories over {{her on the}} October 28 and the November 4 episodes of Impact!, first in a six-woman tag team match {{and then in a}} singles match. Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a <b>face,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> answered the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match. On the February 10 episode of Impact!, Sarita's on-screen cousin, Rosita, made her TNA debut in an eight-woman tag team match, where the duo teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love, Mickie James, Velvet Sky and Winter. The following week, Sarita and Rosita aligned themselves with Hernandez, who had returned from working in Mexico the previous week and had begun expressing anti-American views. Later in the evening, Sarita and Rosita defeated Angelina Love and Velvet Sky in a tag team match. Afterwards, Sky challenged Sarita to a one-on-one match, where she agreed to put her career on the line. On the March 3 episode of Impact!, Sky was able to defeat Sarita in a singles match, salvaging her career in the process.|$|E

25|$|Jeffreys's DNA {{method was}} first {{put to use}} in 1985 {{when he was asked}} to help in a disputed {{immigration}} case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from Ghana. The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to {{the other members of the}} family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's <b>face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> heard the results. DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls. This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. In 1992, Jeffreys' methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele, who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a femur bone of his exhumed skeleton, with DNA from his widow and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.|$|E

500|$|White {{men began}} {{surrounding}} houses, pouring kerosene on and lighting them, then shooting {{at those who}} emerged.

She {{was killed by a}} shotgun blast to the <b>face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> fled from hiding underneath her home, which had been set on fire by the mob. Fannie Taylor's brother-in-law claimed to be her killer. On January 5, more whites converged on the area, forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people. [...] Some came from out of state. Mingo Williams, who was [...] away near Bronson, was collecting turpentine sap {{by the side of the}} road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name. As was custom among many residents of Levy County, both black and white, Williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name; when he gave his nickname of [...] "Lord God", they shot him dead.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's <b>face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

In [...] "The Job", Dwight offers Pam {{the position of}} [...] "Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight {{to be involved in}} something secret, she accepts.

2500|$|I brought Beyoncé {{a number}} of {{references}} and we picked some out together. Most were German modern-dance references, believe it or not. But it really evolved. The references were then dispersed to her creative team (hair, makeup, wardrobe), and they interpreted them on the set in their own special way. Of course, {{one of the strongest}} wardrobe references was Audrey Hepburn in Funny <b>Face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> does the beatnik dance scene. I think a lot grew from there. [...] The shoot was great. We had {{a number of}} brilliant dancers and musicians and a top-notch crew. Beyoncé brings in a number of her own people who are so hardworking. Our video was the fourth they had shot in five days. I love the creative team that works with Beyoncé because they can roll with anything and keep smiling. Everyone was really upbeat and excited because we all love the track and the opportunity to work with Beyoncé so much.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 December 2011 Digital Spy {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan the couple's wedding as a surprise for Nancy. Dawson explained that it is initially Darren's idea to have a surprise wedding as he is content with his life and wants a way to [...] "show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". Dawson {{felt that this was}} not a good idea as Nancy would want a [...] "classy" [...] wedding which Darren can not afford. He said that when Nancy discovers his plans Darren expects she will be [...] "delighted" [...] but Nancy is [...] "the sort of woman who'd be fussy about her wedding" [...] so she may not react how Darren would expect. Fox said that Nancy would [...] "be horrified [...] because she is a control freak. [...] I don't know if it's Darren's wisest move, but I think Nancy would also see that he has good intentions". Dawson felt that Darren is [...] "incredibly excited" [...] for the wedding, especially because of the hard work and planning he has put into it. He said that as far as Darren is [...] "concerned, it's going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's <b>face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> realises what he's been up to".

2500|$|Edwards {{argued that}} the {{adolescents}} of Mansfield Park are in many ways still children, and the danger of Lover's Vows is that the amateur actors cannot distinguish between acting and life, a point grasped by Mary who says [...] "What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?". In this regard, {{the danger of the}} Crawfords is that they are always acting, and for them, Lover's Vows is a way to win Edmund and Maria, as both the Betrams come to understand. Edwards argues that Mansfield Park is considered difficult today because [...] "There is little charm to these children, whose dominant emotion seems to be malice...only Fanny has full consciousness in the better sense, sympathetic understanding of what others feel." [...] For example, when Edmund agrees to act in Lover's Vows, Tom and Maria only feel [...] "glee" [...] at the thought of the would be clergyman acting in an improper play, Maria enjoys seeing the discomfort on Julia's <b>face</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> acts with Henry, and Mary tells Fanny to marry Henry to [...] "pay off the debts of one's sex" [...] and to have a [...] "triumph" [...] at the expense of her brother. Through Price is the most likeable character in the novel, even she has been made flawed by Austen as her morality is [...] "limited". Edwards called Price the [...] "most human" [...] of all the Austen heroines as she sometimes has negative emotions as when she tells Edmund that Mary wanted to marry him because she knew Tom was dying, and feels [...] "gaiety" [...] at his pain. Likewise, Edwards argued that Edmund was the [...] "most believable" [...] of Austen's heroes precisely he has [...] "limitations", and there is [...] "much here to respect" [...] about Edmund, a prodding, if honest and good hearted man. Edwards noted that even when Edmund saw Mary for the last time, it is implied he was still sad to [...] "close the door" [...] on her forever. Edwards argued that both Edmund and Fanny are flawed characters who are perfect for each other for that very reason. Edwards concluded [...] "Fanny and Edmund learn less, but that is the point; for once we are to consider people, who like most people, have no superabundance of wit and charm and wisdom are to get along in the world. They get along, quite simply, by avoiding what they cannot understand." ...|$|E
