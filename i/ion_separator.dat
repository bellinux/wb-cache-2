40|$|We {{implemented}} {{a new concept}} for heavy element chemistry research using an <b>ion</b> <b>separator</b> to separate the desired products from the beam, transfer products and other undesirable by-products prior to chemical studies. First, a Recoil product Transfer Chamber (RTC) was designed and attached to the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS) to collect and transfer the recoiling products to the chemical separation system. The RTC consists of a wire-grid-supported thin mylar foil ({le}) 200 {micro}g/cm{sup 2 } that separates the BGS detector chamber, at 1. 3 mbar pressure, from the chemistry system at different pressures ranging from 480 mbar to 2000 mbar. The overall transport efficiency ranged between 30 % and 15 %, compared to the activity measured in the focal plane detector of the BGS. The CTS {{was designed as a}} separation and {alpha}-decay detection system for the highly volatile tetroxides of osmium and hassium, element 108. The CTS, shown in figure 1, consists of two rows of 32 -{alpha} detectors arranged along a negative temperature gradient. The tetroxides adsorb on the surface of one of the silicone photodiodes at a certain deposition temperature, and the nuclide is then identified by the {alpha}-decay. To test the CTS with the expected hassium homologue osmium, different {alpha}-active osmium isotopes were produced using the nuclear reactions {sup 118 }Sn({sup 56 }Fe, 4, 5 n) {sup 170, 169 }Os and {sup 120 }Sn({sup 56 }Fe, 4, 5 n) {sup 172, 171 }Os. After preseparation in the BGS, a mixture of 90 % helium and 10 % oxygen was used to transport the osmium to a quartz tube heated to 1225 K, where OsO{sub 4 } was formed. The negative temperature gradient in the CTS ranged from 248 K to 173 K. Using a flow rate of 500 mL/min, most of the osmium activity was adsorbed at a temperature of about 203 K.

40|$|Battery Science & TechnologyLithium {{manganese}} oxide spinel materials have been extensively studied as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries {{because it is}} inexpensive, safe, and eco-friendly. One critical shortcoming for this material is, however, the poor cycle stability that is mainly associated with manganese dissolution during extended cycling, especially at elevated temperature (> 50 oC). To relieve the capacity fading of LiMn 2 O 4 /graphite cells caused by manganese dissolution, we develop the functional binder and <b>separator</b> having <b>ion</b> exchangeability between dissolved Mn ions and Na ions of functional materials. First of all, three ion-exchangeable binders including carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC), poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS), and alginic acid sodium salt (AGA) are compared with the conventional binder of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF). From the galvanostatic experiments of LiMn 2 O 4 /graphite full cells at high temperature (60 oC), the ion-exchangeable binders for graphite anode show a noticeable improvement in the capacity retention. This is attributed to that the dissolved Mn ions are trapped in the ion exchangeable binders due to ion exchange between manganese ions in electrolytes and sodium ions of binders. In other words, the ion-exchangeable binders prevent the reduction of dissolved Mn ions at the surface of graphite anode, resulting in the improvement of cycle performance. This {{is supported by the}} analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for Mn-dissolved electrolytes and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for lithiated graphite anode.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} two distinct projects: the synthesis {{and design of}} novel cell penetrating peptides mimics (CPPMs), and {{the implementation of the}} thiol-ene click reaction to generate new polymer architectures and chemistries. Guanidinium-rich CPPMs were generated through both ROMP and RAFT polymerizations, allowing for a comparison to be made across polymer backbone chemistries with respect to both siRNA and protein cellular internalization. A particularly effective methacrylate derived block copolymer was able to deliver siRNA to nearly an entire Jurkat T cell population. The thiol-ene reaction was implemented initially within the context of improving material design for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), specifically lithium <b>ion</b> <b>separators.</b> Synthesis of styrene-ethylene oxide multiblock copolymer electrolytes by the combination of telechelic di-thiol and di-norbornene polymers was performed. Morphology and conductivity were assessed as a function of conducting block volume fraction, with encouraging results and robust conductivities above a PEO volume fraction of 0. 5. Flory-Huggins interaction parameters were also estimated and compared to literature projections. New SPE chemistries utilizing thioethers, sulfoxides, and sulfones were also synthesized through the step-growth polymerization of various di-ene and di-thiol monomers. When doped with lithium ions, these materials demonstrated comparable conductivities to PEO, a benchmark SPE, and could be tuned to eliminate crystallization, a severe drawback of PEO at lower temperatures. These SPEs were also strengthened by polystyrene incorporation, resulting in block copolymer materials that demonstrated a room temperature storage modulus of 0. 1 GPa, while maintaining high levels of conductivity. Finally, the universality of the thiol-ene polymerization was demonstrated by the generation of main-chain carbonate, main-chain zwitterion, and side-chain diol polymers. Similarly to the above SPE materials, these polymers contained a thioether functional group that could selectively be oxidized to yield either a sulfoxide or sulfone, without degrading the polymer or affecting the incorporated functional groups.
