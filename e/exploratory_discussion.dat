We define market making expenditures, explore the different types of expenditure, and examine strategies for maximizing the appropriability of market making investments.

The findings reveal that while data centres were initially concentrated in London, a range of new urban, suburban and remote rural locations are becoming increasingly important.

While Romania was not the first socialist country to become a member (Yugoslavia had been a member for some time), it was the first member of the Comecon to join.

40|$|Reflection {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as important for learning from practice in Nursing. Academic reflective writing (ARW) is increasingly being used to assess reflective practice. However, there is currently scant literature on ARW, which is extremely complex, requiring students to link their own experiences to published literature. There are also concerns in the literature about the validity of ARW as a medium of assessment. In this paper, an <b>exploratory</b> <b>discussion</b> on ARW is illustrated with reference to the views of 8 self-selected students on a course for post-registered nurses. These students found ARW extremely challenging, and highlighted a range of difficulties associated with it. In conclusion, it is argued that the student experience of ARW warrants further investigation. In addition, it is suggested that either scaffolding should be put in place to facilitate the production of successful ARW, or alternatives should be explored...|$|E

The present paper describes some initiatives to develop mental health services in one district of the country. A bottom-up approach in the district resulted in the formation of a community-led mental health program with strong support from two self-help groups, district political leaders and district representatives in parliament. Primary health care providers at all levels of health care in the district were trained in order to make services accessible to the rural population. Further plans based on initial <b>exploratory</b> <b>discussions</b> aim to involve the education department, the welfare and probation office, prisons and police, the military, church and cultural leaders and traditional healers.

40|$|Community or {{reassurance}} policing in the UK {{has developed}} concurrently with diversification {{and expansion of}} the policing family, including the broadening of volunteer opportunities beyond the traditional Special Constable and Police Support Volunteer roles. To increase capacity and capability in community-based policing, one Force introduced Volunteer Police Community Support Officers (VPCSOs) to complement that of employed PCSOs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the early progress {{that is being}} made to implement the Care Act 2014 in England {{with regard to the}} care and support needs of people who are homeless. It outlines <b>exploratory</b> <b>discussions</b> that were generated through a series of interprofessional ‘community of practice’ meetings. These meetings highlighted practice challenges and emerging strategies to overcome them, from the perspective of both local authority social workers and homelessness practitioners. Three main themes emerged and we discuss these under context-related headings: (i) legal change, (ii) homelessness and (iii) the local authority as an organisation. In summary, homelessness practitioners spoke about efforts to become legally literate in order to support people who are homeless to access adult social care. They reported that they often encountered barriers or fragmented responses. Statutory social workers spoke about encountering homelessness as an atypical form of vulnerability and grappling with how their needs relate to the new eligibility framework alongside significant budgetary pressure. The findings link strongly with theoretical strands around the nature of legal literacy, constructions of vulnerability and the impact of austerity on ‘street-level bureaucracies’...|$|R

However, given the separatist government of Quebec's position that there be two nations established first in accordance with Resolution 176, approval by Quebec of any changes to the BNA Act was impossible. This assertion of national duality was immediately followed with Resolution 177 that stated, [...] "Quebec will never agree, under the existing system, to the patriation of the Constitution and to an amending formula as long as the whole issue of the distribution of powers has not been settled and Quebec has not been guaranteed all the powers it needs for its development." [...] As such, Quebec's government refused to approve the new Canadian constitution a year later. This failure to approve was a highly symbolic act, but one without direct legal consequence as no one questions the authority of the Canadian Constitution within Quebec.|$|R
