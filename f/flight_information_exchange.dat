50|$|The Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM) is {{designed}} to enable the management and distribution of weather data in digital format (XML). WXXM version 2.0, set to be finalized in 2014, is based on Geography Markup Language (GML) {{and is one of}} the GML Application Schemas. It is being developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). WXXM is a member of a family of data models designed for use in aviation safety, notably Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) and the <b>Flight</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Exchange</b> Model (FIXM).|$|E

This information is highly dynamic and therefore requires an approach beyond the request/reply MEP as provided by classic data services like the OGC WFS.|$|E

These characteristics are mainly ruled by the principle of “landing like an aircraft at an airport” (XCOR, 2015) (DreamChaser, 2015) (Spaceliner, 2015). This directly generates the need to be taken in a system wide information management (SWIM) consideration because of the fact, that all the future air traffic participants are requested to act as SWIM communicating sub-systems by the future Single European Sky Air Traffic Manamement Research (SESAR) SWIM "Intranet for ATM" concept. The presented solution is a SpacecraftReentryHazardAreaService via SWIM whereby an interested client submits the data of an approaching spacecraft in <b>Flight</b> <b>Information</b> <b>eXchange</b> Model (FIXM) format and gets back the potential hazard area as an Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) formatted Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) providing information on the airspace affected and the associated dimensions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance.

40|$|Mobile cyber-physical systems (M-CPSs) are envisaged as an {{integral}} part of our digital future.

40|$|Coordination–or the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> among {{physicians}} and hospital staff–is necessary for desirable patient outcomes in healthcare delivery. However, coordination {{is difficult because}} healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i. e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations context–use of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i. e. Electronic Health Records systems) by {{physicians and}} hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employment–influence <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship to provider-patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the U. S. A., we find that increased <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship drives provider-patient communication, and increased social interaction ties drives <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Social interaction ties fully mediates the relationship between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Physician employment amplifies the link between ITDR and social interaction ties, but {{does not have an}} effect on the link between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We do not find a direct relationship between ITDR, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship or provider-patient communication...|$|R

Recent {{internationalisation}} {{effort of}} the Swedish Armed Forces has led to rapidly increased demand on interoperability in general and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in particular.

Nevertheless, the challenge of connecting systems turns {{out not to be}} only a matter of technical issues but also semantic (unique interpretation of information) and organisational (<b>information</b> <b>exchanged</b> is efficiently used) ones. In order to provide a domain specific model within a particular context we need an adaptive methodology that deals with how to build an <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> model based upon <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> requirements. By having a uniquely defined method to build the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> models we can provide a timely and resource efficient <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> This paper presents a methodology that is a first step towards meeting the challenges mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Title: <b>Information</b> <b>exchange</b> with {{professionals}} in dementia decision-making: views of informal caregivers Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. The majority lives at home and are largely dependent of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and support. This creates unnecessary stress in informal caregivers. Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> enabling informal caregivers to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of {{professionals in}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> between informal caregivers and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of informal caregivers of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. Informal caregivers were positive about <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of actively involved professionals. The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by informal caregivers with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making, to ensure informal caregivers are equal partners in decision-making...|$|R
