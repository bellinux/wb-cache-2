A clear sign of Molotov's {{precarious}} position was {{his inability to}} prevent the arrest in December 1948 for [...] "treason" [...] of his Jewish wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, whom Stalin had long distrusted. Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make <b>dinner</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> every evening to remind him that, in his own words, [...] "she suffered because of me".|$|E

60|$|That's {{as far as}} that {{collection}} got.

6000|$|She was consoled {{for that}} time; but the perplexity continued. She strove {{to reduce the}} {{ordinary}} expenditure, but Arthur had a fashion of bringing home a friend to dinner without notice; and she underwent indescribable miseries, while reflecting on her one chicken, or five mutton chops; and though something was sure to be extemporized by the cook, {{the result was that}} these casual guests were as expensive as a banquet. She ventured to beg Arthur to tell her when he was going to ask any one, but he was vexed, and said he liked to bring home a man by chance; there need be nothing out of the common way, and a <b>dinner</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> was a dinner for three.

60|$|After an {{interval}} of some weeks, during which Harry had been down at Clavering and had returned again {{to his work}} at the Adelphi, Count Pateroff called again in Bloomsbury Square; but Harry was at Mr. Beilby's office. Harry at once returned the count's visit at the address given in Mount Street. Madame was at home, said the servant-girl, from which Harry was led to suppose that the count was a married man; but Harry felt that he had no right to intrude upon madame, so he simply left his card. Wishing, however, really to have this interview, and having been lately elected at a club of which he was rather proud, he wrote to the count asking him to dine with him at the Beaufort. He explained that there was a stranger's room--which Pateroff knew very well, having often dined at the Beaufort--and said something as to a private little <b>dinner</b> <b>for</b> <b>two,</b> thereby apologizing for proposing to the count to dine without other guests. Pateroff accepted the invitation, and Harry, never having done such a thing before, ordered his dinner with much nervousness.|$|E

60|$|She {{was eight}} when her mother’s death made her {{mistress}} {{of the house and}} mother to her little brother, and from that time she scrubbed and mended and baked and sewed, and argued with the flesher about the quarter pound of beef and penny bone which provided <b>dinner</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> days (but if you think that this was poverty you don’t know the meaning of the word), and she carried the water from the pump, and had her washing-days and her ironings and a stocking always on the wire for odd moments, and gossiped like a matron with the other women, and humoured the men with a tolerant smile—all these things she did as a matter of course, leaping joyful from bed in the morning because there was so much to do, doing it as thoroughly and sedately as if the brides were already due for a lesson, and then rushing out in a fit of childishness to play dumps or palaulays with others of her age. I see her frocks lengthening, though they were never very short, and the games given reluctantly up. The horror of my boyhood was that I knew a time would come when I also must give up the games, and how it was to be done I saw not (this agony still returns to me in dreams, when I catch myself playing marbles, and look on with cold displeasure); I felt that I must continue playing in secret, and I took this shadow to her, when she told me her own experience, which convinced us both that we were very like each other inside. She had discovered that work is the best fun after all, and I learned it in time, but have my lapses, and so had she.|$|E
