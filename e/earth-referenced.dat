40|$|This Annual Interim Report {{summarizes}} the activities led by Raytheon, {{in collaboration with}} GE Aviation and SAIC, and presents the results obtained {{during the first year}} of this research effort to expand the RNP concept to 4 dimensions relative to a dynamic frame of reference. Joint Program Development Office (JPDO) Concepts of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) considers 4 Dimension Trajectory (4 DT) procedures a key enabler to Trajectory Based Operations (TBO). The JPDO defines 4 DT as a precise description of an aircraft path in space and time. While NextGen assumes that this path is defined within an <b>Earth-reference</b> frame, many 4 DT procedure implementations will require an aircraft to precisely navigate relative to a moving reference such as another aircraft to form aggregate flows or a weather cell to allow for flows to shift. Current methods of implementing routes and flight paths rely on aircraft meeting a Required Navigation Performance (RNP) specification and being equipped with a monitoring and alerting capability to annunciate when the aircraft system is unable to meet the performance specification required for the operation. Since all aircraft today operate within the NAS relative to fixed reference points, the current RNP definition is deemed satisfactory. However, it is not well understood how the current RNP construct will support NextGen 4 DT procedures where aircraft operate relative to each other or to other dynamic frames of reference. The objective of this research effort is to analyze candidate 4 DT procedures from both an Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and aircraft perspective, to identify their specific navigational requirements, assess the shortcomings of the current RNP construct to meet these requirements, to propose an extended 4 Dimensional Dynamic RNP (4 D Dynamic RNP) construct that accounts for the dynamic spatial and temporal nature of the selected 4 DT procedures, and finally, to design an experiment using the Airspace and Traffic Operations Simulation (ATOS) system to validate the 4 D Dynamic RNP construct. This Annual Interim Report {{summarizes the}} activities led by Raytheon, in collaboration with GE Aviation and SAIC, and presents the results obtained {{during the first year of}} this research effort to expand the RNP concept to 4 dimensions relative to a dynamic frame of reference. A comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art international implementation of current RNP was completed and presented in the Contractor Report RNP State-of-the-Art Assessment, Version 4, 17 December 2008.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{data processing}} schemes for extracting <b>Earth-referenced</b> current velocity from relative current velocity measurement {{made by an}} Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) borne by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Compared with conventional approaches, current profiling from an AUV platform has advantages including three-dimensional mobility, rapid response, high-level intelligent control, independence from ship motion and weather constraint, and shallow water operation. First, an acausal postprocessing scheme is presented for estimating the AUV's own velocity and removing it from the relative velocity measurement to obtain the true current velocity. Then, a causal scheme for estimating the <b>Earth-referenced</b> current velocity is presented. The causal algorithm {{is based on an}} Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that utilizes the hydrodynamics connecting current velocity to vehicle's motion. In both methods, the raw ADCP measurement is corrected to achieve more accurate current velocity estimate. Field data from the Haro Strait Tidal Front Experiment are processed by both methods. Current velocity estimation results reveal horizontal and vertical velocity structure of the tidal mixing process, and are also consistent with the vehicle's deviated trajectory. The capability of the AUV-borne current profiling system is thus demonstrated. by Yanwu Zhang. Thesis (S.

40|$|SummaryThe {{ability to}} orient and {{navigate}} through the terrestrial environment represents a computational challenge {{common to all}} vertebrates. It arises because motion sensors in the inner ear, the otolith organs, and the semicircular canals transduce self-motion in an egocentric reference frame. As a result, vestibular afferent information reaching the brain is inappropriate for coding our own motion and orientation relative to the outside world. Here we show that cerebellar cortical neuron activity in vermal lobules 9 and 10 reflects the critical computations of transforming head-centered vestibular afferent information into <b>earth-referenced</b> self-motion and spatial orientation signals. Unlike vestibular and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, where a mixture of responses was observed, Purkinje cells represent a homogeneous population that encodes inertial motion. They carry the earth-horizontal component of a spatially transformed and temporally integrated rotation signal from the semicircular canals, which is critical for computing head attitude, thus isolating inertial linear accelerations during navigation...|$|E
40|$|Airborne wind {{measurement}} techniques currently being used onboard the National Aeronautical Establishment (NAE) Twin Otter Atmospheric Research Aircraft are described and their fundamental limitations are discussed. In particular, a recently acquired LTN- 90 - 100 strapdown Inertial Reference System (IRS) exhibits significant low frequency errors in its velocity components (primarily Schuler oscillation errors that can attain peak values of 2 to 3 m s 2 ̆ 2121), actually degrading wind computation accuracy compared with older techniques. A new {{wind measurement}} technique, {{based on a}} Kalman filter integrated navigation approach, is shown to mitigate this problem and provide wind computation accuracy superior to previous methods. Preliminary results, based on applying the Kalman filter to Twin Otter flight test data, indicate that inertial velocity accuracies of 0. 3 m s 2 ̆ 2121 rms (per axis) are attainable under ideal conditions, with a corresponding improvement in the accuracy of <b>earth-referenced</b> wind components.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} new {{modality}} for direct measurement of ocean flow, achieved {{by combining the}} resolution and precision of an acoustic Doppler velocimeter with the mobility of an autonomous underwater vehicle. To obtain useful measurements, two practical integration issues must first be resolved: the optimal location for mounting the velocimeter probe to the vehicle, and alignment of the velocimeter with the vehicle’s attitude sensors. Next, it is shown how to extract <b>earth-referenced</b> flow velocities from the raw measurements. Vehicle hull’s influence on flow velocity measurement is removed by modeling the vehicle as a spheroid in potential flow. This approach was verified by a tow tank experiment in the David Taylor Model Basin. The authors then describe mission configuration and signal processing for a deployment in the Labrador Sea to study deep ocean convection {{during the winter of}} 1998. Analysis of the vertical flow velocity data not only shows that this form of measurement can detect ocean convection, but also gives detailed information about convection’s spatial structure. 1...|$|E
40|$|The GOCE {{satellite}} measures {{gravity gradients}} which are filtered and transformed to gradients in an <b>Earth-referenced</b> frame by the GOCE High Level processing Facility. More than 32, 000, 000 data with 6 components {{are available from}} the period 2009 - 2011. IAG Arctic gravity project data was used north of 83 deg., while data from Antarctica was not used due to bureaucratic restrictions by the data-holders. Subsets of the data have been used to produce gridded values at 10 km altitude of gravity anomalies and vertical gravity gradients in 20 × 20 deg. blocks with 10 ' spacing. Various combinations and densities of data were used to obtain and compare values in areas with known gravity anomalies. The (marginally) best choice was vertical gravity gradients selected with an approximate 0. 125 deg. spacing. Using Least-Squares Collocation, error-estimates were computed and compared to the difference between the GOCE-grids and grids derived from EGM 2008 to deg. 512. In general a good agreement was found, however with some inconsistencies in certain areas. The computation time on a usual server with 24 processors was typically 50 minutes for a block with generally 40, 000 GOCE vertical gradients as input. The computations will be updated with new Wiener-filtered data in the near future...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAlignment of {{the body}} to the {{gravitational}} vertical is considered to be the key to human bipedalism. However, changes to the semicircular canals during human evolution [1 – 3] suggest that the sense of head rotation that they provide is important for modern human bipedal locomotion. When walking, the canals signal a mix of head rotations associated with path turns, balance perturbations, and other body movements. It is uncertain how the brain uses this information. Here, we show dual roles for the semicircular canals in balance control and navigation control. We electrically evoke a head-fixed virtual rotation signal from semicircular canal nerves [4 – 6] as subjects walk in the dark with their head held in different orientations. Depending on head orientation, we can either steer walking by “remote control” or produce balance disturbances. This shows that the brain resolves the canal signal according to head posture into <b>Earth-referenced</b> orthogonal components and uses rotations in vertical planes to control balance and rotations in the horizontal plane to navigate. Because the semicircular canals are concerned with movement rather than detecting vertical alignment, this result shows the importance of movement control and agility rather than precise vertical alignment {{of the body}} for human bipedalism...|$|E
40|$|Lightning {{discharges}} generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak {{component in}} the very low frequency (VLF; 3 - 30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (<= 6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms {{in a set of}} waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1 - 4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between similar to 40 and 60 % is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an <b>Earth-referenced</b> channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{and demonstrates}} methods of classifying ocean processes using an underwater moving platform {{such as an}} Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The "mingled spectrum principle" is established which concisely relates observations from a moving platform to the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the ocean process. It clearly reveals {{the role of the}} AUV speed in mingling temporal and spatial information. For classifying different processes, an AUV is not only able to jointly utilize the time-space information, but also at a tunable proportion by adjusting its cruise speed. In this respect, AUVs are advantageous compared with traditional oceanographic platforms. Based on the mingled spectrum principle, a parametric tool for designing an AUVbased spectral classifier is developed. An AUV's controllable speed tunes the separability between the mingled spectra of different processes. This property is the key to optimizing the classifier's performance. As a case study, AUV-based classification is applied to distinguish ocean convection from internal waves. The mingled spectrum templates are derived from the MIT Ocean Convection Model and the Garrett-Munk internal wave spectrum model. To allow for mismatch between modeled templates and real measurements, the AUVbased classifier is designed to be robust to parameter uncertainties. By simulation tests on the classifier, it is demonstrated that at a higher AUV speed, convection's distinct spatial feature is highlighted to the advantage of classification. Experimental data are used to test the AUV-based classifier. An AUV-borne flow measurement system is designed and built, using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The system is calibrated in a high-precision tow tank. In February 1998, the AUV acquired field data of flow velocity in the Labrador Sea Convection Experiment. The <b>Earth-referenced</b> vertical flow velocity is extracted from the raw measurements. The classification test result detects convection's occurrence, a finding supported by more traditional oceanographic analyses and observations. The thesis work provides an important foundation for future work in autonomous detection and sampling of oceanographic processes. by Yanwu Zhang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanisms of human adaptation to rotating environments, we exposed 19 healthy subjects and 8 vestibular-deficient subjects ("abnormal"; four bilateral and four unilateral lesions) to an interaural centripetal acceleration of 1 g (resultant 45 degrees roll-tilt of 1. 4 g) on a 0. 8 -m-radius centrifuge for periods of 90 min. The subjects sat upright (body z-axis parallel to centrifuge rotation axis) in the dark with head stationary, except during 4 min of every 10 min, when they performed head saccades toward visual targets switched on at 3 - to 5 -s intervals at random locations (within +/- 30 degrees) in the earth-horizontal plane. Eight of the normal subjects also performed the head saccade protocol in a stationary chair adjusted to a static roll-tilt angle of 45 degrees for 90 min (reproducing the change in orientation but not {{the magnitude of the}} gravitoinertial force on the centrifuge). Eye movements, including voluntary saccades directed along perceived earth- and head-referenced planes, were recorded before, during, and immediately after centrifugation. Postural center of pressure (COP) and multisegment body kinematics were also gathered before and within 10 min after centrifugation. Normal subjects overestimated roll-tilt during centrifugation and revealed errors in perception of head-vertical provided by directed saccades. Errors in this perceptual response tended to increase with time and became significant after approximately 30 min. Motion-sickness symptoms caused approximately 25 % of normal subjects to limit their head movements during centrifugation and led three normal subjects to stop the test early. Immediately after centrifugation, subjects reported feeling tilted 10 degrees in the opposite direction, which was in agreement with the direction of their <b>earth-referenced</b> directed saccades. Postural COP, segmental body motion amplitude, and hip-sway frequency increased significantly after centrifugation. These postural effects were short-lived, however, with a recovery time of several postural test trials (minutes). There were also asymmetries in the direction of postcentrifugation COP and head tilt which depended on the subject's orientation during the centrifugation adaptation period (left ear or right ear out). The amount of total head movements during centrifugation correlated poorly or inversely with postcentrifugation postural stability, and the most unstable subject made no head movements. There was no decrease in postural stability after static tilt, although these subjects also reported a perceived tilt briefly after return to upright, and they also had COP asymmetries. Abnormal subjects underestimated roll-tilt during centrifugation, and their directed saccades revealed permanent spatial distortions. Bilateral abnormal subjects started out with poor postural control, but showed no postural decrements after centrifugation, while unilateral abnormal subjects had varying degrees of postural decrement, both in their everyday function {{and as a result of}} experiencing the centrifugation. In addition, three unilateral, abnormal subjects, who rode twice in opposite orientations, revealed a consistent orthogonal pattern of COP offsets after centrifugation. These results suggest that both orientation and magnitude of the gravitoinertial vector are used by the central nervous system for calibration of multiple orientation systems. A change in the background gravitoinertial force (otolith input) can rapidly initiate postural and perceptual adaptation in several sensorimotor systems, independent of a structured visual surround...|$|E
