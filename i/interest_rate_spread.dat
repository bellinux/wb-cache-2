40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{macroeconomic}} determinants of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> in Ghana for the period 1980 - 2013. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive distributed lag bounds test approach to cointegration and the error correction model were used for the estimation. Findings: The results indicate that exchange rate volatility, fiscal deficit, economic growth, and public sector borrowing from commercial banks, increase <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> in Ghana in both the long and short run. Institutional quality reduces <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> in the long run while lending <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility and monetary policy <b>rate</b> reduce <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> in the short run. Research limitations/implications: The depreciation of the Ghana cedi must be controlled since its volatility increases spreads. There is a need for fiscal discipline since fiscal deficits increase <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads.</b> Government must reduce its domestic borrowing because the associated crowding-out effect increases <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads.</b> The central bank must improve its monitoring and regulation of the financial sector in order to reduce spreads. Originality/value: The main novelty of the paper (compared to other studies on Ghana) lies on the one hand; analysing macroeconomic determinants of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> and, on the other hand, controlling for the impact of institutional quality on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> in Ghana...|$|R

Therefore, warehouse funding allows the loan originators to provide mortgages at more competitive rates.

50|$|During 2007, as {{negative}} information about U.S. residential mortgages spreads out, securities backed with mortgages, including sub-prime mortgages, widely held by ABCP programs of financial firms globally, started {{to lose their}} value. ABCP investors started {{to worry about the}} value of the asset backing their ABCP and stopped rolling over their position. At the beginning, sponsor banks have enough liquid to pay off these liabilities, but lack of market confidence can create a subprime mortgage crisis. On August 2007, the French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three funds invested in ABCP and suspended calculation of net asset values. Even though defaults on mortgages had been rising throughout 2007, the suspension of withdrawals by BNP Paribas has a profound effect on ABCP market. The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread</b> of over-night ABCP and Federal funds rate increased from 10 basis points to 150 basis points within one day of announcement.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} bank <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> {{is central to}} our {{understanding}} of the process of financial intermediation. Data limitations generally restrict empirical analyses to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> that are constructed from bank income statements and balance sheets. In this paper we make use of a data set that allows us directly to compute <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> based on individual bank loan and deposit rates reported on a monthly basis to the Central Bank of Chile. The information is disaggregated by unit of account (peso, inflation-indexed, and dollar) over the period 1994 - 2001. We find that the estimated impacts of industry concentration, business cycle variables, and monetary policy variables differ markedly between <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> based on balance sheet data and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> based on disaggregated loan and deposit data. Since empirical work on interest spreads is used for guiding policy recommendations, these findings have important implications for the interpretation of interest spreads regressions. Our analysis calls for some caution in the interpretation of estimated empirical determinants of bank spreads that are constructed from income statements and balance sheet data. At the same time, our analysis shows how information from the two types of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spreads</b> can be combined to create a more complete portrait of bank behavior than either type alone is capable of creating. The results for Chile suggest the potential importance of gathering such disaggregated data in other countries. ...|$|R

50|$|Lárus E. Sveinbjörnsson, a {{high court}} judge, worked {{part-time}} {{as the first}} {{managing director of the}} bank, as did its comptroller and cashier. The first spring after it opened, the Bank was augmented by the acquisition of the assets and goodwill of the Reykjavík Savings Bank (Sparisjóður Reykjavíkur), the largest in the country. By far the greatest share of the bank’s operating capital was invested in long-term mortgages; its only services consisted of accepting deposits and granting loans. The bank was a profit-making venture; its costs were low and its low-risk loans granted with a hefty <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread.</b> Soon it had managed to collect a sizeable reserve, but its impact was less than hoped for. Residents living outside of Reykjavík soon complained that there were no signs of the local branches promised in the parliamentary statute. The capital’s own citizens were far from satisfied with having the bank open only for several hours, two days a week and in 1889 daily opening hours were introduced. Two years later, the wages of the bank’s employees were raised to reflect their longer working hours, making them Iceland’s first banking professionals. In 1893 Lárus Sveinbjörnsson consequently returned to the High Court and a full-time managing director, Tryggvi Gunnarsson, was appointed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the trend of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread</b> in Malawi and {{establish}} if any association exists between economic growth (measured by real GDP) and the spreads. The study adds to the existing literature in that it analyses in detail the factors that cause wider interest rate spreads in Malawi and other developing countries, and provides suggestions on alternatives to adopt in order to narrow the spreads. The study further establishes a link between a country’s economic growth and its real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread</b> as provided by the commercial banks in Malawi. Using a correlation and regression analysis on data ranging from 2006 to 2014 derived from a sample of Malawian banks, the results suggest that in small economies, the banking sector’s over reliance on interest income is significantly correlated with wide interest rate spreads and therefore if commercial banks come up with other revenue generation avenues, other than leaning wholly on interest revenue, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread</b> can be narrowed; and that the wider spreads so far recorded have a reasonable contribution to the malfunctioning economy.

We delineate the Norwegian bank market into local commuter belts, and define the commuter belts as either high- or low concentration regions depending on their level of market concentration, measured by the Herfindahl- Hirschman Index (HHI). Regions with HHI-levels above 0. 20 are defined as high concentration regions whereas regions with HHI-levels equal to and below 0. 20 are defined as low concentration regions. We analyze how market concentration along with other potential determinants affect the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>spread</b> of banks in both high- and low concentration regions over the years 1998 – 2008 using panel data regression methods.
