5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E

For patient who has selective <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency, the reaction is presumed {{to be caused by}} IgA antibodies in the donor's plasma. The patient may presented with symptoms of fever, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and circulatory shock. Urgent treatment with epinephrine is needed.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{review of}} the {{toxicity}} of tea tree oil concluded {{that it may be}} used externally in its diluted form by the majority of individuals without adverse effect (provided oxidation is avoided). Topical application of tea tree oil can cause adverse reactions at high concentration. Adverse effects can include skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, systemic contact dermatitis, linear <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> disease, erythema multiforme like reactions, and systemic hypersensitivity reactions.|$|E
25|$|The disease derives {{its name}} from {{deposits}} of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA) in a granular pattern in the mesangium (by immunofluorescence), a region of the renal glomerulus. The mesangium by light microscopy may be hypercellular and show increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In terms of the renal manifestation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, {{it has been found}} that although it shares the same histological spectrum as IgA nephropathy, a greater frequency of severe lesions such as glomerular necrosis and crescents were observed. Correspondingly, HSP nephritis has a higher frequency of glomerular staining for fibrin compared with IgAN, but with an otherwise similar immunofluorescence profile.|$|E

25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or sacroiliitis occurs in 15–30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling arthritis, heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing spondylitis, <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive arthritis can expect to live normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years.|$|E
25|$|Positive {{emotions}} {{not only}} have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A,</b> a vital system antibody, which serves as the body’s {{first line of defense}} in respiratory illnesses. Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient’s stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.|$|E

40|$|Previously, we {{constructed}} a chimeric influenza virus that expresses the highly conserved {{amino acid sequence}} ELDKWA of gp 41 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Antisera elicited in mice by infection with this chimeric virus showed neutralizing activity against distantly related HIV- 1 isolates (T. Muster, R. Guinea, A. Trkola, M. Purtscher, A. Klima, F. Steindl, P. Palese, and H. Katinger, J. Virol. 68 : 4031 - 4034, 1994). In the present study, we demonstrated that intranasal immunizations with this chimeric virus are also able to induce a humoral immune response at the mucosal level. The immunized mice had ELDKWA-specific <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>A</b> in respiratory, intestinal, and vaginal secretions. Sustained levels of these secretory <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>A</b> were detectable for more than 1 year after immunization. The results show that influenza virus {{can be used to}} efficiently induce secretory antibodies against antigens from foreign pathogens. Since long-lasting mucosal immunity in the genital and intestinal tracts might be essential for protective immunity against HIV- 1, influenza virus appears to be a promising vector for HIV- 1 -derived immunogens...|$|R
2500|$|Protease Secretion: Blastocystis secretes a {{protease}} {{that breaks}} up antibodies produced and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract lumen. These antibodies, known as <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA), {{make up the}} immune defense system of human by preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms {{in the body and}} by neutralizing toxins secreted by these microorganisms. By breaking up the antibodies, it allows the persistence of Blastocystis in the human gut. Another more recent study has also shown and proposed [...] that, in response to the proteases secreted by Blastocystis, the intestinal host cells would signal a series of events to be carried out, eventually leading to the self-destruction of the host cells – a phenomenon known as apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} of breast milk changes {{depending on how}} long the baby nurses at each session, {{as well as on}} the child's age. The first type, produced during the first days after childbirth, is called colostrum. [...] Colostrum is easy to digest although it is more concentrated than mature milk. [...] It has a laxative effect that helps the infant to pass early stools, aiding in the excretion of excess bilirubin, which helps to prevent jaundice. It also helps to seal the infants gastrointestional tract from foreign substances, which may sensitize the baby to foods that the mother has eaten. Although the baby has received some antibodies through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>A</b> (IgA).
