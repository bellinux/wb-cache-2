Olivia gives him {{an address to}} a [...] "safe house" [...] in a suburban area, and, once there, thanks him and allows him to go. However, Henry remains parked on a nearby street. In the home, Olivia discovers her mother Marilyn (Amy Madigan), who, in the prime universe, had died when Olivia was a teenager. Olivia, seeing her mother and the memories of her mother, cries into her arms, as she <b>is</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> Fauxlivia's memories. By the time Charlie arrives, Olivia fully believes she is Fauxlivia, and after saying goodbye to her mother, returns willingly with Charlie to Fringe headquarters. Henry, after watching Charlie's car pull away, drives off on his own.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{was able}} to raise its foreign debt because, at the time, the {{international}} financial system <b>was</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> petrodollars and <b>was</b> eagerly offering low-interest loans. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, however, the foreign debt had reached high levels. Additionally, the marked increase of international interest rates raised the debt service, forcing the country to borrow more only to meet interest payments. Productive capacity, exports, and the substitution of imports in various sectors expanded and became more diversified. However, the expected impacts on Brazil's current account were not to materialize until the mid-1980s.|$|R

She left the Adriatic in January 1917 for a refit at Gibraltar, during which the 6-inch (152-mm) guns on her main deck were replaced with four 6-inch (152-mm) guns a deck higher because the original guns <b>were</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> even slightly rough weather.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "Autophysiopsychic is {{probably}} the single album that many Yusef Lateef fans either love or hate the most... five fat slices of original funk that have far {{more in common with}} the sounds of Chocolate City than with the bop sounds of 52nd Street. Autophysiopsychic <b>is</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> the soft soul-funk-jazz sound typical of Creed Taylor's (CTI) productions in the 1970s... Not the most typical album in Lateef's wide-ranging catalog, but certainly the most fun".|$|E

40|$|That {{the lending}} channel {{is alive and}} well for {{consumer}} lending is at first glance a compelling notion given the growth in consumer credit. However, this paper demonstrates with disaggregated monthly and quarterly consumer credit data that households <b>are</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> liquidity. Contrary to assumptions motivating the lending channel, households are not constrained in accessing credit from any lender (or in any form) in response to a monetary shock. The findings of this paper have important implications for research on the monetary transmission mechanism beyond the lending channel and for business cycle research in general. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Lindsay Planer noted [...] "The {{trademark}} brash and stylistic covers {{run the gamut}} from the robust and harmonically intense opener [...] "Dancing in the Dark," [...] to the equally complex structure of the hauntingly gorgeous [...] "Sophisticated Lady." [...] There is also a remake of the Kenton classic [...] "Eager Beaver," [...] which had been his first significant hit back in 1943. Particularly notable is the exhilarating and slightly tropical rendering of [...] "Temptation," [...] which <b>is</b> <b>awash</b> <b>in</b> the chic 'space age bachelor pad' vibe of heavily provocative percussion".|$|E

50|$|In 1970, {{much of the}} newspaper's {{staff and}} then editor Brian Kirby left the paper due to {{financial}} and editorial differences. The team began a competing newspaper, The Staff.
