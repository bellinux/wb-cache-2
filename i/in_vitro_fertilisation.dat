5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilisation</b> featured {{heavily in the}} news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E

40|$|In many species, {{males and}} females mate with {{multiple}} partners, which gives rise to sperm competition and multiple paternity. The experiments on water frogs presented here demonstrate that such sperm competition can affect the structure and dynamics of mixed species communities. The hybrid frog Rana esculenta (LR) mates with one of its parental species, usually Rana lessonae (LL) although in some areas R. ridibunda (RR), to regain the premeiotically eliminated parental genome ("hybridogenesis"). Mixed LL/LR-populations are stable although hybrid numbers should continuously increase {{at the expense of}} parental animals, because of differences in female fecundity and other factors. This would finally lead to the extinction of the sexual host, followed by that of the sexual parasite, unless the reproductive superiority of R. esculenta is reduced by other factors, such as lower hybrid male fertility. Eggs from LL- and LR-females were fertilised <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> by single- and multi-male sperm suspensions of LL-, LR- and RR-males. In all experiments, the proportion of offspring sired by R. esculenta sperm was significantly lower than that sired by R. lessonae or R. ridibunda sperm. Gonad mass, sperm morphology, sperm swimming velocity, and sperm survival did not explain these differences in fertilisation success, nor did gamete recognition and compatibility. Sperm density was the only trait that paralleled fertilisation success; but it offers no explanation either, because densities were equalised for the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilisations.</b> <b>In</b> natural LL/LR populations, the significantly smaller amount, poorer competitive ability and lower long-term survival of R. esculenta compared to R. lessonae sperm will reduce the initial reproductive superiority of hybrids and contribute to the stabilisation of mixed water frog populations. Differences in fertilisation ability are also likely to be relevant for the structure and dynamics of several other systems with encounters between eggs and sperm from different genotypes, ecotypes, ploidy levels and/or species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Males {{that are}} {{successful}} in intra-sexual competition are often assumed to be of superior quality. In the mating system of most salmonid species, intensive dominance fights are common and the winners monopolise most mates and sire most offspring. We drew {{a random sample of}} mature male brown trout (Salmo trutta) from two wild populations and determined their dominance hierarchy or traits linked to dominance. The fish were then stripped and their sperm was used for <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>fertilisations</b> <b>in</b> two full-factorial breeding designs. We recorded embryo viability until hatching in both experiments, and juvenile survival during 20 months after release into a natural streamlet in the second experiment. Since offspring of brown trout get only genes from their fathers, we used offspring survival as a quality measure to test (i) whether males differ in their genetic quality, and if so, (ii) whether dominance or traits linked to dominance reveal 'good genes'. Results We found significant additive genetic variance on embryo survival, i. e. males differed in their genetic quality. Older, heavier and larger males were more successful in intra-sexual selection. However, neither dominance nor dominance indicators like body length, weight or age were significantly linked to genetic quality measured as embryo or juvenile survival. Conclusion We found no evidence that females can improve their offspring's genetic viability by mating with large and dominant males. If there still were advantages of mating with dominant males, they may be linked to non-genetic benefits or to genetic advantages that are context dependent and therefore possibly not revealed under our experimental conditions – even if we found significant additive genetic variation for embryo viability under such conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Protein is a {{fundamental}} part of nutrition in all animals but ruminants {{have the ability to}} metabolise and utilise non-protein nitrogen for this use. This allows for an economical alternative source of protein that does not compete with human resources. Previous evidence suggests that feeding high levels of protein to support increased demands for growth and production may {{have a negative impact on}} reproduction, since protein is rapidly converted to ammonia and further metabolised to urea which are both toxic to the reproductive system. Investigations within the South African climate indicated that the Nguni cow maintained higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels during periods of drought than other cattle breeds. The Nguni breed is well adapted to extreme situations but as its popularity grows and the breed is promoted for emerging farmers it becomes essential to know if it possesses adaptations which could predispose it to reproductive failure if supplemented in the same manner as other commercial breeds. In this prospective experimental study, 22 multiparous cows of two breeds, the Hereford and the Nguni, were block randomised into a cross over design whereby all animals were fed a total mixed ration (TMR). The test group was provided with an increasing rumen degradable protein content in the form of feed grade urea. The control group was maintained on a urea free TMR. In the test group, the urea inclusion rate was increased weekly by 50 g to allow for rumen microflora adaptation and prevent acute urea toxicity.

Oocyte quality was defined as the number of oocytes with cumulus cells (Grade 1 3 oocytes) harvested per OPU, and oocyte viability was defined as the number of oocytes that cleaved by day 2 or that reached at least the morula stage by day 7 <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> embryo system. Multivariable analyses were performed on BUN, antral follicle count (AFC) and number of grade 1 3 oocytes harvested per OPU session, and on the oocyte viability outcomes <b>in</b> the <b>vitro</b> embryo system. Nguni cows receiving 150 g dietary urea per day had lower mean BUN levels than Herefords (17. 5 and 19. 3 mg/dL respectively, P = 0. 02). However dietary urea inclusion level, serum albumin level and sampling day were the only independent predictors of serum BUN. Nguni cows had lower mean antral follicle count (AFC) and number of oocytes harvested than Herefords (9. 1 and 3. 1, and 11. 7 and 4. 3 respectively, P 20 mg/dL were independently associated with the number of grade 1 - 3 oocytes after adjusting for AFC and the random effect of the individual animal. Increasing weighted mean serum albumin and decreasing weighted mean beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) were independently associated with the number of oocytes that cleaved (day 2) or that reached the morula stage (day 7) (P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 08 respectively). It was concluded that increasing dietary urea, low BCS and increasing serum albumin, but not breed, were associated with increasing BUN levels in cows. It was further concluded that BUN > 20 mg/dL adversely affected the occurrence of cumulus cells around oocytes and that serum albumin and BHBA were, but neither dietary urea level nor breed was independently associated with viability of bovine oocytes in this study. Although the data were inconclusive about breed differences in protein metabolism, this study suggests that serum albumin has the potential to be used as predictor of the interaction between protein and energy metabolism and its effect on oocyte development.
