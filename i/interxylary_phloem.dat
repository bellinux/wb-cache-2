25|$|In some eudicot {{families}} (Apocynaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Thymelaeaceae), phloem also develops on {{the inner}} side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between external phloem and internal phloem or intraxylary phloem is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families (Amaranthaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Salvadoraceae), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called included phloem or <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent primary meristems gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New ray initials originated by transverse divisions of fusiform initials. Both ray and fusiform initials that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of fusiform initials was rare and in no case did ray initials originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the axial xylem parenchyma. As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced. These interxylary vascular bundles formed a network which in the upper hypocotyl united to form a continuous band between the xylem and the pith. In the crown the vascular bundles of the basal leaves are bicolateral and the internal phloem is continuous with that of the <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem...</b>|$|E
30|$|Cambial {{variants}} in Piperaceae include successive cambia, xylem in plates, xylem dispersed by parenchyma divisions, intraxylary phloem, {{included phloem}} (<b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem),</b> phloem arcs/wedges, and secondary growth of external primary vascular bundles (Metcalfe and Chalk 1985; Caballé 1993; Carlquist 1991, 2001, 2013; Isnard et al. 2003; Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005; Jacques and de Franceschi 2007; Angyalossy et al. 2012). In woody vines, certain {{segments of the}} interfascicular cambium produce secondary parenchyma whereas a fascicular cambium produces typical proportions of xylem and phloem, as in Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) (Beck 2011). The xylem is furrowed by arcs or wedges of phloem derived from portions of the cambium that produce less xylem and more phloem (Angyalossy et al. 2015). However, furrowed xylem may develop from phloem wedges or secondary parenchyma proliferation. Carlquist (1991) defined rays as having very wide, thin-walled cells with limited subdivision during secondary growth. Wide rays develop in Piperaceae, and during secondary growth, the rays do not subdivide very much. Indeed, there may be little difference between them. Wider rays in lianas allow the stems to experience torsion without sustaining damage to vessels and contribute to liana stem flexibility (Putz and Holbrook 1991). The functional significance of wider rays in these seven Piper species needs to be checked.|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{activity}} of cambium {{has been investigated}} in Salvadora persica L., one of the commonest evergrenn tree of northern India, from March, 1974 to February, 1975 in the main stem and the branch. Secondary vascular cambium behaves abnormally on the xylem side, by producing xylem and phloem in succession, resulting {{in the formation of}} <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem.</b> It has a storied (sitratified) cambium organization, comprising short fusiform and isodiametric ray initials. The fusiform initials show characteristically beaded cell walls due to the presence of primary pit fields and are uninucleate. These are highly vacuolate during the active period. The cambial activity starts in the month of March, reaches the peak in August and finally slows down in the main stem. In an young branch, however, it is initiated in March-April and reaches the peak in July and then declines till November. It once again showed an upward trend gradually. It appears that the initiation of the combial activity in this tree takes place by a hormone produced in the newly formed leaves, coupled with the high rainfall, enhanced relative humidity, optimum temperature, and short-day conditions. Size measurements for the fusiform initials showed considerable variations during the span of a year. A comparision of the organization of three types of phloem 'normal', 'included' and 'internal' occurring in this plant has also bean presented...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma, rays both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|E
40|$|Features {{in which}} Agdestis differs from Phytolaccaceae s. s. include {{presence}} of both libriform fibers and vasicentric tracheids (rather {{than one or}} the other); bands and strands of thin-walled apotracheal parenchyma (in addition to paratracheal scanty parenchyma, and raylessness (also reported for Bougainvillea of Nyctaginaceae, a family close to Phytolaccaceae). Dimorphism in vessel diameter in Agdestis (narrow vessels like libriform fibers in diameter) is attributable to the lianoid habit. Packets of crystals coarser than typical for raphides occur idioblastically in Agdestis, as do raphides in Phytolacca. ln Phytolacca and in other Phytolaccaceae, one finds an unusual feature that occurs in Agdestis: nonbordered simple perforation plates. Anatomical data support Agdestis as forming a mono- generic subfamily within Phytolaccaceae s. l. The nature of successive cambia in Agdestis is compared with those in other Phytolaccaceae and in Nyctaginaceae. A common pattern is probably present, although differences in terminology and observations obscure the pattern. The term 2 ̆ 2 <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> 2 ̆ 2 is a misnomer because conjunctive tissue is not secondary xylem as generally understood. After cessation of the cambium in the first cylinder, radial rows of cells form outside the phloem and inside the cortex; this activity may constitute a lateral meristem. Apparently within the radial rows of cells, successive cambia form; each of these cambia produce secondary phloem externally and secondary xylem internally. There {{is little or no}} cambial activity in interfascicular areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} variation in cambium in lianas in Taiwan and to aid identification of liana species, we examined the stem structure of ten species of lianas belonging to the family Fabaceae. Samples were collected mainly from southern and eastern Taiwan and were selected from plants with different stem diameters in order to compare the structural similarities of plants. The results showed that cambium had a normal appearance and stems were round in Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb., Caesalpinia crista L., and Caesalpinia minax Hance. We noted a combination of furrowed xylem and dissected xylem in Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth., shallowly furrowed xylem in Acacia caesia (L.) Willd., Centrosema pubescens Benth., and Mimosa diplotricha C. Wright ex Sauvalle, a combination of flattened stem and <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> in Entada koshunensis Hayata & Kaneh. and Entada phaseoloides (L.) Merr., and a combination of external vascular cylinder and flattened stem in Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr. Of these lianas, three species, -A. caesia, B. championii, and C. crista, -experienced two distinct developmental growth phases. We concluded that variations in cambium and xylem deposition {{are associated with the}} size of the stems. Medullary bundles occurred in the pith of P. montana, an observation that has not previously been recorded. We present the first description and photographs of these bundles and the external vascular cylinder in the pith, and it is recommended that further study of this species be conducted...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features {{of wood and}} stem anatomy are presented for 44 collections of 16 genera and 35 species ofConvolvulaceae. Markedly furrowed xylem characterizes the genera of tribe Cresseae. Successive cambia occur in 11 of the genera studied. Large patches of axial parenchyma occur in many of these; only in one species was <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> (formed internally by the cambium) observed in the parenchyma patches. Intraxylary phloem at {{the periphery of the}} pith is universal in Convolvulaceae, but newly reported is the fact that in many species, cambial activity adds secondary phloem to the intraxylary phloem strands. These cambia were also observed to add limited amounts of secondary xylem externally in Ericybe and Operculina. Fragmentation of the vascular cylinder by growth from the inner cambia leads to initiation of radially oriented cambia (ray cambia) along the ray zone where fracture occurs. Three new types of vessel restriction patterns (nonrandom distribution of vessels in wood or absence of vessels within some parts of the secondary xylem) are reported for the family (and dicotyledons). Rays are predominantly uniseriate; ray histology and quantitative vessel features show little change ontogenetically in species with successive cambia, suggesting that this cambial mode deters the kinds of progressive changes that occur in dicotyledons with a single cambium. Vessels are much wider in lianoid Convolvulaceae than in shrubby species; the lianoid species of Ipomoea have vessels twice the diameter of those in arborescent species of Ipomoea. Conjunctive parenchyma may serve for water storage in I. arborescens and other species, but this tissue and abundance of axial parenchyma in lianas might also aid flexibility and damage resistance. Septate fiber-tracheids and septate libriform fibers occur in a few species and represent tracheid dimorphism. Occurrence of tracheids together with fibriform vessel elements in woods of many Convolvulaceae suggests relationship of Convolvulaceae to Polemoniaceae and Hydrophyllaceae; intraxylary phloem and other wood features suggest relationship between Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae...|$|E
40|$|Melastomataceae {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} and diversified groups of plants throughout the tropics, but their intrafamily relationships and morphological evolution are poorly understood. Here we report the results of parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of cpDNA sequences from the rbcL and ndhF genes and the rpl 16 intron, generated for eight outgroups (Crypteroniaceae, Alzateaceae, Rhynchocalycaceae, Oliniaceae, Penaeaceae, Myrtaceae, and Onagraceae) and 54 species of melastomes. The sample represents 42 of the family’s currently recognized ~ 150 genera, the 13 traditional tribes, and the three subfamilies, Astronioideae, Melastomatoideae, and Memecyloideae (= Memecylaceae DC.). Parsimony and ML yield congruent topologies that place Memecylaceae as sister to Melastomataceae. Pternandra, a Southeast Asian genus of 15 species of which five were sampled, is the firstbranching Melastomataceae. This placement has low bootstrap support (72 %), but agrees with morphological treatments that placed Pternandra in Melastomatacaeae because of its acrodromal leaf venation, usually ranked as a tribe or subfamily. The <b>interxylary</b> <b>phloem</b> islands found in Memecylaceae and Pternandra, but not most other Melastomataceae, likely evolved in parallel because Pternandra resembles Melastomataceae in its other wood characters. A newly discovered plesiomorphic character in Pternandra, also present in Memecylaceae, is a fibrous anther endothecium. Higher Melastomataceae lack an endothecium as do the closest relatives of Melastomataceae and Memecylaceae. The next deepest split is between Astronieae, with anthers opening by slits, and all remaining Melastomataceae, which have anthers opening by pores. Within the latter, several generic groups, corresponding to traditional tribes, receive solid statistical support, but relationships among them, with one exception, are different from anything predicted on the basis of morphological data. Thus, Miconieae and Merianieae are sister groups, and both are sister to a trichotomy of Bertolonieae, Microlicieae + Melastomeae, and Dissochaeteae + Blakeeae. Sonerileae/Oxysporeae are nested within Dissochaeteae, Rhexieae within Melastomeae, and African and Asian Melastomeae within neotropical Melastomeae. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of melastome morphological evolution (and biogeography), implying, for example, that berries evolved from capsules minimally four times, stamen connectives went from dorsally enlarged to basal/ventrally enlarged, and loss of an endothecium preceded poricidal dehiscence. ...|$|E
