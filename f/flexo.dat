Amostra utilizada na pesquisa constitui-se de 780 escolares no ano de 1990 e 853 no ano 2000. Informações associadas ao crescimento foram determinadas mediante medidas de estatura e de massa corporal. Quanto à composição corporal, utilizou-se das espessuras das dobras cutâneas tricipital e subescapular. Por sua vez, desempenho motor foi determinado mediante os testes de "sentar-e-alcançar", <b>flexões</b> abdominais, flexão e extensão dos braços e salto em distância parado. Com as informações obtidas, foi possível estabelecer indicadores de tendência secular para todas as variáveis estudadas, onde se observou que os dados de 1990 foram inferiores àqueles apresentados em 2000, levando-se em consideração as variáveis antropométricas. No aspecto motor, porém, essa tendência demonstrou característica inversa. Quanto ao atendimento dos critérios relacionados à saúde nos dois momentos do estudo (1990 e 2000), foi possível evidenciar que maioria dos escolares avaliados apresentou valores abaixo dos critérios estabelecidos pela literatura especializada na áreaThe {{objective of}} this study was to analyze the indicators of secular trends in variables associated to growth, body composition and motor performance in children 7 to 14 years of age from a private school in the municipal district of Londrina, Paraná, Brazil. 780 school kids during 1990 and 853 in 2000 were the subject sample of the research. The information associated to growth was determined by height and body mass measurements. Regarding body composition, measurements of thickness of both triceps and subscapular skinfolds were used. Motor performance was determined by "sit-and-reach", sit-ups, pull-up tests, and standing long jump tests. With the information obtained, it was possible to establish relationships with regard to the indicators of secular trends as per all the studied variables, where it was then observed that the 1990 data were inferior to those presented in 2000 considering the anthropometrical variables; however, this tendency had inverse characteristics in the motor performance aspect of the research. With regard to the fulfillment of criteria related to the health of the subjects in both moments ofthe study (1990 and 2000), it was possible to evidence that the majority of the evaluated subjects presented values below the criteria established in the scientific literatur...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXTO: As informações sobre o grau de correlação entre força muscular e capacidade funcional em pacientes com doença {{arterial}} obstrutiva periférica (DAOP) são inconsistentes, além de nem sempre apresentarem protocolos que relacionem apropriadamente medidas de força muscular com desempenho. OBJETIVO: Estabelecer o nível de correlação entre força muscular e capacidade funcional em pacientes fisicamente ativos com DAOP. MÉTODOS: Doze pacientes com diagnóstico da doença e presença de claudicação intermitente participaram do estudo. Todos realizaram testes de força muscular e de caminhada. Grau de correlação entre força muscular e capacidade funcional foi avaliado pela correlação de Pearson. RESULTADOS: Dos 12 voluntários incluídos, 10 eram do sexo masculino e 2 do sexo feminino. Os participantes tinham média de idade de 63 ± 11 anos. Houve alta correlação (r = 0, 872; p = 0, 0001) entre distância percorrida no teste de deslocamento bidirecional progressivo (TDBP) e carga alcançada no teste de resistência máxima. Não se observou correlação entre distância percorrida no TDBP e tempo gasto para realização das cinco <b>flexões</b> plantares no teste de ponta de pé. CONCLUSÃO: O desempenho funcional em um grupo de pacientes com DAOP, em sua maioria fisicamente ativos, foi fortemente correlacionado com força muscular de extensores de joelho, mas não com desempenho observado funcionalmente pelo teste de ponta de pé. Futuros estudos são necessários para avaliar se força muscular de flexores plantares, mensurada de forma específica e isolada, correlaciona-se com função em pacientes com a doença. BACKGROUND: Information on {{the degree}} of correlation between muscular strength and functional capacity in subjects with peripheral obstructive arterial disease (POAD) is inconsistent and the available studies use protocols that do not adequately correlate measurements of muscular strength with performance. OBJECTIVE: to correlate muscular strength and functional capacity in physically active subjects with POAD. METHODS: Twelve subjects with PAOD and intermittent claudication were enrolled in the study. All subjects performed muscular strength and walking tests. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the level of association between these variables. RESULTS: Twelve subjects, 10 males and 2 females, were included in the study. The mean age was 63 ± 11 years. There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 872; p = 0. 0001) between the distance walked in the shuttle walk test (SWT) and the maximum load at the maximum strength test. However, there was no correlation between the distance reached in the SWT and the time spent to carry out five plantar flexions in the tiptoe test. CONCLUSION: The functional performance of a group of individuals with PAOD - most of them physically active - was strongly correlated with knee extension muscular strength, but not with performance observed at the tiptoe test. Further studies must be carried out to assess whether the muscle strength of plantar flexion, measured specifically and separately, is correlated with function in PAOD patients...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho trata da descrição e análise da concordância de número no sintagma nominal, tendo como amostra de fala a Língua Portuguesa da classe baixa da comunidade urbana de Rio Branco (Estado do Acre), sob a perspectiva da Sociolingüística Variacionista, aliada a alguns aspectos do Funcionalismo lingüístico. Após a fundamentação teórica, procedeu-se à descrição e à análise da variável lingüística Saliência fônica, subdividida em três dimensões: Processos morfofonológicos de formação do plural, Tonicidade e Número de sílabas dos itens lexicais singulares. Além disso, foram analisadas as variáveis Posição linear dos elementos no SN, Classe gramatical, Marcas precedentes e Contexto fonético/fonológico seguinte. Quanto às variáveis sociais, foram observados Sexo e Grau de escolarização, sendo este distribuído em três níveis: analfabetos, de 1 a à 4 a e de 5 a à 8 a séries. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com os de outras Ccinco investigações sobre o mesmo tema, a fim de se detectarem generalidades a respeito do comportamento do fenômeno em estudo no Português do Brasil. O fenômeno lingüístico, ora analisado, comporta-se como sincronicamente variável. A oposição presença/ausência de marcas formais de plural nos elementos flexionáveis do SN, correlacionada com as variáveis lingüísticas e sociais, indica uma tendência na direção de garantir a informação de plural no primeiro elemento do SN, e de reduzir significativamente as <b>flexões</b> nominais nos demais elementosThis work {{deals with}} the {{description}} and analysis of number agreement in the noun phrase (NP) {{in a variety of}} Brazilian Portuguese, based on a corpus of recorded oral speech of lower class inhabitants of the city of Rio Branco (the capital of Acre - a Brazilian state in the Amazon). It follows the Quantitative Sociolinguistics model of data processing combined with some aspects of the linguistic functionalistic theory. The introduction of the theoretical framework within which theinvestigation is developed is followed by the description and analysis of the linguistic variable Phonetic Saliency comprising three main dimensions: Morphophonological processes in plural formation the tonic accent Position, and Number of syllables of the lexical item in its singular form. Besides these dimensions, other linguistic factors are considered, such as, the phonetic/phonological Environment after the item, the linear Position of the constituents of the NP, the grammatical Class, and the plural Marks preceding the item under analysis. The social variables studied were Sex, individual Performance, and level of Schooling, subdivided in three categories: (a) illiterate, (b) one to four years of primary school instruction, and (c) one to four years ofhigh school instruction. The results of the analysis were then compared with those of tive other studies on the same subject in order to fmd out possible generalizations concerning the behavior of nominal agreement in Brazilian Portuguese. The correlation of linguistic and social variables with the formal marking of plural in the NP shows that agreement in the NP in Brazilian Portuguese is a case of synchronic variation rule, favoring the tendency to guarantee the presence of plural indication in the first constituent of the NP, and to significantly reduce the nominal inflection marks in the other element...|$|R
