5000|$|A New York Times review said, [...] "“Bad Monkeys,” allusions aside, {{is highly}} entertaining. It moves fast and keeps {{surprising}} you. There {{are also some}} exciting and <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>action</b> sequences that are so skillfully written I felt as if I was watching the first “Matrix” movie, which I unabashedly loved." [...] A Mostly Fiction review said, [...] "This {{is the sort of}} book I would gladly read in one sit down session if I hadn’t had to suffer annoying interruptions such as work and sleep. Believe me, this book jumps right into the middle of a gripping story and doesn’t let up until the final page." ...|$|E
40|$|Mescaline, S, 4, 6 -(CH 30) 8 C 6 H 2 CH 2 CH 2 NHz, {{is one of}} {{the active}} {{principles}} of the cacti Anhalonium lewinii (1) and Trichocenreus terschecki (2). The most striking physiological effect of mescaline is the production of both euphoria and visual color hallucinations in human subjects (3 - 6). A number of isomers of mescaline as well as mescaline-like compounds have been prepared and tested physiologically for possible <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>action</b> (6 - 12). According to Reti (13), none of these compounds causes the euphoria or the distortion in color vision which is produced by mescaline. Iwamoto and Hartung (8) have stated that these unique psychological effects {{can be attributed to the}} presence of the three vicinal methoxyl groups on the pressor-active p-phenethylamine structure. Mescaline, however, does not appear to have the pressor activity which is usually associated with this class of amines (14). Of the five possible ring-positional isomers of mescaline, only the 2, 3, 4 - (15) and 2, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenethylamines (12) have been synthesized. As a part of a program for studying the effect of changes in structure on the hallucinatin...|$|E
50|$|Lam’s {{most notorious}} film is his 1991 {{over-the-top}} gore movie Story of Ricky. Meticulously true to its source material, this {{adaptation of the}} violent manga Riki-Oh by Masahiko Takajo and Tetsuya Saruwatari combines both recent trends in Lam's filmography - high concept adaptations of Japanese comics and hyper-violent exploitation films abundant with bodily fluids. Even though the film later gained a huge cult status in the West, in its day it {{did not do so}} well in the local cinemas. It grossed only HK$ 2 147 778, whereas Lam’s previous films for Golden Harvest usually grossed around 8 to 10 million HK$. Lam’s last film to date is The Cat (1992), an <b>hallucinatory</b> mixture of <b>action,</b> horror, comedy and science fiction.|$|R
