5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A <b>drill</b> <b>set</b> from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|E

Research shows that children in such circumstances are often {{unable or unwilling to}} give their names or other identifying information. Currently in the US, there is no existing system in the public health infrastructure that exploits image-based analysis to effectively expedite reunification when children can't be identified. Working with the Children's Hospital Boston, we have engineered a system to speed reunification of children with their families, should they get separated in a disaster.

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem of the {{traditional}} drill rig in its designs and applies, the concept of the rodless drilling rig was put forward. The working and structural principles of the rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set</b> were introduced. The three-dimensional models of the rodless drilling rig and rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set</b> were built based on virtual prototype technology. A detailed analysis of the rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set’s</b> force was made, and the force statuses of one bearing board of the rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set</b> in all directions were given out. By the rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set’s</b> prototype test, the displacement curve was achieved, which indicates the working and structural principles of the rodless <b>drilling</b> <b>set</b> are correct, and its operation is reliable as well...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{currently}} exist several training modules {{to improve}} performance during video-assisted surgery. The unique characteristics of robotic surgery make these platforms an inadequate environment for the development and assessment of robotic surgical performance. Methods: Expert surgeons (n= 4) (greater than 50 clinical robotic procedures and greater than 2 years of clinical robotic experience) were compared to novice surgeons (n= 17) (less than 5 clinical cases and limited laboratory experience) using the da Vinci Surgical System. Seven drills were designed to simulate clinical robotic surgical tasks. Performance score wascalculated by the equation Time to Completion + (minor error) x 5 + (major error) x 10. The Robotic Learning Curve (RLC) was expressed as a trend line of the performance scores corresponding to each repeated drill. Results: Performance scores for experts were better than novices in all 7 drills (p less than 0. 05). The RLC for novices reflected an improvement in scores (p less than 0. 05). In contrast, experts demonstrated a flat RLC for 6 drills and an improvement in one drill (p= 0. 027). Conclusion: This new <b>drill</b> <b>set</b> provides a framework for performance assessment during robotic surgery. The inclusion of particular drills and their role in training robotic surgeons of the future awaits larger validation studies...|$|E

During the first one, the finishing line is in a supra-gingival position, during the second one, the limit is gradually brought in an intrasulcular position. The aim of this work is to replace the diamond <b>drill</b> <b>set</b> on a turbine by diamond tips held on an ultrasonic manual tool during the second stage of preparation. As a consequence, we are going to give a survey on the preparation techniques {{as well as on the}} ultrasounds and their field of use in odontology. Then, we will describe the appliance and mainly the two types of ultrasonic inserts that have been worked out (first generation and second generation) as well as the experimental proceedings which will guide us during all our research. At this stage, we will assess the machining efficiency of these inserts on various materials such as dentine and according to two configurations : manually with several operators or on a machine. We will then study the surface layer generated by such a tooling not only from a qualitative point of view (scanning electron microscopy) but also from a quantitative point of view (mechanic and optical profilometries). We will then propose a new programme of preparation in which diamond ultrasonic inserts will be integrated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Too {{develop a}} {{flexible}} drill device {{that can be}} inserted into the shoulder joint so that arthro-scopic transosseous suture repair for Bankart lesion is possible. Materials and Methods: We created a device composed of a flexible drill unit and a guide pipe unit. The flexible drill unit was made of flexible multifilament wires (1. 2 mm in diameter) that was twisted into one cord {{so that it can}} flex in any direction and a drill bit (1. 2 mm in diameter) that is attached onto one end of the flexible wire. The guide pipe unit was a 150 mm long metal pipe (2. 0 mm in inner diameter and 3. 0 mm in outer diameter), with one end bent to 30 degrees. The flexible <b>drill</b> <b>set</b> was inserted into the shoul-der joint through the posterior portal of the joint. The guide pipe component was placed onto the medial wall of the glenoid so that the pipe was placed 5 mm posterior to the margin of the anterior glenoid rim. The flexible drill was driven through the glenoid by the power drill so that holes were made in the gle-noid. A non- absorbable suture was passed through the hole. Tying of a sliding knot tying was accom-plished over the capsule and labrum after making a stitch through the capsule and labrum with a suture hook loaded with suture passer.

40|$|Asymmetry {{is applied}} to a {{heavy-duty}} commercial twin caliper disc brake rotor {{as a means to}} alleviate an undesirable high amplitude noise. The problematic frequency is 2400 Hz, the rotor blade exhibiting a 5 - diametric mode order of vibration. The asymmetry is introduced by <b>drilling</b> <b>sets</b> of radial holes into the disc rim. Modal analysis is carried out over a range of frequencies using added masses applied magnetically to the rim of the rotor. This shows the amplitudes at set frequencies to reduce considerably when asymmetry is introduced. When a set of 5 masses is added to the rotor the vibration amplitude at the troublesome frequency is seen to be considerably reduced. Finite element analysis complements the experimental results. The analysis of a plain disc initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes. This is also accompanied by a distinct positioning of the antinodes with the antinodes of one mode positioning at the <b>sets</b> of <b>drilled</b> holes, the other mode antinodes being between the holes. When an asymmetric disc is fitted to the vehicle the noise is eradicated. Significant testing of the vehicle has since been undertaken without noise being generate...|$|R
40|$|In his monumental master work ‘The Face of the Earth’, {{the eminent}} Vienna {{geologist}} Eduard Suess has formulated visionary thoughts on fundamental topics {{ranging from the}} tectonic nature of Europe’s margins {{to the role of}} the ‘Biosphere’, a word that he had coined in 1875. This word turned into a concept of Life as a Geological Force through the vision of Vladimir I. Vernadksy (Biosfera, 1920). Recent studies (Vasconselos et al. 1995) have unveiled the possible role of microbial mediation in the formation of natural dolomite, a mineral named after Déodat de Dolomieu (1750 - 1801). But some of the most spectacular geological bodies, built by Life as a Geological Force, are the carbonate mounds. Carbonate mounds from the fossil record provide evidence of microbial mediation in the mound build-up and stabilization (Henriet et al. 2002).

Information was sought about their knowledge and behaviours in relation to delivering training programs, including their uptake of the latest scientific evidence for injury prevention. Direct observation of a sample of the coach-delivered training sessions was also undertaken to validate the questionnaire. Coaches ranked training session elements directly related to the game as being of most importance. They strongly favoured warming-up and cooling-down as injury prevention measures but changing direction and side-stepping training was considered to be of little/no importance for safety.
