40|$|Epidemiological {{and animal}} studies have {{suggested}} that a high ratio of n- 3 <b>fish</b> <b>fatty</b> acids to arachidonic acid (AA), might protect against colorectal carcinogenesis. Competition of n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids, especially AA, for the enzyme cyclooxygenase- 2 may be responsible for this effect. To examine the relation between fish intake and colorectal adenomas, data from a Dutch case-control study were analysed. All 52 cases and 57 controls filled out a food questionnaire, underwent a full colonic examination and have had a fat biopsy from the buttock. Intake of <b>fish</b> and <b>fish</b> <b>fatty</b> acids was inversely associated with colorectal adenomas although not statistically significant. For the ratio of <b>fish</b> <b>fatty</b> acids to AA, the ORs {{in the second and third}} tertile were 1. 2 and 0. 8 (p-trend = 0. 78). Tissue levels of <b>fish</b> <b>fatty</b> acids were inversely associated and tissue levels of AA were positively associated with adenomas, although not statistically significant. However, the OR for the ratio of <b>fish</b> <b>fatty</b> acids to AA was 0. 2 in the second and third tertile (p-trend = 0. 002).
