Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E

2500|$|Kirk then asks to see {{the history}} of the United States on the machine, and as it reaches the Great Depression of the 1930s, Beckwith dives into the {{projection}} and vanishes. The guardians inform Kirk that history has been altered, and upon returning to the , they discover that the vessel is now manned by renegades. They fight their way back to the transporter room and return to the planet, where the Guardians allow Kirk and Spock to pursue Beckwith into the past. They are informed by the Guardians that Beckwith prevented the death of Edith Koestler, and as in the final version, Kirk falls in love with her; in this version however, he does so knowing that she must die in the end. [...] Emotionally, he cannot stop Beckwith from attempting to save Koestler—Spock <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Roddenberry had asked for the ship specifically to be placed in danger, and so Ellison added the renegade element in response.|$|E

2500|$|On July 11, 2014, in a Reddit AMA, Del Toro said, [...] "Well, you know, we don't {{have that}} movie on the horizon, {{but the idea}} for {{it was to have}} Hellboy finally {{come to terms with the}} fact that his destiny, his {{inevitable}} destiny, is to become the beast of the Apocalypse, and having him and Liz face the sort of, that part of his nature, and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the 3rd film. He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous." ...|$|E
