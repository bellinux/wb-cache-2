5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art.

5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political <b>help</b> <b>to</b> Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would <b>help</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that <b>help</b> <b>to</b> feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not <b>help</b> <b>to</b> subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
