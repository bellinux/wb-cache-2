40|$|Insolvency law {{faces the}} {{challenge}} of properly liquidating insolvent estates. To achieve this, insolvency representatives need to be skilled, and paid. Countries have adopted differ- ent models for compensating insolvency representatives who liquidate estates. While a proper insolvency funding mechanism is important, the topic has received little scholarly attention, {{particularly with respect to}} the effects, benefits, and dangers of funding mechanisms in insolvency. This paper explores several mechanisms and distinguishes several models: <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate</b> funding, state funding, third party funding, not opening an in- solvency procedure at all. Using evidence from the U. K., Germany, and the Netherlands, this paper (1) demonstrates the dangers of <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate</b> funding, (2) explores whether state funding models, not opening an insolvency procedure or third party funding models can resolve the issues related to <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate</b> funding, and (3) discusses the limitations of the models. The results raise several questions as to {{what is the best way}} to liquidate estates...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive description and an analysis of a remediation solution in the insolvency proceedings, the reorganization under the Czech law and a comparison with French applicable law of restructuring. Act. No. 182 / 2006 Sb., hereinafter called as Insolvency Act, became effective on January, 1 st 2008. After economic crisis between the years 2007 and 2009 was proved the urgency to modify an unsuitable and outdated Czech law from 1991. Insolvency act brought many new institutes mainly to the Czech procedural law and finally it set up new methods for insolvency non-liquidation resolution - reorganization. Institute of reorganization utilizes varying restructuring methods principally intended for large businesses that fulfill the conditions of the reorganization proceedings. The thesis is divided into twelve chapters. First eight chapters are providing the reader with fundamental elements of insolvency proceedings that are necessary for the overview of the reorganization proceedings. These chapters are further divided into smaller parts covering the description of the historical development, explanation of bankruptcy, parties to the insolvency proceedings, insolvency petition, automatic stay and <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate.</b> The most important part of this thesis the ninth [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In Re: Defining Securitization, Professor Jonathan Lipson {{attempts}} {{to define a}} “true” securitization transaction, ultimately characterizing it as “a purchase of primary payment rights by a special purpose entity that (1) legally isolates such payment rights from a bankruptcy (or similar <b>insolvency)</b> <b>estate</b> of the originator, and (2) results, directly or indirectly, in the issuance of securities whose value {{is determined by the}} payment rights so purchased. ” There is much to admire in Lipson’s attempt but also much to question. Let me start with the admiration. Lipson’s article {{is by far the most}} systematic and thoughtful analysis of what securitization should mean. Importantly, he describes what he sees as the “essential elements of a securitization, its inputs (payment rights), structure (bankruptcy-proof legal isolation), and outputs (securities). ” Dividing securitization into inputs, structure, and outputs is rhetorically, if not also conceptually, sensible. Indeed, in teaching courses about securitization I often have referred to the left-hand side of the structure [...] which Lipson more felicitously calls the inputs [...] and the right-hand side of the structure [...] which Lipson (again more felicitously) calls the outputs. To the extent such terminology is intuitively descriptive, it advances understanding. In future courses, I intend to refer to inputs and outputs. I would, however, make one change to Lipson’s use of the term “structure” to describe the portion of a securitization transaction between the inputs and the outputs. Because “structure” intuitively means an entire structure [...] which, in the case of securitization, would also include the inputs and outputs [...] I suggest using the term “intermediate structure” instead. Thus, I will refer to a securitization transaction’s inputs, intermediate structure, and outputs. Even with that change, I still have several concerns with Professor Lipson’s definition of securitization. This Article will next discuss those concerns, showing that the definition is overly restrictive and potentially inaccurat...|$|E

This article {{examines}} whether C can insist {{the extinction of}} B"s claim, seized or belonging to <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate,</b> against garnishment creditor or trustee in bankruptcy, when ? A had claim against B, and B had claim against C, ? A, B, C made an arrangement(tripartite set-off contract) which stipulates that A"s claim and B"s claim are extinguished {{to the extent of}} the same amount, subject to contract terms, ? after such agreement, third party creditor(B"s creditor) seized B"s claim or B went into bankruptcy and ? after the seizure or commencement of insolvency procedure, contract terms were fulfilled. We can say this matter as the external effect of tripartite set-off contract. The main conclusions are as follows. If we can characterize tripartite set-off contract as ? assignment contract about A"s claim(which satisfies requirements for setting up assignment against the third party) or ? joint surety contract that C stands joint surety to A, C can insist the extinction of B"s claim. The ordinary tripartite contract about direct payment, which stipulates that A & B"s each claim is extinguished when C pays the same amount to A directly, can be classified as tripartite set-off contract in a broad sense. Because we can characterize tripartite contract about direct payment as joint surety & joint creditor contract that C stands joint surety to A, and B & A are joint creditors to C, C can also insist the extinction of B"s claim against the third party creditor. However, under the present security system about receivables, it is problematic to admit C"s refusal right of payment against garnishment creditor before the extinction of B"s claim, on the basis of tripartite contract about direct payment. It is more desirable to admit such refusal right, when A, B, C came to an agreement about pledge on the claim with requirements for setting up pledge against the third party. ? ??? 2014 ? ????? ????? ???? ?????(HY- 2014 -G) ...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{insolvency}} {{systems have}} been designed with larger enterprises in mind. They assume an extensive <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate</b> of significant worth, {{and the presence of}} creditors and other stakeholders with sufficient value at stake that they participate in and oversee the process. These assumptions undergird mechanisms by which creditors and other stakeholders may ensure that the insolvency process faithfully serves their interests, for an independent professional to run the business undergoing an insolvency process, and for extensive judicial oversight. These assumptions and features are incongruent with the reality of micro, small, and medium enterprises (2 ̆ 7 MSMEs 2 ̆ 7). Mirroring the general population of businesses and reflecting the particular fragility associated with smaller asset bases and relative absence of risk diversification, the vast majority of businesses entering insolvency proceedings are MSMEs. On MSME insolvency, little or no value is available for distribution to anyone other than secured creditors in a significant proportion of insolvency estates, and secured creditors tend to have effective collection methods under non-insolvency law. Correspondingly, most secured and unsecured creditors, as well as other stakeholders, are rationally disinterested in the insolvency process. In many cases, it is not worthwhile for either the estate or most stakeholders to engage lawyers to represent them in court. Estates may possess inadequate value even to pay an independent insolvency professional. Such incongruence between the design of insolvency regimes and the nature of most of the businesses to which they apply leaves the insolvency process unbalanced, inadequately supervised, non-efficacious, and sometimes, simply unfeasible. Policy-makers and legislators have often responded through ad hoc changes to the ‘standard’ regime, such as by shearing some elements of the insolvency process when applied to smaller businesses, by shortening statutory timelines, and by dispensing with the necessary participation of certain stakeholders. The resulting processes have been marked by arbitrary boundaries, rigid preconditions for availability, and limited effectiveness. This paper systematically rethinks the treatment of distressed MSMEs. At its core is a new ‘Modular Approach’ to MSME insolvency. This approach is modular in two ways: (i) it allows national policy makers to choose from a range of available options including in terms of the involvement of appropriate institutions; (ii) subject to national authorities’ design decisions, the Modular Approach provides an essential ‘core’ process in each case, and allows relevant stakeholders to invoke additional tools (‘modules’) if and when the benefits of wielding those tools in the particular case outweigh the costs. The Modular Approach shares with ‘standard’ insolvency regimes the core objectives of preserving and maximizing the value in the <b>insolvency</b> <b>estate,</b> ensuring distribution over an appropriate period of time of the highest feasible proportion of that value to those entitled to it, providing due accountability for any wrongdoing connected with the insolvency, and enabling discharge of over-indebted natural persons. The Modular Approach differs in the way it pursues these objectives. Its basic assumption is that the parties to a particular insolvency case are best placed to select the tools appropriate to that case. The role of the legal regime should be to provide these tools in a maximally flexible way, while creating the correct incentives for their deployment. Traditionally, legal systems provide particular ‘packages’ or combinations of these tools and label them ‘workout’, ‘liquidation’ and ‘restructuring’. The Modular Approach unpacks those combinations. It assumes a core process, geared towards enabling the entrepreneur to propose a restructuring of the business’ liabilities and to obtain discharge of any unrepayable obligations. The entrepreneur, who may operate through a legal entity or as a sole trader, may access any of the full range of insolvency law mechanisms to enable attainment of these objectives. At the same time, creditors and other stakeholders have the right to adequate notification of each step in the process, coupled with the power to override the entrepreneur’s choices where a sufficient proportion of them consider it appropriate to do so. Judicial involvement is not required as a matter of course, though, again, it may be requested by the stipulated proportion of creditors. The process may obtain and retain momentum by virtue of the presumptions that stakeholders who have not positively objected to a step in the process have consented to that step, and that the non-exercise of procedural rights within the process precludes the relevant stakeholders from objecting to the part of the process to which the unexercised rights relate. Stakeholders are divided into appropriate classes; they must act by stipulated majority by value; and stipulated majorities by value of a class may bind dissenting minorities. The Modular Approach is designed to provide appropriate incentives for the entrepreneur and other stakeholders alike. Entrepreneurs have positive incentives to commence the insolvency process in a timely manner: {{they do not have to}} declare the business insolvent; they may, in principle, retain its management; and they have the right to propose how the insolvency should proceed. Entrepreneurs also face negative incentives that discourage non-timely commencement of insolvency proceedings, in that the Modular Approach imposes personal liability for any additional loss suffered by the business’ creditors because of blameworthy delay in commencement. The Modular Approach acknowledges that in many MSME insolvencies, unsecured creditors are rationally disinterested, given their limited economic stake and the very limited likelihood of any recovery in the process. They need not actively participate in the process if, upon due notification, they do not consider it worth the time and expense of participating. As noted, their abstention is deemed approval, and the insolvency process may continue apace. Negative incentives for creditors arise because the non-exercise of procedural rights amounts to a waiver of such rights. Positive incentives arise in creditors’ ability, acting with others who together hold a sufficiently large proportion of the claims against the enterprise, to override the entrepreneur’s choice of tools and to select a destiny for the business different to the one favoured by the entrepreneur. The Modular Approach also responds to differences in the economic, social and legal circumstances of different countries. It does so by guiding national policymakers with respect to the factors relevant to determining the proper boundaries between ‘standard’ and MSME insolvency regimes, and by identifying three functions: management, administrative and judicial. The Approach explains the costs and benefits of assigning those functions to different entities...|$|E
