5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's <b>just</b> <b>always</b> been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

He later recalled: [...] "My grandfather decided when I was about four [...] I {{was going to be}} a barrister, so I <b>just</b> <b>always</b> assumed I was. It turned out to be a wise decision." [...] Goldstone was educated at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and subsequently undertook a six-year legal studies course at the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he graduated in 1962 with a BA LLB cum laude.|$|E

Robbins {{is described as}} [...] "quirky [...] perky" [...] by TV Guide Matt Mitovich, and [...] "a clear and rational surgeon who is not ruled by her emotions" [...] by Kris De Leon of BuddyTV. William Harper, writer of the episode [...] "Beat Your Heart Out" [...] in which Robbins and Torres kiss for the first time, has deemed Robbins: [...] "genuinely, positively interested in people, in the most selfless way." [...] Commenting on Robbins' confidence, Capshaw commented: [...] "she never thinks she's wrong and you don't hate her for it. There's no ego though, she <b>just</b> <b>always</b> thinks she's right and she is." [...] She is portrayed as having [...] "wacky tendencies", including wearing roller shoes to work.|$|E

Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've <b>just</b> <b>always</b> been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E

The clip was filmed {{in a house in}} Maplewood, New Jersey, where a crowd gathered the watch the trio on set. Following that, filming was cordoned by local police. Several pictures of Beyoncé arriving on set were shared on social networks by fans. Williams debuted the clip for [...] "Say Yes" [...] on her appearance at Good Morning America on June 18, 2014. Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home. Bring it back together because when we were together, we go back to how we were when we were younger, <b>just</b> <b>always</b> laughing and talking about things. It's been a great moment." [...] The video was released on Williams' Vevo account the same day. A behind-the-scenes footage was also released featuring the trio on set and talking about the song and their reunion. In the clip, Williams said she felt excited that she had her [...] "sisters" [...] with her spreading a positive message for the world.|$|E
500|$|Director Csupó {{stated that}} they had no actors {{initially}} in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó [...] "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" [...] that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's <b>just</b> <b>always</b> lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{characters}} are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed; {{in addition to}} the larger themes of corruption and conspiracy. By grounding [...] "everyday neurosis – our everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves" [...] in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience. The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous. In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through these clashings of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth. The director also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, [...] "From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to <b>just</b> <b>always</b> be driven by the things that were important to me." [...] Writing for The Playlist, Oliver Lyttelton singled out parenthood as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding; [...] "the director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from Batman Begins onwards (previous films, it should be said, pre-dated the birth of his kids)." ...|$|E
500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just the most horrible thing ever put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've <b>just</b> <b>always</b> hated that song. I hate any song from that era, really. It's just a horrible time for music." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He <b>just</b> <b>always</b> adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

[...] From an early age, she has also had a special love for pretty-sounding pop music. [...] In a 1998 interview, she stated, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>always</b> liked pop music and really good melodies and major chords. That's just the type of music that comes naturally to me".

2500|$|After {{moving to}} San Diego {{in the summer}} of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he {{expressed}} his desire to be in a band. Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer. In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge's garage. To impress DeLonge, Hoppus {{climbed to the top of}} a streetlight outside of DeLonge's home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being in crutches for the next few weeks. DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: [...] "When I first met Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were <b>just</b> <b>always</b> having fun."

2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I <b>just</b> <b>always</b> felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E
