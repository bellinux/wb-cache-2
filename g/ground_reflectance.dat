40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{calibrate}} satellite data obtained at large polar (i. e., off-nadir) view angles for effects caused by scanner geometry and by the atmosphere. If such effects are not corrected for, then recorded radiance data will contain systematic and random errors which will make accurate target identification and quantification difficult. Adequate calibration of digital radiance data requires both an inductive analysis of digital satellite images and a deductive analysis based upon a priori simulation studies. The inputs to a simulation model (<b>ground</b> <b>reflectance,</b> atmospheric transmission and bandscatter) and their variability are dependent upon (for example) sun-target-sensor geometry.

A DRM, in our concept, is a function that for each ground point returns a reflectance value and a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). In a similar way to the terrain geometric reconstruction procedure, given an image block of some terrain area, we split the DRM generation in two phases: radiometric block adjustment and DRM generation. In the paper we concentrate on the radiometric block adjustment step, but we also describe a preliminary DRM generator. In the block adjustment step, after a radiometric pre-calibraton step, local atmosphere radiative transfer parameters, and <b>ground</b> <b>reflectances</b> and BRDFs at the radiometric tie points are estimated. This radiometric block adjustment is based on atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) models, pre-selected BRDF models and radiometric ground control points.

40|$|Active {{remote sensing}} using lidar {{appears to be}} very {{attractive}} for the measurement of atmospheric greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from spaceborne platforms. Feasibility studies are currently being performed to demonstrate the required measurement performance. Due to the high precision required (less than 0. 3 %) for climate studies, space-borne IPDA (Integrating Path Differential Absorption) Lidar is preferred over the range resolving DIAL technique which uses atmospheric backscatter. This {{is due to the}} larger Lidar echoes from hard target when using systems of comparable size. Applying the IPDA Lidar method, magnitude and variability of the <b>ground</b> <b>reflectance</b> becomes an important issue in terms of instrument sizing and pointing requirements of space-borne systems. Because of the stringent sensitivity requirements, even small gradients of the <b>ground</b> <b>reflectance</b> could introduce noticeable retrieval errors in the CO 2 column content, when the laser transmitter does not point on the same ground spot for the on- and off-line measurement. However, the current knowledge on the variability of the <b>ground</b> <b>reflectance</b> both in the appropriate wavelength range and on small spatial scales is insufficient for an accurate error assessment. In order to address these deficiencies, airborne lidar measurements at 1. 6 µm wavelength were performed. The wavelength range around 1. 6 µm provides suitable absorption lines for the measurement of carbon dioxide. A pulsed optical parametric oscillator (OPO) system (5 mJ at 1573 nm, 10 Hz pulse rate) was deployed on the DLR Cessna Caravan aircraft to measure the variations of the ground return.
