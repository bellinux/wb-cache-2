In this paper we discuss how credit scoring techniques and modern credit risk portfolio models can be used to measure credit risk and check Basel II calibration for such an environment. After reviewing the development of credit risk portfolio models, to explain our choice in using CreditRisk+, we discuss the definition and estimation methodology for a set of essential parameter inputs, which in turn depend on the data available - in this case from the Argentine public credit bureau. We then simulate, bank by bank, the introduction of Basel II's <b>foundation</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> using the same data for Argentina and compare the results. We analyze how the IRB approach might be recalibrated and finally discuss a set of other issues regarding IRB implementation in an emerging economy. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{very much}} enjoyed reading this paper. The basic message that I took away was that {{by and large}} {{different}} banks rate a given borrower in {{pretty much the same}} way. While we do see differences, on the whole at least to my eye these differences are generally small. I therefore read the paper as basically good news for the New Basel Capital Accord. If we want to worry about any of the results in this paper we might be concerned that when differences exist they tend to be for the poorer quality credits where a difference of one ratings grade has a bigger effect on capital. But all in all there is not as much to worry about here as I thought there might have been. I have no substantive criticisms of the paper. The dataset is innovative. Mark is well aware of its limitations and these are discussed nicely in the paper. And the interpretation of the results is more than reasonable. Therefore, in my comments, what I would like to do is to focus on two issues that mean that while Mark’s paper should give us considerable comfort, we should not yet sleep perfectly at night! The first issue is the existence of evidence that could be seen as conflicting. And the second is the question of how ratings systems can be verified by supervisory authorities. Conflicting evidence I would like to show two pieces of evidence that could be seen as conflicting. The first is from Jordan, Peek and Rosengren (2002). These authors track the ratings of a portfolio of syndicated loans in the US and then calculate what the capital requirement would have been under the proposed <b>Foundation</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> (using the January 2001 proposals). They do this is two ways. The first assumes that a bank holding this portfolio of loans uses external credit ratings (from Standard and Poor’s) as the basis for its internal ratings. The second assumes that the bank assigns loans to ratings classes based on KMV EDFs. The results are shown in Figure 1. ...|$|E
40|$|The new Basel II Capital Accord {{has demanded}} {{a lot of}} {{attention}} from regulatory and regulated entities due to its innovations in determining capital requirements, particularly in the area of credit risk. This paper simulates the application of Basel II <b>IRB</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>approach</b> for the computation of capital and provision requirements relative to the credit risk of major Brazilian banks' corporate credit portfolios. The IRB necessary parameters of probabilities of default are estimated using variables derived from the raw data present in the Public Credit Register of the Central Bank of Brazil.

By making use of the CreditRisk+ portfolio model this paper shows how it is possible to extend the previous comparison.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{quantification}} of potential impacts of credit risk management approaches on the financial performance using collaterals as techniques to reduce credit risk of commercial bank. The requirement to coordinate regulation of the capital adequacy has resulted from fears of central banks of the most developed countries that the capital held by banks to cover even a small loss is not sufficient. Due to the interconnection of financial markets, {{there is a possibility}} that transfer problems of individual banks and problems caused by external shocks could threaten the entire system. The article is focused on quantitative analyses of selected methods of credit risk management using collaterals in the intention of Basel II and quantification of their impact on determining the amount of equity that bank must hold. To set the optimal amount of equity related with the risk portfolio is the one of the most important precondition to increase efficiency and competitiveness of commercial banks. To explain better the usage of internal rating models and techniques reducing credit risk, the amount of capital requirements for the simulated portfolio are calculated and the obtained results within a standardized and <b>foundation</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>approaches</b> are compared. The achievement of higher capital requirements of Basel II doesn't automatically mean that a bank would be safe and also profitable. The equity growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving greater security of the banking sector. In the article, methods of analysis, synthesis, and analysis of causes, induction and deduction are used. In the empirical analysis two methods of Basel II have been used and the results of calculating capital requirements have been calculated. Finally, the methods of comparison have been applied and the question which method provides the highest demand for capital has been raised and compared with other methods. A simple and a comprehensive approach of Standardized Approach and foundation approaches of Internal Rating Based Approach with and without collateral instruments have been put into this comparison. The equation of approaches to credit risk management confirmed the specified hypothesis that quality internal rating system strongly supports the bank's financial performance. The calculations of the working team show that the use of internal rating models brings a significant increase in earnings and profitability through a significant saving in equity in banking practice. The current results demonstrate that the requirement of capital could decrease by approximately 30 %, which means using of an internal rating model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of the assets, the amount of the interest margins and the profitability ratio. Even saving capital through "the improved credit risk management", which was considered one of the important stabilizing elements in this system, does not work in banking practice and therefore the system of internal ratings should be adjusted to the new regulatory conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Basel II {{internal}} ratings-based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approach</b> {{to capital}} adequacy for credit risk {{plays an important}} role in protecting the Australian banking sector against insolvency. We outline the mathematical foundations of regulatory capital modelling for credit risk, and extend the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> to a more general setting than the usual Gaussian case. It rests on the proposition that quantiles of the distribution of conditional expectation of portfolio percentage loss may be substituted for quantiles of the portfolio loss distribution. We present a more compact proof of this proposition under weaker assumptions. The <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> implements the so-called asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model, an asset value factor model of credit risk. The robustness of the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> to a relaxation in model assumptions is evaluated on a portfolio that is representative of the credit exposures of the Australian banking sector. We measure the rate of convergence, in terms of number of obligors, of empirical loss distributions to the asymptotic (infinitely fine-grained) portfolio loss distribution; and we evaluate the sensitivity of credit risk capital to dependence structure as modelled by asset correlations and elliptical copulas. A separate time series analysis takes measurements from the ASRF model of the prevailing state of Australia's economy and the level of capitalisation of its banking sector. These readings find general agreement with macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and external credit ratings. However, given the range of economic conditions, from mild contraction to moderate expansion, experienced in Australia since the implementation of Basel II, we cannot attest to the validity of the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> for its intended purpose of solvency assessment.

This approach allows us to (i) make individual forecasts of default risk conditional on company, loan and macro variables, (ii) study portfolio credit risk over time, (iii) assess to what extent the new Accord will achieve its main objective of increasing credit risk sensitivity in minimal capital charges, and (iv) compare current capital requirements to those under the proposed system.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to render}} a {{fundamental}} {{assessment of the}} Basel II internal ratings-based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approach</b> by taking readings of the Australian banking sector since the implementation of Basel II and comparing them with signals from macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and external credit ratings. The <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> to capital adequacy for credit risk, which implements an asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model, {{plays an important role}} in protecting the Australian banking sector against insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: Realisations of the single systematic risk factor, interpreted as describing the prevailing state of the Australian economy, are recovered from the ASRF model and compared with macroeconomic indicators. Similarly, estimates of distance-to-default, reflecting the capacity of the Australian banking sector to absorb credit losses, are recovered from the ASRF model and compared with financial statistics and external credit ratings. With the implementation of Basel II preceding the time when the effect of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 was most acutely felt, the authors measure the impact of the crisis on the Australian banking sector. Findings: Measurements from the ASRF model find general agreement with signals from macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and external credit ratings. This leads to a favourable assessment of the ASRF model for the purposes of capital allocation, performance attribution and risk monitoring. The empirical analysis used in this paper reveals that the recent crisis imparted a mild stress on the Australian banking sector. Research limitations/implications: Given the range of economic conditions, from mild contraction to moderate expansion, experienced in Australia since the implementation of Basel II, the authors cannot attest to the validity of the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> for its intended purpose of solvency assessment.
