In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake and was {{astonished}} {{to see that the}} Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E

Then they drew the Servant by the <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dance, and the youth began a joyous song about the infant Jesus...|$|E

25|$|It is {{traditionally}} shaped by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled {{for a short time}} in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.|$|E
25|$|After 1891, {{the canal}} principally transported coal, and {{sometimes}} West Virginia limestone, wood, lumber, sand, and flour. (Statistics were only kept for coal.) Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, {{which consisted of}} dumping four carloads of coal into the boat. Some of the coal had to be shoveled by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody {{would be on the}} boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the ridge poles would be put, then the hatches over the ridge poles and openings. The crew would scrub down the boat (using water from the canal) to remove the dust, and the boat would be poled {{to the other side of}} the basin, where it would be hitched to the mules.|$|E

When Presto lunges at Alec through the hat, Alec directs Presto's <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> podium's drawer and closes the drawer, painfully restraining the hand while he looks through Presto's sleeve for the carrot. Presto runs towards Alec, but instead is poked in both eyes by his own hand. Presto drops his hat, and when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally strips his slacks down to underwear, to Alec's amusement.|$|E

Kennedy, whose {{government}} {{was the main}} sponsor of Diệm's regime, learned of Đức's death when handed the morning newspapers while {{he was talking to}} his brother, Attorney General Robert F.

[...] He later remarked that [...] "no news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one."

She lives on the outskirts of society and makes her home near [...] "graveyards, gibbets, and the battlefields copiously supplied by civil war"; she uses the body parts from these locations in her magic spells. Indeed, she delights in otherwise heinous and macabre acts involving corpses (for instance, [...] "when the dead are confined in a sarcophagus [...] then she eagerly rages every limb. She plunges her <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eyes, delights at digging out the congealed eyeballs, and gnaws the pallid nails on a desiccated hand.").|$|E

[...] Miantinomo's successor, Pessicus, declared war against Uncas and the colonies fined him 2000 fathoms of wampum for causing the hostilities, which he was unable to pay." [...] "Humphrey Atherton was sent by the commissioners of the Four Colonies, with twenty armed men, to enforce the payment. As stated in Arnold's history of Rhode Island (vol. i., p. 199), 'Atherton forced his way, pistol in <b>hand,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wigwam, and, seizing the Sachem by the hair, dragged him out, threatening instant death if any resistance was offered.'

500|$|Saint-Just {{immediately}} {{exhibited the}} ruthless disciplinarianism {{for which he}} would be famous. Within a few months he was the commanding officer, at the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At local meetings he moved attendees with his patriotic zeal and flair: in one much-repeated story, Saint-Just brought the town council to tears by thrusting his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flame of a burning anti-revolutionary pamphlet, swearing his devotion to the Republic. He had powerful allies when he sought {{to become a member}} of [...] his district’s electoral assembly, and he initiated correspondence with well-known leaders of the Revolution like Camille Desmoulins. In late 1790, he wrote to Robespierre for the first time, asking him to consider a local petition. The letter was filled with the highest of praise, beginning: “You, who uphold our tottering country against the torrent of despotism and intrigue; you whom I know, as I know God, only through his miracles...” Through their correspondence, the two developed [...] "a deep and mysterious friendship that would last until the day [...] died." ...|$|E
500|$|Cranmer {{was told}} that {{he would be able to}} make a final recantation but this time in public during a service at the University Church. He wrote and {{submitted}} the speech in advance and it was published after his death. At the pulpit on the day of his execution, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the king and queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script. He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and as such he stated his hand would be punished by being burnt first. He then said, [...] "And as for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy, and Antichrist with all his false doctrine." [...] He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been burnt six months before. As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart of the fire while saying [...] "that unworthy hand" [...] and his dying words were, [...] "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit...I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jaan Puhvel notes {{similarities}} between the Norse myth in which the god Týr inserts his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wolf Fenrir's mouth while the other gods bind him with Gleipnir, only for Fenrir to bite off Týr's hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings, and the Iranian myth in which Jamshid rescues his brother's corpse from Ahriman's bowels by shoving his hand up Ahriman's anus and pulling out his brother's corpse, only for his hand to become infected with leprosy. In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> being's orifice (in Fenrir's case the mouth, in Ahriman's the anus) and losing it. Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and {{are unlikely to be}} remnants of a Proto-Indo-European [...] "evil god"; nonetheless, {{it is clear that the}} [...] "binding myth" [...] is of Proto-Indo-European origin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fields are}} tilled {{when the first}} rains arrive – {{traditionally}} measured at 40 days after Thingyan, the Burmese New Year – around the beginning of June. In modern times, tractors are used, but traditionally, buffalos were employed. The rice plants are planted in nurseries and then transplanted by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prepared fields. The rice is then harvested in late November – [...] "when the rice bends with age". Most of the rice planting and harvesting are done by hand.

2500|$|William Pigott Cronan (March 6, 1879 [...] March 18, 1929) was a United States Navy Captain {{who served}} as the 19th Naval Governor of Guam. During his tenure in the Navy, he became decorated, {{commanded}} a number of ships, and {{came to be known as}} [...] "the most popular man in the Navy". He participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War. In 1903, he gained some attention for his participation in the rescue of a Venezuelan fisherman off the coast of La Guaira under bad conditions. Both the Venezuelan government and navy command praised him for the way he carried out the operation. He became a national news story in 1907 while serving aboard the USS Connecticut during a training operation.

2500|$|As Rundle and {{the others}} ran across the open {{ground in front of}} the fort, Confederate cannons opened fire and inflicted heavy casualties. The group was sent into disarray and efforts to {{continue}} the mission were abandoned. Rundle and {{the other members of the}} advance party sought cover in the trench at the base of the fort walls. The Confederates, unable to lower the aim of their cannons enough to fire into the Union soldiers, began lighting cannonballs and tossing them by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trench. The fuses proved to be too long, however, and the Union soldiers were able to jump out of harm's way before they exploded. Some of the men, including Rundle, began picking up the lit cannonballs and throwing them back at the Confederates. The soldiers remained trapped until nightfall, when Rundle and others were able to escape back to the Union lines; only 30 of the original 150 men made it back. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on July 26, 1894. His official citation reads ...|$|E
2500|$|The unusual {{sharpness}} of the inscription letters has long led epigraphists {{to believe that}} they were not carved by <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clay. The typographic character of the inscription was recently demonstrated in a systematic examination of the text body by the typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle. His findings confirm that the text was produced with a printing method {{similar to that of the}} Phaistos Disc: The 17-line text was created by pressing individual, pre-formed stamps (probably made of wood) into the soft clay in a way that, for each letter which occurred more than once, the same letter stamp was re-used, thereby producing identical imprints throughout the text. Thus, the essential criterion for typographic text production was met, namely the repeated use of identical types for a single character. In applying this technique, it is not relevant that the Prüfening inscription was made by stamping letters into the clay and not − as later practiced by Gutenberg − by printing on paper, since neither the technical execution nor the print medium define movable type printing, but rather the criterion of type identity: ...|$|E
