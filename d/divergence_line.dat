30|$|Using the {{measurements}} {{associated with each}} candidate location, ML estimation is then performed in order to localise each potential target. The ML estimation problem cannot be solved analytically, and an iterative G-N approach (e.g. [24]) is used to solve an equivalent non-linear least squares problem. The G-N approach performs iterative gradient descent, {{and in order to}} combat potential <b>divergence,</b> <b>line</b> search and randomisation are used to ensure that each iteration increases the value of the likelihood. It is noted that alternative techniques, such as the Newton-Raphson (N-R) approach (e.g. [25]) or the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [26, 27], could also be used to perform the gradient descent and may offer similar performance.|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of cold air outbreaks, the {{combination}} of the coastal shape and the sea surface temperature (SST) pattern have a profound effect in establishing a low level mesoscale atmospheric circulation as a result of differential heating due to both variations in overwater path length and the SST. A convergence (or <b>divergence)</b> <b>line</b> then forms along a line exactly downwind of the major bend in the coastline. All {{this is consistent with the}} structure of the cloud patterns seen in a high resolution Landsat picture of the cloud streets and the major features are simulated well with a boundary layer model. The dominant convergence line is marked by notably larger clouds. To its east the convective roll clouds grow downstream in accord with the deepening of the boundary layer. To its west (i. e., coastal side) where the induced pressure field forces a strong westerly component in the boundary layer, the wind shear across the inversion gives rise to Kelvin-Helmholtz waves and billow clouds whose orientation is perpendicular to the shear vector and to the major convergence line. The induced mesoscale circulation will feedback on the ocean by intensifying the wind generated ocean wave growth and altering their orientation. Coastal cyclogenesis is due in large part not only to the fluxes of heat and moisture from the ocean, but particularly to the differential heating and moistening of the boundary layer air when the air trajectories pass over a well defined pattern of SST...|$|E
40|$|By {{using the}} {{numerical}} forecasting product, the convention, the {{automatic weather station}} and Doppler weather radar materials, it analyzed Hunan strong convective weather process on April 4, 2006. The result indicated: The preliminary weather returns to warmer continually, and accumulate massive unstable energies, the vertical wind shear, the power, the thermal energy and the water vapor condition are advantageous to the strong convection weather production; During this process, ground and the upper air temperature, the humidity, the kinetic energy perturbation quantity, the ground temperature perturbation is bigger than each level upper air of the temperature perturbation obviously, it explained that the ground thermal energy function is bigger {{than that of the}} high level; In the disturbance moisture field, transfers the weather to have the region each level humidity is smaller than the environment humidity perturbation, this possibly presents one of thunderstorm gale reasons, each level's humidity perturbation is quite big, therefore transfers is very exuberant; In the perturbation kinetic energy field, the region which the process happens of perturbation energy is bigger than that of before and after process obviously. In each level, 850 hPa perturbation energy is the biggest, the ground comes second; The ground mesoscale spoke vanishing line and the strong convection's formation has the very good corresponding relationship. The intensity chart has the massive strong convection echo, the strong center is bigger than 55 dBz, the echo top elevation is bigger than 12 km, the Gust-Fronts characteristic is very obvious; On the speed chart, the mesoscale <b>divergence</b> <b>line</b> appear earlier than convection echo band approximately a half hour, what with strong echo band to correspond are the cyclone, against front echo characteristics and so on...|$|E
