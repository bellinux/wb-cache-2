5000|$|In {{the days}} before {{automatic}} transmissions were common, especially in the 1950s, many rear-wheel drive American cars were available with an overdrive option. Borg Warner provided the box that was factory-installed between the transmission and a foreshortened driveshaft. Since the overdrive function, if enabled, could be shifted by simply easing up on the accelerator without depressing the clutch pedal, the action was much like a semi-automatic. Also, an electrically operated solenoid would deactivate the unit via a switch under the accelerator pedal providing {{the equivalent of the}} <b>kickdown</b> of the automatic. A knob connected to a bowden cable, similar to some emergency brake applications, was also provided to lock out the unit mechanically.

5000|$|Some {{transmissions}} have a mode {{in which}} the driver has full control of ratios change (either by moving the selector, or {{through the use of}} buttons or paddles), completely overriding the automated function of the hydraulic controller. Such control is particularly useful in cornering, to avoid unwanted upshifts or downshifts that could compromise the vehicle's balance or traction. [...] "Manumatic" [...] shifters, first popularized by Porsche in the 1990s under the trade name Tiptronic, have become a popular option on sports cars and other performance vehicles. With the near-universal prevalence of electronically controlled transmissions, they are comparatively simple and inexpensive, requiring only software changes, and the provision of the actual manual controls for the driver. The amount of true manual control provided is highly variable: some systems will override the driver's selections under certain conditions, generally in the interest of preventing engine damage. Since these gearboxes also have a throttle <b>kickdown</b> switch, it is impossible to fully exploit the engine power at low to medium engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|The HG {{series of}} July 1970 {{was a minor}} {{refinement}} of the existing formula, adopted as the marketing platform for the new three-speed automatic transmission option called Tri-Matic. The first of these locally made transmissions actually {{found their way into}} the last of the HT series cars. These transmissions were later criticised for unreliability and became colloquially known by dispondants, as the Traumatic. Only the HG Monaro GTS350 retained the Powerglide transmission if an automatic preference was optioned.HG commercial variants continued to be built and sold alongside the HQ series passenger vehicles until very late in 1971 when the HQ commercials were released.

50|$|The range {{selector}} (looked like {{a column}} shift) had three positions: Low, High, and Reverse. Low consisted {{of what would}} be first and second gear with an ordinary four-speed; High was third and fourth. Reverse was single ratio. Driving one was/is quite different: Upon starting, one would disengage the clutch, then choose a ratio (High for normal driving), and, whilst stopped with foot on the brake, engage the clutch. Pressing the accelerator would move you forward, in third, with the fluid coupling connecting the engine to the transmission. Upon reaching 15 - 20 mph, the accelerator is lifted, a 'clunk' would ensue (the automatic shift), and you would continue in fourth gear. Low range was quite similar, but much slower speeds. It is possible to start in Low, allow the shift, then move the range selector to High, using the clutch, and continue in High. This allowed somewhat faster acceleration, but was quite clumsy. <b>Kickdown</b> for passing was possible through electrical connections made by flooring the accelerator, though only in one range (i.e.: fourth to third).|$|E

50|$|When {{starting}} out in Drive range, low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide smooth engagement without slip. As the vehicle accelerated, rear pump output would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' <b>kickdown</b> for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and double wrap low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in Drive range to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission. Corvair Powerglides had a good reputation for reliability and were ordered on {{a large majority of}} Corvair passenger cars.|$|E
50|$|The 4HP22 {{transmission}} can be rendered undriveable when held on P or N setting and too high engine rotation speed is applied for too long, for instance during emissions testing. Examples of situations {{that could lead}} to transmission failure include warming up the catalytic converter on petrol engine-powered vehicle with too high RPM, or while measuring amount of smoke on diesel engine-powered vehicle and keeping the throttle full for too long time.The correct procedure would be to stop the engine for at least 90 seconds, do the test (without selecting again D or R, this means without re-pressurizing the gearbox) for no longer than a minute, and if the procedure must be repeated, stop again for at least 90 seconds and repeat.Another issue is the governor valve sticking, which can be caused by contamination. i.e. clutch plates or other parts disintegrating. The fine debris finds its way past the filter and tends to accumulate in the governor, causing it to stick. A temporary solution is to remove and clean the governor. The problem will often recur as debris from damaged parts continues to build up in the governor. If the problem continues after cleaning the governor then it may be necessary it replace the autobox.Usual symptoms are failing to shift after 1st gear while the gearbox is still cold, and then failing to <b>kickdown</b> to 1st while at a stop. The governor is located {{at the end of the}} gearbox and usually it starts to work again after a cleanup.|$|E

Using the gear selector, the driver can either select {{position}} D for automated gear selection or can switch to SPORT mode. SPORT mode offers manual gear selection {{and at the}} same time switches to very sporty drive and suspension settings. In SPORT mode, the engine and electric motor deliver extra performance, accelerator response is faster and the power boost from the electric motor is maximized. And to keep the battery topped up, SPORT mode also activates maximum energy recuperation during overrun and braking as the electric motorâs generator function, which recharges the battery using kinetic energy, switches to a more powerful setting. The Driving Experience Control switch on the center console offers a choice of two settings. On starting, COMFORT mode is activated, which offers a balance between sporty performance and fuel efficiency, with unrestricted access to all convenience functions. Alternatively, the ECO PRO mode can be engaged, which, on the BMW i8 as on other models, supports an efficiency-optimized driving style. On this mode the powertrain controller coordinates the cooperation between the gasoline engine and the electric motor for maximum fuel economy. On deceleration, the intelligent energy management system automatically decides, in line with the driving situation and vehicle status, whether to recuperate braking energy or to coast with the powertrain disengaged. At the same time, ECO PRO mode also programs electrical convenience functions such as the air conditioning, seat heating and heated mirrors to operate at minimum power consumption, but without compromising safety. The maximum driving range of the BMW i8 on a full fuel tank and with a fully charged battery is more than 500 km in COMFORT mode, which can be increased by up to 20% in ECO PRO mode. The BMW i8âs ECO PRO mode can also be used during all-electric operation. The vehicle is then powered solely by the electric motor. Only if the battery charge drops below a given level, or under sudden intense throttle application such as <b>kickdown,</b> is the internal combustion engine automatically activated.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kiaâs research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kiaâs existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under <b>kickdown</b> or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmissionâs boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Ceeâd GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCTâs seven gears allow the GT Lineâs diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engineâs torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engineâs improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCTâs development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Ceeâd GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT drivetrain was augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and steel flywheel in the so-called Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain [1]. This transmission concept managed to combine two contradictive goals: Â· the driveability {{in terms of the}} pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved; Â· and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. These goals were achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, enabled by the large ratiocoverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 'peakshaver' during engine speed transients: it delivers power during (semi-) pedal <b>kickdown</b> and absorbs the engine's kinetic energy at pedal back-out. The current paper presents an improved concept with respect to the Zero Inertia drivetrain, which enables a reduced flywheel size while enhancing the pedal-towheel response even further. This concept is designated the Impulse Shift CVT (IS-CVT). The IS-CVT incorporates a slightly modified drive clutch and uses it to interrupt the power flow through the CVT during <b>kickdown</b> accelerations. Disengaging the drive clutch directs the entire engine power flow through the parallel (flywheel and planetary gear) branch, resulting in an immediate flywheel assist while the engine speeds up rapidly. When the engine has reached its desired speed, the drive clutch is re-engaged and the power flow through the CVT is reinstated. The presented IS-CVT concept enables much faster speed transients, independent of the CVT shift rate, resulting in a more effective use of the flywheel energy. Hence the flywheel can be reduced, and the ZI effect can be exploited to the fullest. Furthermore, the demands on the variator actuators can be lower. Simulations of the performance of the IS-CVT are presented and compared to those of CVT and ZI equipped vehicles...|$|E
40|$|IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2015 (IV 2015), Seoul, COREE, REPUBLIQUE DE, 28 -/ 06 / 2015 - 01 / 07 / 2015 In this study, {{results of}} an {{ecodriving}} challenge that {{took place during the}} Paris Motor Show in 2014 are presented. The principle of this challenge was to drive a passenger car as far as possible with a limited quantity of energy (15 cL). The experimental setup, constituted of a the SiVIC software, an Oculus Rift Helmet and a fuel consumption model, is also detailed. 1211 trips of visitors were validated during the 17 days of the event. Results showed that high acceleration without <b>kickdown</b> is desirable and that constant speed can lead to significant reduction in energy consumption. Next work will concentrate on improving the simulation and the scenario to increase the immersion realism and the ecodriving behavior sensitivity...|$|E
