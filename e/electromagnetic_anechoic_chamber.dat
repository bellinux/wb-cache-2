40|$|Wireless {{communication}} is inherently vulnerable {{in nature and}} packets can be corrupted due to various reasons. The network performance can potentially be improved if one is {{able to identify the}} reasons for packet corruption and react to them accordingly. However, none of the current wireless protocols do so. In this paper, we design a novel scheme to diagnose packet corruption in OFDM wireless networks by statistically analyzing certain available physical layer information, based on the observation that different causes of corruption result in different per-symbol-SINR patterns within a packet. Our approach introduces no additional traffic overhead. By running experiments on a GNU radio test bed in an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> we study and demonstrate that one can separate three reasons for packet corruption: weak signal, interference from transmitters using the same band, and interference from transmitters using an adjacent band.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{reflection}} {{characteristics of a}} composite Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) surface consisting of multiple orthogonal gradient AMC surfaces arranged in a two-dimensional periodic pattern. The gradient AMC surface in this study consists of square metal patches of variable size printed on a grounded dielectric substrate. Due to the orthogonal placement of the gradient AMC surface, the incident energy of a plane wave normally incident on the composite AMC surface will be reflected into four major lobes away from the impinging direction. To achieve a systematical design, a simple formula based on array antenna theory was developed to determine the reflection pattern of the gradient AMC surface illuminated by a normal incident plane wave. A time-domain full-wave simulation was also carried out to calculate the electromagnetic fields in the structure and the far-field patterns. The scattering patterns of the structure were measured in an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> Results confirm the design principle and procedures in this research. Since such a composite AMC surface can be easily fabricated using the standard printed circuit board technique without via-hole process, it may have potential applications in beam-steering and radar cross section reduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, we {{analyzed}} the frequency {{spectrum of the}} electromagnetic waves radiated by an electric discharge as a basic study to develop an on-line diagnostic technique for power equipment installed inside closed-switchboards. In order to simulate local and series arc discharges caused by an electric field concentration and poor connections, three types of electrode systems were fabricated, consisting of needle and plane electrodes and an arc generator meeting the specifications of UL 1699. The experiment {{was carried out in}} an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the measurement system consisted of a PD free transformer, a loop antenna with a frequency bandwidth of 150 kHz– 30 MHz, an ultra log periodic antenna with a frequency bandwidth of 30 MHz– 2 GHz, and an EMI test receiver with a frequency bandwidth of 3 Hz– 3 GHz. According to the experimental results, the frequency spectra of the electrical discharges were widely distributed across a range of 150 kHz– 400 MHz, depending on the defects, while commonly found between 150 kHz and 10 MHz. Therefore, considering the ambient noise and antenna characteristics, the best frequency bandwidth for a measurement system to monitor abnormal conditions by detecting electromagnetic waves in closed-switchboards is 150 kHz– 10 MHz...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Building an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> {{involves}} a substantial investment both financially and in physical space.

The performance of an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> depends on the type, size, and array configuration of the absorber elements {{as well as the}} geometry of the screened room on which the inner surfaces are covered with RF absorbers. If the room geometry is designed such that an electromagnetic ray from the transmitter will only reach the receiver antenna after a few reflections, the wave energy may be sufficiently damped after a few bounces off the absorbing walls and ceiling.

40|$|An <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> has {{recently}} been constructed at the Multimedia University. It is designed to operate over a very wide frequency range from 30 MHz through 18 GHz. It {{can be used for}} electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests, antenna measurements, radar cross section (RCS) measurements, testing RF transceivers, calibration of scatterometers, and other electromagnetic research experiments. The geometry of the chamber is asymmetrical, consisting of a combination of rectangular and tapered volumes. The size of the chamber is about 64 ft x 32 ft x 24 ft high. Ease of construction and ease of lining of the absorbers were preserved so that the actual quietness is comparable to the theoretical simulation result. The transmitting source is placed {{at one end of the}} chamber, and the receiving antenna or object under test is placed in a designated quiet zone at the other end. The walls and ceilings are configured such that no first-order and or second-order reflections (except those reflected from the floor) will propagate into the quiet zone. Hence, less-expensive absorbers can be used to achieve the required wideband performance. Reflection from the floor is required by the international EMC standards for radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission tests; therefore, the chamber is designed for this capability. However, absorbing material can be placed on the floor to convert a semi-anechoic chamber into a fully anechoic chamber for radar and antenna measurements...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Electromagnetic {{shielding}} {{clothes for}} reducing human ex-posure to radio waves have been commercialized. However, their effect {{has so far}} been confirmed only {{in the form of the}} raw material. In this paper, we develop a new compact scheme for measuring electromagnetic radiations using a short dipole antenna and Gaussian pulses in order to evaluate the effect of the shielding clothes over a wide frequency range with the aid of time-domain measurements and FDTD computation. The proposed method is based on a time-domain analysis technique and pulse compression technique, which enables the user to separate the direct trans-mission wave from the reflection from the floor as well as from the refracted wave around the neck of the clothes. The direct advantage is that measure-ments can be made in an ordinary laboratory without the function of an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> Also, we can separate direct transmis-sion wave and diffraction wave from the measurement result by using pulse compression technique, then each frequency characteristic of the shielding shirt can be evaluated. The performance of the separation is confirmed by comparing the measurements with those of a shirt with no opening. We further demonstrate the possibility of predicting the effective conductivity of the material as a function of frequency by comparing the measured re-sults with realistic FDTD computations, which will enable us to design a shielding shirt via numerical means. key words: electromagnetic shielding clothes, time domain measurement, FDTD method, effective conductivity, numerical evaluation scheme 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{imminent}} destructive {{threats of}} Lightning on helicopters and other airborne systems {{has always been}} a topic of great interest to this research grant. Previously, the lightning induced currents {{on the surface of the}} fuselage and its interior were predicted using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method as well as the NEC code. The limitations of both methods, as applied to lightning, were identified and extensively discussed in the last meeting. After a thorough investigation of the capabilities of the FDTD, it was decided to incorporate into the numerical method a subcell model to accurately represent current diffusion through conducting materials of high conductivity and finite thickness. Because of the complexity of the model, its validity will be first tested for a one-dimensional FDTD problem. Although results are not available yet, the theory and formulation of the subcell model are presented and discussed here to a certain degree. Besides lightning induced currents in the interior of an aircraft, penetration of electromagnetic fields through apertures (e. g., windows and cracks) could also be devastating for the navigation equipment, electronics, and communications systems in general. The main focus of this study is understanding and quantifying field penetration through apertures. The simulation is done using the FDTD method and the predictions are compared with measurements and moment method solutions obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center. Cavity-backed slot (CBS) antennas or slot antennas in general have many applications in aircraft-satellite type of communications. These can be flushmounted on the surface of the fuselage and, therefore, they retain the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft. In the past, input impedance and radiation patterns of CBS antennas were computed using a hybrid FEM/MoM code. The analysis is now extended to coupling between two identical slot antennas mounted on the same structure. The predictions are performed using both the hybrid FEM/MoM and the FDTD NEWS code. The results are compared with each other as well as with measurements performed in the <b>ElectroMagnetic</b> <b>Anechoic</b> <b>Chamber</b> (EMAC) of ASU. In addition to self and mutual impedances versus frequency, the comparisons include mutual coupling S(sub 12) as a function of distance for various slot orientations...|$|E
