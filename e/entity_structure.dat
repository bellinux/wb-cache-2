This dissertation presents a systematic approach to user interface design based on this idea. A control flow model for {{the interaction between the}} human and the application is developed and serves as the framework for the proposed approach. Sub-models of the control flow model correspond to actual programming modules and determine the logical system design sequence. The System <b>Entity</b> <b>Structure</b> language is employed to span hierarchical spaces. User interface design is based on the space dimensions of the System <b>Entity</b> <b>Structure</b> pruning process. A Virtual Tree Environment is developed on the TI Explorer to provide a programming facility for implementing user-interfaces. Following the proposed methodology, a system designer can give users an efficient user interface to applications that can be hierarchically described by the System <b>Entity</b> <b>Structure</b> language. The concept can also be implemented on other window systems such as Microsoft Windows and X-windows...|$|E

40|$|Simulation {{validation}} {{remains a}} central and growing challenge, especially when models are large-scale and complex. To advance rigorous simulation validation, {{we have developed}} a component-based modeling environment called Scalable <b>Entity</b> <b>Structure</b> Modeler (SESM), {{which is based on}} the multi-aspect, multi-resolution component-based modeling paradigm. Using a multi-view graphical modeling interface, modelers can specify and compose large and complex models with arbitrary hierarchies. Models can be manipulated and stored directly in standardized relational databases—simplifying model specification and simulation experimentation tasks. A key advantage of a persistent model-base is that it enables modelers to measure a model’s structural and some behavioral complexity metrics (e. g. number and types of components, inputs, outputs, and states of models). A realization of this approach called Scalable <b>Entity</b> <b>Structure</b> Modeler with Complexity Metrics (SESM/CM) is developed. It supports syntactic and semantic correctness of domain-neutral properties of models given a set of well-defined relationships among model components and their interactions. The model components in the model-base can be transformed into XML and subsequently simulation model components suitable for simulation environments such as DEVSJAVA. The scalability and transformatio...|$|E
