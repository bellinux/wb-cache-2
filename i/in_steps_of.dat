5|$|The Ghats in Varanasi are world-renowned {{embankments}} made <b>in</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> stone slabs {{along the}} river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. The ghats are an integral complement to the Hindu concept of divinity represented in physical, metaphysical, and supernatural elements. Varanasi has at least 84 ghats, {{most of which are}} used for bathing by pilgrims and spiritually significant Hindu puja ceremony, while a few are used exclusively as Hindu cremation sites. Steps in the ghats lead to the banks of Ganges, including the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, where Hindus cremate their dead. Many ghats are associated with Hindu legends and several are now privately owned.|$|E
5|$|Varanasi {{has been}} a {{cultural}} centre of North India for several thousand years, and is {{closely associated with the}} Ganges. Hindus believe that death in the city will bring salvation, making it a major centre for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many ghats, embankments made <b>in</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{obtaining a}} BBC licence to produce legacy 11-ohm LS3/5A, Stirling Broadcast {{commissioned}} KEF to produce new T27 and B110 drive units. Stirling had {{to rethink the}} product when KEF finally ceased manufacturing the drive units in about 2000. Working with drivers from SEAS and Scanspeak, Derek Hughes developed for Stirling a new crossover that enabled the new proprietary drivers to mimic {{the response of the}} original KEF drivers they replaced. Specifically, the T27 was replaced by a 19mm doped fabric dome tweeter. The mid–bass unit is a formed polypropylene co-polymer cone to which a damping coating has been applied and given a synthetic rubber roll surround. The crossover has three settings of relative high frequency level, <b>in</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> 0.5dB. Each crossover is tuned to the specific pairs of drive units. While Stirling's revision deviates technically from the specification, the company took steps to research and test to ensure the LS3/5A sound was preserved, [...] "warts and all". Stirling added a [...] "V2" [...] to the designation when the product was launched in 2005 in an act of transparency, even though the broadcaster has endorsed it.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{theoretical}} model of powder canning extrusion with two <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> multiple compress and steady flow {{was built on}} certain conditions based on the porous plastic deformation theory which was given by OYANE. The theoretical analyse and mathematical deduce of the densification process of powder canning extrusion was carried on. The densification expression (dρ/ρ) and hydrostatic pressure (σm) in multiple compress and the extrusion force (p) in steady flow were studied. The results showed that, <b>in</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> multiple compress, the hydrostatic pressure and densification velocity increase with the increasing wall thickness <b>of</b> can. <b>In</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> steady flow, the extrusion force was not only affected by the yield stress of can material and porous body, but also affected by the relative density of porous body and wall thickness of can...|$|R
