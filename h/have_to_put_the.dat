2500|$|In early 1988, Jackson {{organized}} a rally {{at the former}} American Motors assembly plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin, approximately two weeks after new owner Chrysler announced it would close the plant {{by the end of}} the year. In his speech, Jackson spoke out against Chrysler's decision, stating [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> focus on Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic violence!" [...] and compared the workers' fight to that of the 1965 Voting Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama. As a result, the UAW Local 72 union voted to endorse his candidacy, even against the rules of the UAW.|$|E
2500|$|Some area {{residents}} suggested the crossing itself was the problem. Lance Sexton, a Manhattan resident who commutes {{to the area}} to assemble electronic equipment, described using it to The New York Times: [...] "oming down the hill of the cemetery, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> brakes on earlier ... There's a bank there that always collects water, making it even more dangerous." [...] He also {{said he and his}} coworkers often complained about how quickly the train came after the gates went down, gates which had been installed after a 1984 crash killed a van driver. [...] "How safe is that crossing—for this to happen again?" [...] that victim's sister asked the newspaper. While the crossing had undergone upgrades in recent years, including brighter lights and an additional sign warning passing drivers not to stop on the tracks, in 2009 another upgrade, which would have added a sign with flashing lights [...] up the road west of the tracks was not installed. [...] "It's way too early to be guessing about what could have or couldn't have made a difference," [...] said a spokesman for the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{the game}} entered the ELSPA video game charts at number four, then fell to number 19 {{in its second}} week of sale. By 29 November 2008, the game was at number 32 and had sold between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the game sold 356,000 units during October and November placing it fourth amongst all PlayStation 3 {{software}} sales for that period. It entered October's all-platform video game chart at number eight before {{falling out of the}} top 20 by the end of November. Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said [...] "In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> chart in context." [...] Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, LittleBigPlanet was released mid-week and as a result, its first week performance indicators are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, LittleBigPlanet sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009. In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3 million unique users playing LittleBigPlanet. As of March 2010, the game has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. SCEE President Andrew House announced at Gamescom 2010 that the game has now sold over 4.5 million worldwide.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you; that'll do." [...] Then, waiting {{till she}} was gone, {{he crossed the}} room, fumbled open the {{sideboard}} door, {{and took out the}} bottle. Reaching over the polished oak, he grasped a sherry glass; and holding the bottle with both hands, tipped the liquor into it, put it to his lips and sucked. Drop by drop it passed over his palate mild, very old, old as himself, coloured like sunlight, fragrant. To the last drop he drank it, then hugging the bottle to his shirt-front, he moved snail-like to his chair, and fell back into its depths. For some minutes he remained there motionless, the bottle clasped to his chest, thinking: 'This is not the attitude of a gentleman. I must put it down on the table-on the table;' but a thick cloud was between him and everything. It was with his hands he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> bottle on the table! But he could not find his hands, could not feel them. His mind see-sawed in strophe and antistrophe: [...] "You can't move!"--"I will move!" [...] "You're beaten"--"I'm not beat." [...] "Give up"--"I won't." [...] That struggle to find his hands seemed to last for ever--he must find them! After that--go down--all standing--after that! Everything round him was red. Then the red cloud cleared just a little, and he could hear the clock--"tick-tick-tick"; a faint sensation spread from his shoulders down to his wrists, down his palms; and yes--he could feel the bottle! He redoubled his struggle to get forward in his chair; to get forward and put the bottle down. It was not dignified like this! One arm he could move now; but he could not grip the bottle nearly tight enough to put it down. Working his whole body forward, inch by inch, he shifted himself up in the chair till he could lean sideways, and the bottle, slipping down his chest, dropped slanting {{to the edge of the}} low stool-table. Then with all his might he screwed his trunk and arms an inch further, and the bottle stood. He had done it--done it! His lips twitched into a smile; his body sagged back to its old position. He had done it! And he closed his eyes ....|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you nothing as to what {{we are likely to}} do next. As Sholto has given up all his {{prospects}} for me, I cannot honorably desert him. I know now that I have ruined myself for nothing, and I must at least try to hide from him that he has done likewise. I can see that he is not happy; but he tries so desperately to persuade himself that he is, and clings so to the idea that the world is well lost for me, that I have not the heart to undeceive him. So we are still lovers; and, cynical though it sounds, I make him a great deal happier in my insincerity than I could if I really loved him, because I humor him with a cunning quite incompatible with passion. He, on the other hand, being still sincere, tries my patience terribly with his jealousies and importunities. As he has nothing to do, he is almost always with me; and a man who has no office to go to--I dont care who he is--is a trial of which you can have no conception. So much for our present relations. But I fear--indeed I know--that they will not last long. I dare not look steadily at the future. In spite of all that he has sacrificed for me, I cannot live forever with him. There are times at which he inspires me with such a frenzy of aversion and disgust that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> strongest constraint upon myself to avoid betraying my feelings to him. We intended going to the West Indies direct from here, in search of some idyllic retreat where we could live alone together. He still entertains this project; but as I have totally abandoned it I put him off with some pretext for remaining here whenever he mentions it. I have only one hope of gaining a separation without being open to the reproach of having deserted him. You remember how we disputed that Saturday about the merits of a grand passion, which I so foolishly longed for. Well, I have tried it, and proved it to be a lamentable delusion, selfish, obstinate, blind, intemperate, and transient. As it has evaporated from me, so it will evaporate from Sholto in the course of time. It would have done so already, but that his love was more genuine than mine. When the time comes, he will get rid of me without the least remorse; and so he will have no excuse for reviving his old complaints of my treachery.|$|E
