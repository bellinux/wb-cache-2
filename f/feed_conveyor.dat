40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the state of}} the domestic beekeeping. It is proposed, as a paradigm of the industrial beekeeping, to use honey and pollination systems. Over the past 25 years, because the hard economic reforms in the public sector, there was almost double reduction of honey collection. Russian beekeeping is in the hard situation because of the low yields and the use of outdated technologies. Russia's share in the global honey market does not exceed 1 %. A more viable was apiaries of private households. Beekeepers receive a basic income from the sale of honey. Meanwhile, in developed countries more than 60 % of the income of integrated use of honeybees account for pollination activities. In modern conditions of the Russian vector of development of beekeeping should be its production and technological re-equipment, improving its bioecological principles and socio - economic transformation of the infrastructure sector. Using mobile honey- pollination systems, which provide bees with <b>feed</b> <b>conveyor</b> due to the frequent movement of the apiary, honey plant and beekeepers can reduce the cost of manual labor for loading and unloading hives.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In this study, mixing is {{identified}} {{to be the}} most crucial step during the pre-processing process of extruded food and feed stocks. This study therefore aimed to investigate different mixing techniques in an effort to identify the most effective method and its feasibility to pilot plant application for food extrusion processing. The study furthermore considered the methods of mixing with the view to incorporating the identified method in a standard portable cargo container. The research included an investigation and the design of an inexpensive pre-processing control system that would also save space in such applications where storing facilities for ingredients are housed. After investigating different mixing solutions, a V-blender was identified to be a feasible option. It is suggested that by adding a third leg to the V-blender, to obtain what is dubbed as a “Y”-blender, the effectiveness of mixing would be improved upon - not only in the specified application but with respect to mixing in general. In order to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the mixers, rapid prototyping models of a V- and a Y- blender, with capacities of about 7. 6 litres each, were produced from medium density fibreboard (MDF) {{with the aid of a}} laser cutter. It was found that, for a recipe consisting of 87 % fine yellow maize, 12. 75 % fine sugar and 0. 25 % colorant, the effectiveness of mixing within the V-blender was greatly influenced by the level to which it was filled. This was not the case for the Y-blender. This therefore suggested that a Y-blender is the ideal solution for the given application. A layout of a pre-processing system that fits in a standard shipping container and can accommodate six funnel-shaped raw material storage bins with a <b>feed</b> <b>conveyor</b> leading to a Y-blender is designed and a rapid prototyping model of the most vital components of the system is produced.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. With {{the narrow}} margin of profit in the broiler enterprise, how can {{producers}} increase profit potential? It {{is not an}} easy task to answer this question since the net financial return depends on many factors; some are related to the animal, some to the feed, some to the environment and others are outside the production system, like availability and cost of labour and capital. Many researchers have attempted to improve the efficiency of the system using alternative management strategies and to develop a unified theory that could simultaneously evaluate all the relevant factors and the interactions between them. Simulation models are seen as the most promising means of moving this subject forward. Geneticists are continually improving the potential growth rate of broilers, yet there has been little change in feed specifications for these birds over the past few decades. Only recently has it been possible to make use of simulation models to optimise the feeds and feeding programs of modern broiler strains at a commercial level, but little testing of these programs has been carried out. What is needed is a thorough investigation of these models, which at present are based on an individual, as opposed to a population response. Modelling plays an increasingly important part in animal science and research as a way of organizing and evaluating the large body of existing knowledge. With the use of an accurate description of the potential growth rates of broiler genotypes, it is possible to make more efficient use of growth models which are becoming more abundant in the industry and which, in turn, enable the nutritionist or producer to predict the performance of animals when subjected to a given feed or feeding programme. The predictions made by most of the growth models now available are based on individual animals, and the results obtained may be inadequate in optimising the nutrient requirements of a broiler population because of the variation that exists in these populations. Variation in performance traits in broilers {{may be the result of}} variation in the genotype, in the environmental conditions within the house, and in the composition of the feed offered to the birds, and these sources of variation cannot all be accommodated in a model that simulates the food intake and growth of just one bird. But if variation is to be incorporated into growth models, it is necessary to ascertain the effects of variation in the various genetic parameters on the mean response of the population. A sensitivity analysis is useful in accomplishing this objective. Similarly, it is important to know what the optimum size of a simulated population should be, that takes account both of the accuracy of the simulation and the time taken to complete the exercise. This is especially important when optimisation routines are followed, as such calculations are time consuming. As a means of addressing these issues, simulation exercises were conducted using EFG Broiler Growth Model version 6 and EFG Broiler Optimiser Model version 1 (EFG Software, 2006) to determine: (a) whether it is worth generating a population when optimising feeds and feeding programs for broilers, rather than using the average individual, (b) the size of the population required to obtain an accurate estimate of the population response when optimising the feeding program for different objective functions, (c) the effect of changing the value of genetic parameters such as mature protein weight, rate of maturing, feathering rate and the maximum lipid:protein ratio in the gain on the optimum amino acid contents and nutrient densities of broiler feeds, and (d) the effect of variation in nutrient composition of different batches of feed, which have the same nutrient profile but different qualities of the main protein source, on broiler performance. A review of sources of variation in the nutrient content of poultry feed was conducted, and simulation exercises were carried out to determine to what extent broiler performance is affected by the segregation or breakage of pellets into small pieces at the time of delivery and along the <b>feed</b> <b>conveyor</b> within the broiler house, by the change in nutrient quality that might occur along the conveyor, and by the microclimates that develop in a longitudinally ventilated broiler house. The tendency in broiler marketing in most parts of the world is to sell broilers cut up, as portions or deboned after evisceration, rather than selling whole birds. Estimation of the growth rates of carcass parts is therefore of considerable importance if simulation models are to be useful in optimising the feeds and feeding programmes of broilers under different conditions. Allometric equations are used in the EFG broiler growth model to predict the weights of these carcass parts from the weight of body protein at the time. These equations are based on data collected many years ago, and it would be useful to determine whether they are still relevant in the face of announcements by the major broiler breeding companies that tremendous strides have been made in improving breast meat yield, for example, by judicious selection. For the purpose of this investigation it was important to determine to what extent the weights of the physical parts varied at the same body protein weight, thereby enabling a more accurate estimation of the variation that could be expected in these weights when developing a population response model. Towards this end, experiments were conducted to determine the effect of dietary protein content on the performance of Cobb and Ross broilers, including mortality and uniformity, and on the allometric relationships between the physical and chemical components of the body and body protein. The overall objective of these exercises was to address issues relating to the use of simulation models in predicting food intake and growth of broilers, in optimising the amino acid contents and nutrient densities of feeds for broilers, and in representing a population of broilers when the performance of only one bird is simulated at a time...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale of batch system and continuous system {{was developed for}} sludge treatment. Sludge sample from local {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} was chosen as the test material. Okara was chosen as the surrogate sludge sample for the continuous system. This sample was taken from a local beverage manufacturer. Municipal wastewater treatment plants operated by Indah Water Konsortium (IWK) generate a large quantity of sludge. Malaysia generates 3. 2 millions cubic meters of domestic de-watered sludge annually, and this figure will increase to 4. 3 millions by the year 2005. In applying current drying method of sludge wastes using sand bed, which characterised as surface heating, all the heat must pass through its surface to the sludge (external transport phenomena). The difficulty has always been to transfer the heat from the surface into the core of the sludge (internal transport phenomena), which is limited entirely by its inherent properties of poor thermal diffusivity. Microwave drying is characterised as volumetric heating. The microwaves penetrate directly into total mass of sludge and heat volumetrically from inside out. The internal vapour formation creates a higher pressure gradient between the core and the surface, thus increasing the internal transport phenomena. From this study, the microwave energy can be reached deep to the core of sample at smaller radius. Due to partly loss of energy in microwave drying system, the highest efficiency of microwave drying for batch system is 92 % from the ideal value. For the continuous system, moisture extraction rate of 1. 02 kg H 2 O/kWh was achieved when drying was carried out at microwave power of 10. 8 kW and belt speed at 3. 5 m/h.

40|$|Vertical {{transport}} by moist sub-grid scale {{processes such as}} deep convection is {{a well-known}} source of uncertainty in CO 2 source/sink inversion. However, a dynamical link between moist transport, satellite CO 2 retrievals, and source/sink inversion {{has not yet been}} established. Here we examine the effect of moist processes on (1) synoptic CO 2 transport by Version- 4 and Version- 5 NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System (NASA-DAS) meteorological analyses, and (2) source/sink inversion. We find that synoptic transport processes, such as fronts and dry/moist <b>conveyors,</b> <b>feed</b> off background vertical CO 2 gradients, which are modulated by sub-grid vertical transport. The implication for source/sink estimation is two-fold. First, CO 2 variations contained in moist poleward moving air masses are systematically different from variations in dry equatorward moving air. Moist poleward transport is hidden from orbital sensors on satellites, causing a sampling bias, which leads directly to continental scale source/sink estimation errors of up to 0. 25 PgC yr − 1 in northern mid-latitudes. Second, moist processes are represented differently in GEOS- 4 and GEOS- 5, leading to differences in vertical CO 2 gradients, moist poleward and dry equatorward CO 2 transport, and therefore the fraction of CO 2 variations hidden in moist air from satellites. As a result, sampling biases are amplified, causing source/sink estimation errors of up to 0. 55 PgC yr − 1 in northern mid-latitudes. These results, cast from the perspective of moist frontal transport processes, support previous arguments that the vertical gradient of CO 2 is a major source of uncertainty in source/sink inversion...|$|R
