In the second essay, I confirm the theoretical predictions using 1991 - 2011 data before and after a <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> policy change that occurred in 1999 in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Empirical results suggest that both market incentives mentioned above contribute to premium growth. Furthermore, I perform counterfactual analysis to show that average premium would have been 10 % less than observed had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the FEHB program, {{and the federal government}} would have incurred 15 % less in <b>premium</b> <b>contribution.</b> The third essay looks at how capped employer premium subsidies affect the level of adverse selection among consumers. Previous research suggests that the employer <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> scheme can exacerbate or mitigate the level of adverse selection among consumers. Using longitudinal health plan enrollment records of federal civilian employees from years 1997 - 2000, I present empirical results supporting previous theoretical as well as cross-sectional empirical evidence on the dampening effect of a higher employer premium subsidy cap on adverse selection. The overall level of adverse selection, approximated by the different premium levels enrollees select based on their age, does not change significantly over time in the FEHB program...|$|R
40|$|In 1997, {{nearly two-thirds}} of married couples with {{children}} under age 18 were dual-earner couples. Such families may {{have a variety of}} insurance options available to them. If so, declining a high employee <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> may be a mechanism for one spouse to take money wages in lieu of coverage while the other spouse takes coverage rather than high wages. Employers may use these preferences and the size of <b>premium</b> <b>contributions</b> to encourage workers to obtain family coverage through their spouse. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the effects of labor force composition, particularly the proportion of dual-earner couples in the labor market, on the marginal employee <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> (marginal EPC) for family coverage. We analyze data from the 1997 – 2001 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey— Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) List Sample of private establishments. We find strong evidence that the marginal EPC for family coverage is higher when there is a larger concentration of women in the workforce, but only in markets with a higher proportion of dual-earner households.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two seeming paradoxes in {{the realm}} of employer-provided health insurance: First, businesses consistently claim that they bear the burden of the insurance they provide for employees, despite theory and empirical evidence indicating that workers bear the full incidence. Second, benefit generosity and the percentage of premiums paid by employers have decreased in recent decades, despite the preferential tax treatment of employer-paid benefits relative to wages—trends unexplained by the standard incidence model. This paper offers a revised incidence model based on nominal wage rigidity, in an attempt to explain these paradoxes. The model predicts that when the nominal wage constraint binds, some of the burden of increasing insurance premiums will fall on firms, particularly small companies with low-wage employees. In response, firms will reduce employment, decrease benefit generosity, and require larger employee <b>premium</b> <b>contributions.</b> Using Current Population Survey data from 2000 – 2001, I find evidence for this kind of wage rigidity and its associated impact on the employment and <b>premium</b> <b>contributions</b> of low-wage insured workers during a period of rapid premium growth.

40|$|Abstract Background Most of the about 140 million {{informal}} sector workers in urban China {{do not have}} health insurance. A 1998 central government policy leaves it to the discretion of municipal governments to offer {{informal sector}} workers in cities voluntary participation in a social health insurance for formal sector workers, the so-called 'basic health insurance' (BHI). Methods We used the contingent valuation method to assess the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for BHI among informal sector workers, including unregistered rural-to-urban migrants, in Wuhan City, China. We selected respondents in a two-stage self-weighted cluster sampling scheme. Results On average, informal sector workers {{were willing to pay}} substantial amounts for BHI (30 Renminbi (RMB), 95 % confidence interval (CI) 27 - 33) as well as substantial proportions of their incomes (4. 6 %, 95 % CI 4. 1 - 5. 1 %). Average WTP increased significantly when any one of the copayments of the BHI was removed in the valuation: to 51 RMB (95 % CI 46 - 56) without reimbursement ceiling; to 43 RMB (95 % CI 37 - 49) without deductible; and to 47 RMB (95 % CI 40 - 54) without coinsurance. WTP was higher than estimates of the cost of BHI based on past health expenditure or on <b>premium</b> <b>contributions</b> of formal sector workers. Predicted coverage with BHI declined steeply with the <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> at low contribution levels. When we applied equity weighting in the aggregation of individual WTP values in order to adjust for inequity in the distribution of income, mean WTP for BHI increased with inequality aversion over a plausible range of the aversion parameter. Holding other factors constant in multiple regression analysis, for a 1 % increase in income WTP for BHI with different copayments increased by 0. 434 - 0. 499 % (all p Conclusion Our results suggest that Chinese municipal governments should allow informal sector workers to participate in the BHI. From a normative perspective, BHI for informal sector workers is likely to increase social welfare because average WTP for BHI is significantly higher than estimates of the average cost of BHI. We further find that informal sector workers do not value the BHI as a mechanism to recover the relatively frequent but small financial losses associated with common illnesses, but because it protects against the rare but large financial losses associated with catastrophic care. From a behavioural perspective, our results predict that at a price equal to the average <b>premium</b> <b>contribution</b> of formal sector workers 35 % of informal sector workers will enrol in the BHI. Subsidies and changes in insurance attributes (e. g. including catastrophic care and portability) should be effective in increasing BHI coverage. In addition, coverage should expand with rising incomes among informal sector workers in China. Finally, adverse selection will be unlikely to be a large problem, if the BHI is offered to informal sector workers. </p...|$|R
30|$|In China, the Basic Medical Insurance {{program is}} not a {{universal}} entitlement but rather reflects differences in social classes. Retired older people enjoy the highest benefits through BMIE and free medical service, while urban and rural residents in UBMIR and NRCMS are covered by insurance programs with low benefit packages according to their lower <b>premium</b> <b>contributions.</b> This reveals the fact that deep inequity still exists in the current Basic Medical Insurance system. In other words, one major challenge is the significant differences in benefit packages among the elderly in divergent social groups (Lv 2009), resulting in unfairness in the utilization of healthcare services and in health outcomes (Liang et al. 2003; Wang and Long 2010; Gao et al. 2011). We can conclude that high medical-insurance coverage and inequitable benefits coexist, whereas equity in healthcare utilization is weakened due to a higher individual burden of disease (Wang et al. 2005).|$|R

Findings and Conclusions: Partial-repeal legislation that passed Congress but was vetoed by President Obama in 2016 offers some insight but new legislation could go further. It could repeal the ACA's Medicaid eligibility expansions for adults and children but also roll back other provisions, such as simplified enrollment and improvements in long-term services and supports for beneficiaries with disabilities. Additionally, the Trump Administration could expand use of demonstration authority to introduce deeper structural changes into Medicaid, such as eligibility restrictions tied to work, required <b>premium</b> <b>contributions</b> and lock-out for nonpayment, annual enrollment periods, and coverage limits and exclusions.

40|$|As purchasers of the {{majority}} of private health insurance in the U. S., employers {{play an important role in}} choosing health insurance for the under sixty-five population. In this study, I examine the economic incentives facing employers choosing health benefits for employees with heterogeneous preferences for coverage with the objective of determining how the role of the employer affects the health insurance workers receive. I develop and empirically test a theoretical model of employer health benefit purchasing behavior. I find that, while employers have incentives to choose the types of plans employees prefer, heterogeneity among employees in demand for health insurance is costly to employers. The implication is that many individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance receive a plan that deviates from their optimal choice as employers balance the costs of not providing workers with their optimal allocation between wages and health insurance with the incremental costs of providing additional plans. I also find that the institutional features of the employer-sponsored market—the tax treatment of employee <b>premium</b> <b>contributions,</b> combined with nondiscrimination requirements—reduce the extent to which employers offer employees a choice of plans as well as the extent of product variation in the health plan market. I find empirical evidence supporting the theoretical model of employer health benefit choices as a response to employee demand for health insurance. Both the level and variation of characteristics of employees within a firm that affect their demand for health insurance are determinants of the level and variation of the generosity of the health benefits offered by employers. In addition, both establishment and firm size affect employer decisions about whether to offer health insurance, the number of plans offered, and the use of employee <b>premium</b> <b>contributions.</b> The results also demonstrate that characteristics of local labor markets that affect individual demand for health insurance, such as the availability of uncompensated care, also affect employer decisions. I conclude that, in general, employer choices reflect employee preferences for health insurance. However, heterogeneity among employees may result in some workers not receiving the health insurance they desire from their employer. I discuss the implications for employers and policymakers. ...|$|R

40|$|Because {{most workers}} receive health {{benefits}} from their employers, retirement often disrupts health insurance coverage. Some employers offer {{health insurance to}} retirees, but many firms are cutting retiree health benefits by passing more costs to retirees or eliminating benefits altogether. Few alternatives exist. Private nongroup coverage is generally quite expensive, and few people in their 50 s and early 60 s qualify for publicly financed benefits. Many workers who cannot obtain retiree benefits from their own employers or their spouses’ employers delay retirement to age 65, when Medicare coverage begins. This brief examines the availability and cost of health insurance coverage at ages 55 to 64 and changes in coverage after retirement. Today most workers with employer health benefits retain their coverage when they retire early, although their required <b>premium</b> <b>contributions</b> have increased sharply {{over the past ten}} years.
