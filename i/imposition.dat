5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David I, {{particularly in}} the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records. However, the <b>imposition</b> of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the <b>imposition</b> of a manorial system, based on the English model, impracticable.

5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states.

In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt.

Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E

The paper shows a direct correlation between these external <b>impositions</b> and the destructive behavior demonstrated by the young Black male characters. Gaines’ protagonists, who would be exterminated if Whites in power had their way, suffer from psychological trauma due to the pressures described above. This trauma causes these young Black males to act irresponsibly and thoughtlessly. Furthermore, these young Black males receive guidance from older Black males who teach them to accept the <b>impositions</b> of society {{as a method of}} coping with oppression. Also, this examination addresses the author’s metatextual message regarding the social status of young Black males. Over a span of twenty-six years, Gaines depicts characters who continuously worsen and, over time, ultimately disintegrate...|$|R
