5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole <b>folded</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper lies flat.|$|E

She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz, whom Mussburger had {{convinced}} that Norville had stolen the hula hoop idea after giving him his elevator job back. Norville escapes {{to the top}} floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. All of a sudden, Moses stops the clock and time freezes. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him the Blue Letter that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger contains a legal document indicating that Hudsucker's shares would go to his immediate successor, who is now Norville. Moses fights and defeats Aloysius inside the tower, allowing Norville to fall safely to the ground. Norville and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, it is Mussburger who is sent to the asylum while Norville develops a new invention [...] "for kids," [...] an enigmatic circle on a <b>folded</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper that will ultimately turn out to be a frisbee.|$|E

[...] "Empedocles on Etna", again according to Allott, was probably written 1849–52; the notes on Empedocles are likely to be contemporary with the writing of that poem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{mechanical}} properties of randomly <b>folded</b> thin <b>sheets</b> in the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic stress states were studied. It is {{pointed out that}} under the hydrostatic compression the sheet, rigidity is governed by the volume dependence of its enthalpy, whereas in a non-hydrostatic stress state, the rigidity of <b>folded</b> <b>sheets</b> {{is controlled by the}} shape dependence of the Edwards entropy of the network of crumpling creases. Furthermore, the stress relaxation in <b>folded</b> <b>sheets</b> after uni-axial compression was studied. It was found that stress relaxation in <b>folded</b> elasto-plastic <b>sheets</b> differs from this in the <b>folded</b> predominantly plastic <b>sheets</b> and obeys an unusual relaxation law with the universal characteristic exponent...|$|R

2500|$|The 1946–1956 decade was Lionel's Golden Age. The Lionel 2333 Diesel locomotive, an EMD F3 in the {{colorful}} Santa Fe [...] "Warbonnet" [...] paint scheme that {{was introduced in}} 1948, became the Lionel company icon and the icon of the era, yet Lionel declined rapidly after 1956. Hobbyists preferred the smaller but more realistic HO scale trains, and children's interest shifted from toy trains to toy cars. The shift caught Lionel off guard, and in 1957, they hastily introduced a line of HO-scale trains licensed from Rivarossi and a line of slot car racing sets. Neither product line was as popular as its O-gauge trains. Efforts to increase train set profitability and/or sales by cheaper manufacture (largely by replacing castings and <b>folded</b> <b>sheet</b> metal with unpainted injected-molded colored plastic) were largely unsuccessful; 1957 was Lionel's last profitable post-war year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, AMC was {{planning}} a compact coupé utility (pickup) {{based on the}} Hornet {{to compete with the}} increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models. A prototype called the Cowboy was developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The prototype vehicle featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a cargo box with a Jeep logo on the tailgate. The standard I6 engine would be more powerful than the 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups. The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC360 with the 360 V8 and 4-speed manual transmission. It was used by AMC on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to an employee, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front end. However, with the increasing sales of the Hornet models, and the 1970 acquisition of Jeep and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time ALL Jeeps were 4WD), AMC's product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the [...] "uniframe" [...] construction ("frame" [...] rails under the truck bed made of <b>folded</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and incorporated into the cab structure as one piece) resurfaced for the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee.|$|E
