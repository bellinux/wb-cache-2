5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to keep <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; {{the lower the}} oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and {{his friend}} (and CIA agent) Felix Leiter, {{on their way to}} Leiter's wedding in Key West, to have them assist in {{capturing}} drugs lord Franz Sanchez.

Just {{outside the city}} Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded US soldiers in a wrecked truck in the ditch. However, as they attempted to escape further they ran into another North Korean roadblock and were forced to continue on foot, crossing the Taejon River and climbing a nearby mountain. In the confusion, Dean was separated from the group.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the venture}} {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high costs of}} the lavish hand-colored film put <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reach of many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arena to win the match.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co amid a series of board disagreements in 1934. He took control of The Churchill Machine Tool Co and, with Maginness as managing director, in December of that year embarked on a scheme to expand production and replace obsolete machinery, some of it over 20 years old, {{in an attempt to}} achieve an average output figure of £40,000 per month. However, there were difficulties in decision-making and wariness as the clouds of war loomed, most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had done much to assist <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depths of depression.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Kim Collins {{competed in}} his fifth {{consecutive}} Olympic Games, {{and was the}} oldest sprinter at these Games. While most sprinters peak in their 20s, Collins set his personal record after reaching the age of 40, {{and became the first}} individual to run a sub-10 second 100m dash in the process. He ran a 9.93 100m dash, which was fast enough to qualify for Rio. He competed in both the 100m sprint and 4 × 100m relay. Collins was the only St. Kitts and Nevis athlete to make <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first round. He finished his heat with a time of 10.18 and fourth place. He improved his time in the semifinals, finishing with a time of 10.12. This put him in sixth place and he did not advance to the finals.|$|E

The aircraft flew separately to Bahrain, where they made a brief refuelling stop, then continued to Ratmalana Airport and Cocos Island where they refuelled again. One of A84-202's tyres burst while landing at Cocos Island, putting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race.

With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, and is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria. A letter obtained from one of the thieves, reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country. In Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. He continues to Klow on foot, and (with the help of Snowy), restores the sceptre to the King.|$|E
5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands of average consumers. Likewise {{was the case with}} the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E
5|$|US11 and NY41 follow Port Watson Street into {{downtown}} Cortland, {{where they}} meet NY13 at Church Street.

Here, NY13 turns east to follow Groton Avenue (which becomes Clinton Road) {{out of the}} city while US11 and NY41 turns west onto Groton, joining NY222, which begins at the junction of Groton Avenue and Church Street. Here, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city of Cortland. The overlap between NY41 and NY222 ends two blocks later when US11 and NY41 turn north onto Main Street. The two routes remain on Main Street up to Homer Avenue, at which point the two routes veer onto Homer Avenue and follow <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, at which point maintenance of NY41 becomes the responsibility of NYSDOT once more.|$|E
