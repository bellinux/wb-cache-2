5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to <b>Geneva</b> College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927). His coaching record at <b>Geneva</b> was 22 wins, 6 losses and 1 tie, and {{he is a member of}} the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame. <b>Geneva</b> College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history. His teams, renowned for playing some of the best teams in college football, prided themselves on a challenging schedule. <b>Geneva</b> opened the 1926 season with a 16–7 upset of Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Knox {{sent the}} letter to the Queen Regent, he {{suddenly}} announced that he felt his duty was to return to <b>Geneva.</b> In the previous year on 1 November 1555, the congregation in <b>Geneva</b> had elected Knox as their minister and he decided to take up the post. He wrote a final letter of advice to his supporters and left Scotland with his wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in <b>Geneva</b> on 13 September 1556.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{international}} institutions have their seats in Switzerland, {{in part because of}} its policy of neutrality. <b>Geneva</b> is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the <b>Geneva</b> Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland {{is one of the most}} recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in <b>Geneva</b> is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{despite the}} initial {{positive}} {{response to the}} <b>Geneva</b> experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground Rainier shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), became convinced that the <b>Geneva</b> findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy. In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards the <b>Geneva</b> System. While the <b>Geneva</b> experts believed the system could detect underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an official yield of 13 kilotons). As a result, the <b>Geneva</b> detection regime {{and the number of}} control posts would have to be significantly expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of great}} losses during World War I, Charlton opposed {{military}} training and commitments of Australian forces. In 1924 Charlton {{was invited to}} a League of Nations (now United Nations) conference in <b>Geneva,</b> Switzerland.

Upon his return to Australia, Charlton advocated adoption of the protocol, but the government sided with the British and refused to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} that he was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's calling. A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in <b>Geneva</b> for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in <b>Geneva.</b> By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to <b>Geneva</b> for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in <b>Geneva.</b> He spent then {{four years at}} the <b>Geneva</b> Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after <b>Geneva</b> had been annexed to the French Republic. His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E

5|$|During a thunderstorm, {{glass and}} {{porcelain}} items at Marlinspike Hall shatter inexplicably. Insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg {{arrives at the}} house, annoying Captain Haddock. Gunshots are heard in the Hall's grounds, and Tintin and Haddock discover a wounded man with a foreign accent who soon disappears. The next morning, Professor Calculus leaves for <b>Geneva</b> to attend a conference on nuclear physics. Tintin and Haddock use the opportunity to investigate Calculus' laboratory, there discovering that his experiments {{were responsible for the}} glass-shattering of the previous night. While exploring, they are attacked by a stranger, who then escapes; fearing that Calculus is in danger, Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy head for <b>Geneva.</b> In <b>Geneva,</b> they learn that Calculus has gone to Nyon to meet Professor Topolino, an expert in ultrasonics. The group travel there in a taxi, but their car is attacked by two men in another car, who force the taxi into Lake <b>Geneva.</b> Surviving the attack, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy continue to Nyon, where they find Topolino bound and gagged in his cellar. As Tintin questions the professor, the house blows up, but they all survive.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which he could draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around <b>Geneva</b> which he could then incorporate into the story; these included at <b>Geneva</b> Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of <b>Geneva.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1542, Calvin adapted {{a service}} book used in Strasbourg, {{publishing}} La Forme des Prières et Chants Ecclésiastiques (The Form of Prayers and Church Hymns). Calvin recognised {{the power of}} music and he intended that it be used to support scripture readings. The original Strasbourg psalter contained twelve psalms by Clément Marot and Calvin added several more hymns of his own composition in the <b>Geneva</b> version. At the end of 1542, Marot became a refugee in <b>Geneva</b> and contributed nineteen more psalms. Louis Bourgeois, also a refugee, lived and taught music in <b>Geneva</b> for sixteen years and Calvin {{took the opportunity to}} add his hymns, the most famous being the Old Hundredth.|$|E
