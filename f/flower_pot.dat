5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band.|$|E
25|$|Bishopsgate was {{originally}} {{the location of}} many coaching inns which accommodated passengers setting out on the Old North Road. These, though they survived the Great Fire of London, have now all been demolished, though the modern White Hart pub, {{to the north of}} St Botolph's at the junction with Liverpool Street, is the successor of an inn of the same name. Others included the Dolphin, the <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot,</b> the Green Dragon, the Wrestlers, the Angel and the Black Bull. The latter was a venue for the Queen's Men theatrical troupe in the 16th century.|$|E

Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the <b>flower</b> <b>pot</b> in Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.|$|E

2500|$|Lord {{was eager}} to listen; his {{previous}} band had changed their name from The Artwoods to St Valentine's Day Massacre in a desperate effort {{to cash in on}} the gangsters craze that followed the film Bonnie and Clyde. Their cover of Bing Crosby's [...] "Brother Can You Spare a Dime?", released at the end of 1967, had been a failure and he had agreed to make a one-month tour with The <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men, a band promoting the hit [...] "Let's Go to San Francisco".|$|E
2500|$|European naturalists studied crickets {{since the}} 18th century. William Gould {{described}} feeding ant nymphs to a captive mole cricket for several months. The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by Jean-Henri Fabre. Fabre wrote that breeding [...] "demands no particular preparations. A little patience is enough." [...] According to Fabre, home breeding may start {{as early as}} April or May with the capture {{of a couple of}} field crickets. They are placed in a <b>flower</b> <b>pot</b> with [...] "a layer of beaten earth" [...] inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.|$|E
2500|$|The first recruit to {{the band}} was the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, Curtis' flatmate who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and {{including}} Keef Hartley). Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group The <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men (formerly known as the Ivy League), along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper had previously been in Johnny Kidd and the Pirates and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd. Lord put the two on alert that he'd been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met. Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted {{around the same time}} as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.|$|E

6000|$|It is, perhaps, idle {{to attempt}} a summary of those who lived in that house, as one at least will be off, and another in his place, while we are giving them a line apiece. They were usually this kind who lived through the wall from Mrs. Sandys, but beneath her were the two rooms of Hankey, the postman, and his lodger, the dreariest of middle-aged clerks except when telling wistfully of his ambition, which was {{to get out of}} the tea {{department}} into the coffee department, where there is an easier way of counting up the figures. Shovel and family were also on this floor, and in the rooms under them was a newly married couple. When the husband was away at his work, his wife would make some change in the furniture, taking the picture from this wall, for instance, and hanging it on that wall, or wheeling the funny chair she had lain in before she could walk without a crutch, to the other side of the fireplace, or putting a skirt of yellow paper round the <b>flower</b> <b>pot,</b> and when he returned he always jumped back in wonder and exclaimed: [...] "What an immense improvement!" [...] These two were so fond of one another that Tommy asked them the reason, and they gave it by pointing to the chair with the wheels, which seemed to him to be no reason at all. What was this young husband's trade Tommy never knew, but he was the only prettily dressed man in the house, and he could be heard roaring in his sleep, [...] "And the next article?" [...] The meanest looking man lived next door to him. Every morning this man put on a clean white shirt, which sounds like a splendid beginning, but his other clothes were of the seediest, and he came and went shivering, raising his shoulders to his ears and spreading his hands over his chest as if anxious to hide his shirt rather than to display it. He and the happy husband were nicknamed Before and After, they were so like the pictorial advertisement of Man before and after he has tried Someone's lozenges. But it is rash to judge by outsides; Tommy and Shovel one day tracked Before to his place of business, and it proved to be a palatial eating-house, long, narrow, padded with red cushions; through the door they saw the once despised, now in beautiful black clothes, the waistcoat a mere nothing, as if to give his shirt a chance at last, a towel over his arm, and to and fro he darted, saying [...] "Yessirquitesosir" [...] to the toffs on the seats, shouting [...] "Twovegonebeef--onebeeronetartinahurry" [...] to someone invisible, and pocketing twopences all day long, just like a lord. On the same floor as Before and After lived the large family of little Pikes, who quarrelled at night for the middle place in the bed, and then chips of ceiling fell into the room below, tenant Jim Ricketts and parents, lodger the young woman we have been trying all these doors for. Her the police snapped up on a charge; that made Tommy want to hide himself--child-desertion.|$|E

The 'touring' <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men were forced by Deram Records to record songs by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook. As Mark Frumento wrote in the liner notes of the retrospective <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men album Listen To the Flowers Grow (compiled by Carter): [...] "At this point Deram decided that the <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men name was no longer commercial and the next single, [...] "Piccolo Man" [...] was released as 'Friends'.... The final <b>Flower</b> <b>Pot</b> Men single was released in 1969, but this time the writing team Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway were behind the production".
