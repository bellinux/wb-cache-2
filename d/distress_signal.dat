Elites {{intercept}} Halsey's <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> and learn of the existence of Onyx and its Forerunner technology. Both the Covenant and the UNSC forces which arrive at Onyx are attacked by Sentinels. The entire UNSC fleet at Onyx is destroyed by the ensuing battle, save for one stealth ship, the Dusk, which stays hidden, observing the events.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the Allies {{were not}} {{immediately}} {{aware of the}} attack on Behar. Her <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the meantime, Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping in the Indian Ocean and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the change}} in Code Letters in 1934, Centaur was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GMQP. A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was the rescue of the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she {{was in danger of}} being wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{issued a}} media {{statement}} at 07:24 MYT, one {{hour after the}} scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing, stating that contact with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 {{and that the government}} had initiated search-and-rescue operations; the time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01:21. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a <b>distress</b> <b>signal,</b> indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they {{make contact with the}} facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distress</b> <b>signals</b> at sea {{are defined}} in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and in the International Code of Signals.

Upon his arrival in the small Colorado town of Gunnison, he learns that Aliens have begun terrorizing the local populace. His mission is to destroy the Aliens and remove any trace of their activity. After reaching his comrades' ship and erasing its traces from Earth, the Predator's only mission is to exterminate all Aliens in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas steers the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
5|$|Following a <b>distress</b> <b>signal,</b> the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded}} {{in the middle of}} an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

Pimple and Angelica decide to take a leisurely trip on Pimple's flying car. They are ambushed and {{captured}} by the Dark Queen's ship, the Gargantua. Pimple sends out a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> to the Vulture, alerting Professor T. Bird, Rash, and Zitz that himself and Angelica had been captured. Learning that the Gargantua is hidden {{beneath the surface of}} a nearby planet called Ragnarok's World, Professor T. Bird flies Rash and Zitz there in the Vulture to rescue them.|$|E
5|$|Rory Swann is {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of the Hyperion. Swann came {{from a family of}} tech-savvy miners who opened a successful private mining operation on Meinhoff: however, their operation was crushed by ever-rising taxes. Swann lodged a complaint to the Kel-Morian Combine officials and discovered that Tavish Kerr, who's mining operations weren't burden with taxes, bribed officials to put rival claims out of business through excessive taxation. Swann started a miner's revolt, claiming independence from the Kel-Morian Combine. However, Combine forces arrived and mercilessly crushed the revolt. Swann himself lost an arm, along with many friends, and was only saved because Raynor's Raiders responded to their <b>distress</b> <b>signal.</b> Swann had nothing left, so he joined the Raiders.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> {{from the}} Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queena giant {{version of the}} tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} {{and use of}} <b>distress</b> <b>signals</b> is crucial for a boater in any emergency. This situation is intensified {{by the fact that}} boaters are usually not familiar with such devices. Therefore, incorporation of human factors/ergonomics variables into the design of <b>distress</b> <b>signals</b> can be an important element in boater survival. This report presents a systematic method to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of human factors/ergonomics variables in the design of <b>distress</b> <b>signals.</b> The effects of several identified variables were tested individu-ally in the lab and synergistically in a (simulated) on-water emergency. It was found that emergency signals that were designed according to human factors/ergonomics recommen-dations generally required less time to operate than devices that did not follow such guidelines...|$|R

5|$|There {{were also}} recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and Galatea from the {{recommendations}} in his post-battle report. Captain Losack was particularly offended as Schomberg had implied that Galateas <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> was an overreaction {{in the face}} of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear any suggestion of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims that opinion within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which he estimated would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} major effects to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15ft (4.6m), disabled a sailboat with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a <b>distress</b> <b>signal.</b> The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a <b>distress</b> <b>signal</b> to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E
