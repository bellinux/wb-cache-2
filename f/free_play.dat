5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and <b>free</b> <b>play.</b> Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. <b>Free</b> <b>play</b> mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The game's central {{location}} is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport {{bar on the}} planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level {{as well as a}} <b>Free</b> <b>Play</b> mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while <b>Free</b> <b>Play</b> offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out how four {{preschool}} teachers view children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> and its impact on their learning. My main questions are: How do the teachers view the children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing?</b> In what ways does the children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> affect their learning, according to the teachers? This essay is based on a qualitative study in which I have interviewed four female preschool teachers of different ages. I highlight various theories of children’s playing and learning in preschool, by theorists such as Vygotsky, Lillemyr, Knutsdotter Olofsson, Lindqvist, among others. I chose to immerse myself in the teachers' views about children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> and its impact on learning. The result that I found is that the children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> has a great importance in preschool. The teachers have a positive attitude to the children’s <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> and believe that the children proceed from their imagination and creativity when they play. The results regarding the influence of playing in children’s learning, are that the children interact with each other, show empathy and sympathy, and that they learn from each other's experiences...|$|R

50|$|Another method {{involves}} <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> of an instrument. For example, {{a pianist}} might simply sit and start playing chords, melodies, or notes {{that come to}} mind in order to find some inspiration, then build on the discovered lines. <b>Free</b> <b>playing</b> is also used by guitar players, who explore different riffs and licks on the instruments.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and <b>Free</b> <b>Play</b> introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the <b>Free</b> <b>Play</b> wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

40|$|The {{heart rate}} and motor pattern of infants were {{analyzed}} through the daily kindergarten life which is an important phase of infant's and may {{be considered as a}} motor stimulus for growth and development for them. The Subjects were ten male infants, each of their heart rates was recorded continuously by using two telemeters and the results of the observation of their behavior were also written down simulaneously. The kindergarten daily living was divided into five types of activity that were <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> and lesson in outdoor, <b>free</b> <b>playing,</b> lesson and lunch time in indoor. 1. The heart rate distribution of subjects were located between 80 and 200 beats per minute and the mean heart rate was 124 beats per minute. As for the mean heart rate of the 5 types of activity, the outdoor <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> was the highest, which was 147 beats per minute, the outdoor lesson was the second, which was 136 beats per minute, and the indoor activity showed approximately 120 beats minute. 2. As for the appearance frequency of heart rate, no differences were seen between the outdoor <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> and the indoor <b>free</b> <b>playing.</b> During outdoor <b>free</b> <b>playing,</b> high level heart rate more than 160 beats per minute appeared quite frequently. 3. Investigating the motor pattern during <b>free</b> <b>playing</b> by means of behavioral investigation method, the heart rate of the "Kakekko" was also the highest in both of indoor and outdoor. But in the indoor playing, static plays such as "Bura bura aruki", "Suwarikko", "Tachinbo" and "Tsumiki asobi" were most frequently taken up by children, while in the outdoor, dynamic plays using locomotive apparatus such as "Bôru asobi", "Buranko" and "Onigokko" were mostly performed...|$|R

The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.|$|E

25|$|The Sims Stories is {{a series}} of {{computer}} games from The Sims series released in 2007–2008 that is based on a modified version of The Sims 2 engine. This modified game engine is optimized for play on systems with weaker specifications such as laptops. As such, its system requirements are lower than that of The Sims 2, but it can still be played on desktops. One feature of this game, if played on a laptop, is the auto-pause function, which stops and starts the game when the lid is closed and opened, respectively. This series is introduced mainly for three segments of the market: those who wish to play The Sims 2 on their laptops (which usually have lower specifications); those who wish to engage in other activities such as instant messaging while playing the game, and; those who are new to the franchise. In addition to a <b>Free</b> <b>Play</b> mode with classic, open-ended game play, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals in order to progress in the storyline. While Life Stories and Pet Stories each contain two separate stories, Castaway Stories contains one story that is double the length of any one story in the first two games. As an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in The Sims 2. For example, fears are completely removed in all three games, and the elder life stage is completely removed in Pet Stories. Officially, the save files from this series are not compatible with the main The Sims 2 games. However, players have experienced success at adapting some files.|$|E
