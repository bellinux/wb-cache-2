5000|$|Slovene has {{singular}} and plural {{but also}} has the rare dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> a separate form of every noun used when {{there are only two}} such items (except for natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, for which the plural is used). Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> when an ambiguity between dual and plural forms exists, can be rendered into other languages in various ways; comparatively often, there is no ambiguity, and the dual is extraneous. (This explains the relatively early disappearance of the dual in most languages). Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> was a feature of the Proto-Slavic language which has been retained by Slovene. An example of dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> would be [...] "onadva sta" [...] ("The two are"), which refers to two objects or subjects in the masculine gender or [...] "onidve sta" [...] ("The two are"), which refers to the same concept but in the feminine gender. However [...] "oni so" [...] ("They are [...] ") refers to more than two objects or subjects in the masculine gender while [...] "one so" [...] ("They are") does the same the feminine gender. Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> is also preserved in gender. The dual is used consistently in Slovene.|$|R

50|$|All {{languages}} {{are able to}} specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by lexical means with words such as English a few, some, one, two, five hundred. However, not every language has a <b>grammatical</b> category of <b>number.</b> <b>Grammatical</b> <b>number</b> is expressed by morphological or syntactic means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through affixes or <b>number</b> words. <b>Grammatical</b> <b>number</b> may {{be thought of as}} the indication of semantic number through grammar.|$|R

50|$|Linguists {{distinguish}} between {{two kinds of}} universals: absolute (opposite: statistical, often called tendencies) and implicational (opposite non-implicational). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is All languages have pronouns. An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as If a language has trial <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> it also has dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> while non-implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature.|$|R

50|$|In many languages, {{there is}} also a dual number (used for {{indicating}} two objects). Some other <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> present in various languages include trial (for three objects) and paucal (for an imprecise but small number of objects). In languages with dual, trial, or paucal numbers, plural refers to numbers higher than those. However, numbers besides singular, plural, and (to a lesser extent) dual are extremely rare. Languages with numerical classifiers such as Chinese and Japanese lack any significant <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> at all, though they are likely to have plural personal pronouns.|$|R

50|$|Partitive plural is a <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> {{that is used}} {{to modify}} a noun which {{represents}} a part of some whole amount, as opposed to the comprehensive plural, used when the noun represents the total amount of something. This plural form is used in the Finnish language, and its use in this language influenced J.R.R. Tolkien in inventing his fictional language Quenya. It refers to more than one object that is nevertheless only part of a larger number; for example, three out of four of something. It is one of four <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> in Quenya, the others being singular, dual, and plural.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} eye {{movements}} in world-situated language comprehension {{have demonstrated that}} rapid processing of morphosyntactic information – e. g., <b>grammatical</b> gender and <b>number</b> marking – can produce anticipatory eye movements to referents in the visual scene. We investigated how type of morphosyntactic information and the goals of language users in comprehension affected eye movements, focusing on the processing of <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> morphology in English-speaking adults. Participants’ eye movements were recorded as they listened to simple English declarative (There are the lions.) and interrogative (Where are the lions?) sentences. In Experiment 1, no differences were observed in speed to fixate target referents when <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> information was informative relative to when it was not. The same result was obtained in a speeded task (Experiment 2) and in a task using mixed sentence types (Experiment 3). We conclude that <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> processing in English and eye movements to potential referents are not tightly coordinated. These results suggest limits {{on the role of}} predictive eye movements in concurrent linguistic and scene processing. We discuss how these results can inform and constrain predictive approaches to language processing...|$|R
