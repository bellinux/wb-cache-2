In the years 1317-1389 there existed a feudal estate of the Olomouc bishopric. In 1349 Luder, prior of the Dominicans in Brno, bought with his niece Catherine four acres in Troubsko from the citizen named Anselm and donated them to Herbursk monastery. This part of the village administratively separated from the remaining larger part {{for a long time and}} after the transfer of assets of Herbursk monastery to a Jesuit college in the years 1578-1581 it became a part of the estate of Řečkovice. Stated greater part of the village, divided into unequal shares, changed owners frequently, and during the 14th and 15th century was held by members of various noble families - from Křižínkov, from Rohozov, from Svojanov and especially numerous members of the old gentry family from Heršpice. [...] Matyáš Munk from Ivančice bought the whole village and from the year 1573 he is cited as the only owner, until 1609.

40|$|Irrigation {{is a vital}} {{ingredient}} in the modern agriculture, groundwater development through modern water extraction mechanisms (WEMs) have therefore, been receiving greater emphasis in recent past. However, the ownership of private WEMs is confined mostly to the large farmers. The small and marginal farmers and even large farmers with <b>fragmented</b> <b>holdings</b> are buyers of irrigation water from the neighbouring WEM-owners. This has led to spontaneous emergence of groundwater markets. Although the water markets benefit both buyers and sellers in {{one or the other}} way, they have created certain implications in the utilization of this resource. The present study has examined the structure, determinants and efficiency of groundwater markets and has suggested policy options for the realization of equitable benefits from this resource in Western Uttar Pradesh. It is observed that a large proportion (82 %) of the farm holdings enter into one or the other form of water market activities. The number of buyers decreases as the farm-size increases, while the number of sellers increased with the increase in the size of farm. The buying of groundwater is favoured by the farmers with small size and <b>fragmented</b> <b>holdings,</b> low education attainment and less probability of joint-ownership of a WEM. The possibility has been shown of increasing the productivity in major crops like sugarcane and wheat by reducing the excessive water-use on self-users farms, which in turn would increase the availability of water on the buyers ’ farms. The study has identified various policy options which would lead to minimizing the inequitable distribution of benefits and improving the efficiency of water-use under the prevailing groundwater markets system...|$|E

The crop receives almost no inputs, and is grown on residual fertility and moisture and in marginal and exhausted soils. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the area and production of ricebean in Nepal is declining due to the introduction of high yielding maize varieties and increasing use of chemical fertilizers, while consumption is decreasing due to increased availability of more preferred pulses in the local markets. No modern plant breeding has been done and only landraces with low yield potential are grown.

The key {{objective of the}} study was to understand the background to and determining factors in the development of land consolidation (ruilverkaveling) as an instrument of rural planning. Dutch rural planning, as a constituent part of spatial planning in the Netherlands, developed quite separately from urban planning. This article traces the roots of this separate development back to the period 1890 - 1940. At the end of the nineteenth century, reformist liberals argued for a legislative framework for the rational reallocation of land parcels to consolidate <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings.</b> The early initiatives came to nothing because of the prevailing rigid distinction between public and private interests. The First World War changed this situation. The decline in world trade forced the government to make the national economy more self-sufficient.

Instead of a serf-based system of labour, workers were being employed as part of a broader and expanding money economy. The system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit; the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try out better methods, and the tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods, in order to succeed in an increasingly competitive labour market. Land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation, and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{examined}} the effects of land acquisition for large scale farming on the performance; productivity and technical efficiency of small-scale farming in Nigeria. The primary data for the study were collected from 200 small-scale farmers selected using the multistage sampling technique, from three local government areas in Ondo State, Nigeria. The farmers were grouped into Group A: farmers whose families donated land for large scale oil palm project and Group B: farmers whose families did not donate land for the large scale oil palm project in the study area. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, gross margin and stochastic frontier production function analyses. The study revealed that farmers in group A had long distant farms that were in small highly <b>fragmented</b> <b>holdings</b> and produced mainly arable crops that yielded smaller revenue compared with the farmers in group B. It was further revealed that group B farms were more productive in the allocation of resources and over all production as measured by the decreasing positive elasticity of production of most of the variables involved in the production function analysis. The group B farms were also more technically efficient than the group A farms. The study therefore recommends that government should open up the lands on the highways that are not owned by any family for prospective large scale agricultural producers...|$|E

It considers not only technically modern equipment and computer-related problems but also social and economic feasibility. In Albania, the immovable property registration system is {{necessary in order to}} face successfully the new conditions of the free market-oriented economy. For about 50 years, property ownership in Albania was restricted to the State. The 1991 land reform in Albania advanced quickly, and at present over 90 percent of agricultural land is distributed to farmers, though in highly <b>fragmented</b> <b>holdings</b> (totaling an average area average of 2 hectares), creating about 1. 8 million new parcels registered in the cadastral district offices. In urban areas, housing privatization was also completed quickly, creating about 300, 000 new properties in cities, which are being registered in the Hipoteka (deed registry) district offices. Although market transactions in agriculture land are not yet allowed (though enabling legislation is expected to be passed soon), many land transactions have taken place. The housing market is already very active. Conflicts exist, especially in urban areas, between ex-owners of the land and buildings, and the state or present occupants. Therefore, it is highly desirable to establish a property registration system in Albania quickly and yet with careful planning. This paper {{presents the}} registration information system model.

40|$|The {{paper is}} part of an ongoing process of {{estimating}} the GDP of Cyprus and Malta for the interwar period. The islands of Cyprus and Malta have always been considered as similar economically to other South-Eastern European states, despite the lack of historical evidence to prove it. The paper uses recently complied primary sector output estimates for the interwar period (1921 – 1938) to evaluate that the economic structure of the islands was different from each other, as well as from other South-Eastern European states. The output of the agricultural sector per capita indicated that the islands were not keeping up to other Southern-European States. Recovery of the primary sector in Cyprus came from the rapid expansion of copper mining and not from the growth of agriculture. The different growth trajectory of the islands lies partly to their differing economic structure. Malta’s economy was exceptional due to the high urbanisation of the island, leading to the economy’s dependency on the presence of the British navy. Cyprus shared the South-Eastern European problems of high population growth rates, <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings,</b> and poor rural credit institutions which combined in such a way to prevent a shift towards other agricultural products. The inefficiency of the credit system in Cyprus was particularly important in checking the agricultural sector’s growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Northern Bangladesh is {{a remote}} region which was {{excluded}} from the Green Revolution and today remains “ultra-poor”. There is a saying {{in the area that}} the most fortunate people live in Dhaka and Chittagong in the south of the country and the most distressed people live in North Bengal (Northern regions of Bangladesh). North Bangladesh presents a paradox of being too close to the Indian border, which had facilitated trade and commerce in the undivided colonial Bengal, and too far away from Dhaka, the nerve centre of policy, decision-making and politics in Bangladesh. The “policy distance” persists. The Bangabandhu Bridge constructed over the Jamuna River in 1996, creating a vital connection between the North, Dhaka and other agri-commerce centres came several decades too late after the start of the 1970 s Green Revolution.

30|$|Most studies {{revealed}} that non-farm earnings {{account for a}} substantial share of farm household income in rural Africa. There is widespread reliance on non-farm income sources by African farm households (Author and Bryceson 2002). The question {{that needs to be}} justified is that why do households branch out their income? The diversification motives are classified into two; these are pushing and pulling factors (Barrett et al. 2001). Pushing factors include risk reduction, response to diminishing factor returns in any given use, such as family labour supply in the presence of land constraints goaded by population pressure and <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings,</b> reaction to a crisis or liquidity constraints, high transaction costs that influence households to self-provision in several goods and services. Quite the opposite, pulling motive factors comprise the realisation of strategic complementarities between activities, such as crop-livestock integration or milling and hog production. An interrelated but distinct role of diversification is to cope ex-post with distresses to income (Barrett et al. 2001; Ellis 1998; Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001). When crops fail or livestock die, households must reallocate labour to other livelihood pursuits, whether formal employment off-farm (e.g. wage labour), informal employment off-farm (e.g. hunting) or non-agricultural activities on-farm (e.g. weaving, brewing). The auxiliary explanation for diversification is the existence of economies of scope in production. Economies of scope exist when the same factor inputs generate greater per-unit profits when spread across multiple outputs than when dedicated to any one output. On the other hand, an economy of scale leans to favour specialisation rather than diversification (Barrett et al. 2001; Ellis 1998; Kimhi and Lee 1996; Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001).|$|R
40|$|Boundaries are {{inherently}} political creations. Boundaries of {{national parks and}} other protected conservation areas are one such instance. Social boundary lines are also drawn within communities to determine who is legitimate and who is allowed to access resources as a community member. Boundary lines are also present in the stories people tell about themselves and their environment; the portrayal of their roles as land stewards may leave out certain details. The effects of environmental issues such as deforestation and soil erosion transcend such constructed boundaries. Historically, the Benet, as indigenous peoples of eastern Uganda, had derived their livelihood and cultural identity from land-based activities within the forest of Mount Elgon before being resettled by the Ugandan government in 1983. When Mount Elgon National Park was created in 1993, the government discovered that more land had been distributed than the intended 6, 000 hectares. Officially, that surplus land is {{within the bounds of}} Mount Elgon National Park, but people continue to reside and make their living there and the High Court of Uganda has put forth a consent judgment that the Benet have a right to this land. Most members of the community currently derive their livelihood from subsistence farming and grazing in this area. Small, <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings</b> and population pressures, as well as the movement of others from outside the Benet community into this land area, contribute to members of the community continuing to access resources within the national park boundaries illegally. This illegal access use (notably, firewood gathering and grazing of livestock) creates conflict between the community and the authorities controlling the national park and leads to perceptions by government officials that the Benet community is responsible for environmental degradation. I consider, through the analysis of documents, and of interviews and observations undertaken in May and June of 2014, how the resettlement process (and subsequent lack of resettlement for the Yatui, a sub-group of the Benet) is connected to resource use within the national park. What I deem “the land problem” is the combination of a lack of resettlement (or adequate resettlement) and a lack of access to resources necessary for a subsistence livelihood. Using examples from my interviews and analysis, I identify the connections and relationships that resettlement and resource use have to one another and assess possible responses to the land problem...|$|R
40|$|Farm incomes {{in rural}} Vietnam are tightly {{constrained}} by very small farm sizes, highly <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings</b> and cost inefficiency. Despite {{a very successful}} land registration programme, the rental market for cropland {{is considered to be}} inefficient in many parts of rural Vietnam. Given stringent limits on the area of farmland that individuals may own, imperfections in the rental market prevent farmers from consolidating land parcels, growing their farm enterprises, adopting new technology and increasing both their incomes and those of non-farming rural households. The overarching objective {{of this study is to}} examine the efficiency and equity impacts of the cropland rental market in rural Vietnam and the efficiency of the rental market itself. A conceptual framework was drawn from the literature to link policies, tenure security, transaction costs, cropland rental markets and agricultural productivity. A theoretical model was proposed to explain rural household participation in the cropland rental market subject to transaction costs, and testable hypotheses were drawn from this theoretical framework. For empirical analysis, a stochastic frontier model was employed to explain the performance of farming households in rural Vietnam and to examine the effect of cropland rental market participation on this performance. A generalised ordered logit model with shifting thresholds accounting for the effects of transaction costs associated with market participation was specified and estimated using pooled data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys of 2004 and 2008. No previous studies had attempted to measure and test for asymmetric transaction costs in a land rental market. In the context of Vietnam, this study is also the first to measure responses in cropland rental markets since the 2003 Land Law was passed. Some key findings, conclusions and recommendations emerged. First, it was found that the efficiency of the rental market had improved over the study period and rental transactions were creating an emerging commercial farmer class. The survey data showed a trend of increasing participation in the rental market by rural households to adjust their farm sizes, although the level of market participation and the scale of transactions varied across regions. It was concluded that Vietnam’s land reforms over the previous twenty years had done much to strengthen tenure security and it was recommended that the government should step up its efforts to complete the land registration programme. Second, it was confirmed that voluntary rental market transactions had promoted farming efficiency in Vietnam. The results of a stochastic frontier analysis showed that lessees were consolidating and extending their farming operations, and were more technically efficient than lessors. They also showed that crop production could increase by 15 per cent with existing technologies. Third, the study found clear benefits for both lessors and lessees. It was concluded that there was merit in Vietnam’s cautious approach to a land sale market and that a more efficient rental market could contribute significantly to crop production. Fourth, it was found that the rental market, and hence its efficiency and equity benefits, was constrained by high unit transaction costs. Importantly, the results highlight sources of transaction costs that affect lessors and lessees differently, and signal the relative importance of their impacts. Registration of land rights and the application of zoning regulations affect lessors and lessees differently, but their impacts on land use efficiency are unambiguous. These are important sources of transaction costs and it was recommended that, in addition to completing the land registration programme, the government should consider relaxing restrictions on the use of wetlands to grow crops other than rice. Ethnic diversity is also an important source of transaction costs, and more so for lessors than for lessees. However, from a policy perspective, there may be little that the government can do in the short-term to address the issues embedded in ethnic diversity - an area that requires more research. Physical infrastructure is a significant but relatively less important source of transaction costs. It was found that the provision of all-weather roads in communes encourages participation equally on both sides of the market, whereas access to telephones and a local radio station promote only the supply side of the market. It was recommended that public resources should be allocated to commune roads ahead of telephone services and local radio stations, which are also more likely to attract private investors...|$|R

Global emissions from agricultural and forestry sectors account for roughly 22 per cent of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions, which {{is equal to the}} emissions from fossil fuel consumption in the global transportation sector. Reducing emissions from these two sectors presents an opportunity to effectively mitigate carbon emissions with relatively low mitigation costs. In Asia, countries such as China and Indonesia present significant potential to mitigate carbon emissions within these two sectors. Using conservation tillage (CT) and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) programmes as examples of potential options, the objective of this thesis is to enhance our understanding of the challenges associated with mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural and forestry sectors of Asia. In the following paragraphs, I provide a brief outline of my thesis. First, I investigate the socio-economic factors that promote or hinder CT adoption in agriculture using a detailed household level survey of the Huangling County in China. A bivariate probit model with sample selection is applied to analyse farmers’ decision making associated with adopting CT. Results indicate that variables such as government subsidy programmes and household wealth levels {{play a key role in}} the continued adoption of CT. Poorer farmers and those whose neighbours have abandoned CT are more likely to give up on CT. Geographical challenges and <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings</b> lead to only partial adoption, even under government subsidies. Next, the effects of social and economic factors on the time to CT adoption are analysed using survival analysis. To explore further the influence of training programmes and subsidy schemes provided by the Government, villages covered by the survey are divided into two groups based on the level of support received from the Government. The analysis reveals that families who have a higher farm income and those who have attended the training programmes tend to adopt CT earlier. In addition, those who have already adopted CT help with speeding up the adoption process of their neighbours. In terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through REDD programmes in the Indonesian forestry sector, illegal logging is considered as a critical challenge and a threat to the success of REDD projects. A simultaneous-equation econometric model is used to estimate factors causing and promoting illegal logging in Indonesia. The effects from Indonesia’s main timber trading partners, Japan and China, and policies aimed at curbing illegal logging in these countries are also considered as key explanatory factors. The results reveal that corruption and decentralisation in Indonesia have a significant influence on promoting illegal logging supply. Additionally, excess demand in the Japanese construction and furniture industries is a key driver of illegal logging demand. Whereas, in China, an increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) has not necessarily fuelled a proportional increase in demand for illegal logging due to efficiency in wood usage and an increased domestic wood supply resulting from promotion of afforestation in the last two decades. Law enforcement or policies aimed at curbing illegal harvesting in Indonesia are also effective tools. Finally, the potential contributions of the REDD programmes to the global carbon mitigation objective are investigated using an integrated assessment model. It is found that the REDD programmes not only contribute positively towards carbon emissions mitigation through reducing deforestation, they also increase optimal abatement efforts through other conventional abatement. The risk of forest loss, however, makes the REDD option less attractive. The insights derived from the optimisation model suggest that, while investing in REDD, countries with lower risk but higher opportunity costs of REDD programmes should be preferred over countries with higher risk but lower opportunity costs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in the crop and livestock production system interactions of smallholders upon fixed and <b>fragmented</b> land <b>holdings</b> in livestock and human populated area of Alaba, Southern Ethiopia {{with the objective of}} quantifying the major feed resources and evaluating the efficiency of utilizations of these feeds. General linear model (GLM) was fitted for dry matter yield of private grazing lands of the household in tonnes over covariates household grazing land size and number of households’ livestock in TLU for each type of livestock’s. Models were fitted for crop residues dry matter yield and aftermaths of the households including utilization efficiency and all were significant. Average family size of the households was 8. 52 with literacy of the households’ leaders’ value of 52. 5 % for the Woreda overall. Mean holdings of total lands did not vary between the two farming systems significantly (P > 0. 05) but land use systems varied between the two study sites significantly (P 0. 05) with Pepper / Wheat /Livestock farming system having higher values than Teff / Haricot bean /Livestock system. Similarly, livestock holding in tropical livestock unit (TLU) and total dry matter (DM) productions of feed resources were significantly different between the two study sites (P 0. 05) and the major sources of feeds for livestock near to 78 % are obtained from crop residues followed by grazing lands. In this regard rate of cultivation of lands is far great for Teff / Haricot Bean /Livestock system and significant differences of crop residues yield was observed between the two study sites (P< 0. 05). Results are based on 114 sample households’ surveyed in the two great strata of the Woreda called farming systems at two seasons which varied mainly on the types of commodities they produce and species of animals’ dominance. The results of the models showed that the following variables with the corresponding P-value in the bracket were found to have a significant effect over the dependent variable dry matter yield of grazing land, household grazing land size in hectar (< 0. 0001), numbers of household livestock in TLU for horse (0. 03), mature female donkey (0. 04), and for dairy cows (0. 07). Livestock feed balance in terms of dry matter yield showed that a total of 1, 224. 6 tonnes of dry matter are produced for a total TLU values of 1, 128. 2 making their ratio to 1. 09 but in actuality 3, 178 tonnes of dry matter is required for the surveyed existing stocks regardless of the nutritional content of the dry matter. Quantification estimate clearly showed that the time of abundant feeds availability in the Woreda is only five months. Seasonal variation of feed is high and efficient utilizations of what is produced is still quite less than 65 % because of non-storage of crop residues during crop harvest, wastage by trampling and lack of improvement {{of the quality of the}} feed. Plots of, private grazing lands in front of homestead are usually the main sources of feeds for livestock, during cultivation and hence is over grazed. Nearly, 64 % of the surveyed households have problems of shortages of water and travel from half- a day during dry period. High production of crop residues dry matter that make the two systems complement to one another, locally available sodic soil of the area called bole in addition to better livestock market out let is an existing opportunity. Forage development is a key to skip feed shortages if practiced but it is at an infant stage in terms of usage in the study areas and the main reasons of which are highly attributed to shortage of land, seed and knowledge gap. Interventions to utilize locally available potential feeds, better access to forage and fodder development, water development and quality improvement of straws are optioned as a way out to profit from the livestock sector in the study areas. Nevertheless, these are not only enough unless backed up institutionally as a strategy for consistent and persistent monitoring. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesEthiopia {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in Africa to implement large-scale land titling programmes aiming to improve land related-investments. Since 1995, Ethiopia also has partially liberalised rural land rental markets with the aim of improving the functioning of these markets. Evidence on whether these reforms resulted in improved land access by the poor and increased land-related investments though are scarce and inconclusive. This thesis investigates empirically the relationship between land tenure issues on one hand, and land-related investments and the functioning of rural land and labour markets on the other. It also analyses the relationship between participation in land rental markets and household welfare. Detailed descriptive data analysis and various econometric models were used to examine these issues. The data source for the study is the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey (ERHS), which consists of a panel of 1477 sample households covering four regions in the country. Findings from the study show that factor, input, and financial markets are poorly developed in rural Ethiopia. In addition, land title ownership does not give farmers additional rights other than the rights provided in the federal and regional legislation. This has particular ramifications. For instance, despite having a land title, farmers in Ethiopia are not allowed by law to sell or use their land as collateral in credit markets. There are also various limitations on land rental transactions. These findings suggest that the preconditions for economic effectiveness of land titling are not satisfied in the case of Ethiopia. Furthermore, in contrast to earlier studies, this study finds no significant link between farmers' perceptions of tenure insecurity and their land-related investment and factor market participation decisions. Instead, it establishes that poverty in faming resources and market failures in the credit and factor markets are the major binding constraints that adversely affect farmers' land-related investment and factor market participation decisions in rural Ethiopia. The results reveal that asset rich households were more likely to get access to more land and labour through factor markets, and they were also more likely to invest on their land, while female-headed and/or asset poor households were more likely to lease out their land and remain poor. The findings of this study do not necessarily suggest that the existing land tenure system in Ethiopia is satisfactory for farmers' intensification efforts. It is widely argued that past and current land polices in the country have led to reduced and <b>fragmented</b> land size <b>holdings</b> in rural areas. As a result, there is limited room for farm intensification. For instance, data from this study show that among sample households who did not grow tree crops on their land, 40 % of them reported that land shortage is the first major problem. In this regard, the existing land tenure system can be equally restrictive for most farmers. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that, without reforming the existing land policy and addressing problems in factor and credit markets, land titling is expected to play a very limited role in improving tenure security, investment, and land access for the rural poor...|$|R
