40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to analyze the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen (CHNS-O) content of compost derived from Isfahan-Iran {{municipal}} solid waste using thermal elemental analyzer and to develop an approximate <b>empirical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> for the organic fraction of the mature compost as a function of its elemental composition. Materials and Methods: The compost samples (1 kg) were collected from different parts of the windrows and thoroughly mixed in accordance with standard methods.

The moisture content, temperature, and pH value were also monitored in three different windrows during the process. Results: An approximate chemical empirical formula calculated for the organic fraction of the compost was: C 204 H 325 O 85 N 77 S. Conclusion: According to this formula, it appears that the mature compost produced in the site contains higher value of nondegradable nitrogen, which leads to a lower total C/N ratio.

40|$|Recently, {{coal-fired}} power plants have considered either to retire themselves or to use natural gas as {{the main energy source}} instead of coal due to more stringent air pollution regulations for nitrogen oxides (NO_(x)), mercury (Hg) and more recently the required CO_(2) reduction of 30 % by 2030. Clean coal technology must be continuously developed in order to prevent people from losing their jobs and to decrease the negative impacts of firing coal on environment. The present research focuses on NO_(x) emissions which arise mainly due to oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen using low NO_(x) burner (LNB) when fired with Wyoming Powder River Basin coal (PRB) and blends of coal and dairy biomass (DB). The DB was selected as co-fired fuel for possible elimination of DB from dairy feedlots which result in land, air and water pollution if not properly disposed of. LNB adopts staged air introduction in order to limit the availability of oxygen when nitrogen from fuel is released. To achieve the objective, the mixing patterns between fuel particle and air were predicted using non-reacting flow (NRF) simulation inside the cylindrical combustion chamber. The effects of varying burner parameters, fuel particle sizes, main burner equivalence ratios (ER_(mb)) and overall equivalence ratios (ER_(oa)) on mixing characteristics were investigated. Then, the LNB components were modified based on the results from NRF simulation. The modified main burner is a partially premixed swirl burner (fuel mixes with the primary air inside the fuel/primary air nozzle, and the secondary air is swirled by the straight-vane swirler) whose swirl angle and secondary air swirl number are 59 ? and 1. 42 respectively. The circular over-fire air (OFA) nozzles are located 484 mm below the main burner exit, and the OFA is injected into the combustion chamber in the radial direction. The fuels used in the research were: 1) pure PRB and 2) the fuel blend of PRB and DB with the PRB-to-DB ratio of 90 to 10 on mass basis (90 - 10 PRB-DB blend). Fuel characteristics were first obtained, and <b>empirical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> were deduced. The CO_(2), O_(2) and NO were measured as a function of ER_(oa) and ER_(mb) (ER_(mb) based on air flow without inclusion of OFA). The gas analyses were used to obtain the burnt fraction, respiratory quotient (RQ, = CO_(2) moles produced/O_(2) moles consumed) and equivalence ratio which is then checked against measured values. Uncertainty analyses were also performed. The optimum conditions for minimum NO_(x) emission that pass the EPA limit (210 g/GJ) were obtained as follows. With ER_(oa) = 0. 95, firing pure PRB produced NO_(x) 220 g/GJ without OFA, and 179 g/GJ with OFA (ER_(mb) = 1. 10) which is about 18. 6 % reduction. Under same conditions, the co-firing of 90 - 10 PRB-DB blend decreased NO_(x) by 3. 6 % without OFA, and 22. 2 % with OFA (ER_(mb) = 1. 10) compared to firing pure PRB at ER_(oa) = 0. 95 without OFA. Furthermore, co-firing 90 - 10 PRB-DB blend with OFA at ER_(mb) = 1. 10 and ER_(oa) = 0. 95 (excess air 5. 26 %) emitted NO_(x) approximately 171 g/GJ whilst firing pure PRB without OFA at ER_(oa) = 0. 85 (excess air 17. 65 %) emitted NO_(x) approximately 330 g/GJ which is 48 % reduction and less than 210 g/GJ (the current EPA limit). This reduction could benefit 500 -MWt power plants approximately $ 113, 500 per year in case the efficiency of power plants is 35 % and NO_(x) are traded at $ 15. 89 per short ton...|$|R

40|$|Yttriaite-(Y), ideally Y_(2 _O_(3), {{is a new}} mineral (IMA 2010 - 039) {{from the}} {{alluvial}} deposits of the Bol’shaya Pol’ya River, Subpolar Urals, Russia. The new mineral occurs as isolated crystals, typically cubo-octahedra < 6 µm in size, embedded in massive native tungsten. Associated minerals include: copper, zircon, osmium, gold, and pyrite. The main forms observed are { 100 } and { 111 }. Due to the crystal size, physical properties could not be determined; however, the properties of synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) are well known. Synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) crystals are colorless to white with a white streak; crystals are transparent with an adamantine luster, while massive Y 2 O 3 is typically translucent with an earthy luster. Synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) has a Vickers hardness of 653. 91, which corresponds to 5. 5 on the Mohs scale. Synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) crystals have good cleavage on { 111 }. Yttriaite-(Y) is isotropic; the refractive index measured at 587 nm on synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) is n = 1. 931. The <b>empirical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> (mean of 4 electron microprobe analyses) calculated {{on the basis of}} 3 O is: Y_(1. 98) Dy_(0. 01) Yb_(0. 01 O 3). Yttriaite-(Y) is cubic, space group Ia 3 (overbar), with parameters a = 10. 6018 (7) Å, V = 1191. 62 (7) Å 3, and Z = 16. The five strongest lines in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (measured on synthetic Y_(2) O_(3) using synchrotron radiation) are [d_obs in Å (I) (hkl) ]: 3. 0646 (100) (222), 1. 8746 (55) (440), 1. 5984 (38) (622), 2. 6537 (26) (400), and 4. 3356 (14) (211).

50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> {{is a way}} {{of expressing}} {{information}} about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> is not a chemical name, and it contains no words. Although a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> may imply certain simple chemical structures, it {{is not the same as}} a full <b>chemical</b> structural <b>formula.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>formulas</b> can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of molecules and chemical substances, and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.|$|R

For example, one systematic name for glucose is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucose's structural formula, but the name is not a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas.</b> Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.|$|R
