2500|$|The Colt Python is {{a double}} action handgun {{chambered}} for the [...]357 Magnum cartridge, built on Colt's large <b>I-frame.</b> Pythons {{have a reputation for}} accuracy, smooth trigger pull, and a tight cylinder lock-up. [...] They are similar in size and function to the Colt Trooper and Colt Lawman revolvers.|$|E
50|$|P-frame is {{the name}} to define the forward Predicted pictures. The {{prediction}} is made from an earlier picture, mainly an <b>I-frame,</b> so that require less coding data (≈50% when compared to <b>I-frame</b> size).|$|E
50|$|Typically, every 15th frame or so is {{made into}} an <b>I-frame.</b> P-frames and B-frames might follow an <b>I-frame</b> like this, IBBPBBPBBPBB(I), {{to form a}} Group Of Pictures (GOP); however, the {{standard}} is flexible about this.|$|E
50|$|This is {{incremented}} for successive <b>I-frames,</b> modulo 8 or modulo 128. Depending on {{the number}} of bits in the sequence number, up to 7 or 127 <b>I-frames</b> may be awaiting acknowledgment at any time.|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 a {{illustrates}} {{a case where}} two types of frames - <b>I-frames</b> and P-frames - were used to compose image sequences, and Figure  7 b depicts a case where three types of frames - <b>I-frames,</b> P-frames, and B-frames - were used to compose image sequences.|$|R

50|$|An <b>I‑frame</b> (Intra-coded picture), a {{complete}} image, like a JPG or BMP image file. P and B frames hold {{only part of}} the image information (the part that changes between frames), so they need less space in the output file than an <b>I‑frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typical {{frequency}} of <b>I-frame</b> - 500ms.|$|E
50|$|High-speed seeking {{through an}} MPEG-1 video is only {{possible}} to the nearest <b>I-frame.</b> When cutting a video {{it is not possible}} to start playback of a segment of video before the first <b>I-frame</b> in the segment (at least not without computationally intensive re-encoding). For this reason, I-frame-only MPEG videos are used in editing applications.|$|E
50|$|P-Frame - Stores {{differences}} between <b>I-Frames</b> or other P-frames.|$|R
40|$|Most of the MPEG {{watermarking}} schemes {{can only}} be embedded into <b>I-frames.</b> The other frames will not be marked. Different attacks like frame rate changing can change the frame type of the marked <b>I-frames.</b> Thus the watermark could be detected from wrong <b>I-frames.</b> Due to these attacks an important issue of digital watermarking solutions for MPEG video is the temporal synchronization of the video material to the proportions before the attacks to detect the watermark successfully. The synchronization information can be embed {{as part of the}} information watermark or as a second watermark. The weakness point is with the destruction of the synchronization information the watermark can not be detected more. We provide a solution which analyzes the <b>I-frames</b> based on a robust image hash system. The hash solution was developed for JPEG images and can also be used for MPEG <b>I-frames</b> because of their similar structure. The hash values are robust against common manipulations, like compr ession, and can be used to detect the marked frames also after manipulations at the video material. We analyze the usability of the image hash system and develop a concept based on video and MPEG properties...|$|R
30|$|Encryption ratio: <b>I-frames</b> alone occupy about 30 to 60 % of {{the whole}} video stream, which is quite high. Thus, no {{important}} encryption saving is achieved. It is suggested that reducing <b>I-frames</b> frequency could achieve better encryption efficiency; on the other hand, this will adversely impact compression performance and random acquisition delay in case of channel change.|$|R
5000|$|The typical Group Of Pictures (GOP) {{structure}} is IBBPBBP... The <b>I-frame</b> {{is used to}} predict the first P-frame and these two frames are also used to predict {{the first and the}} second B-frames. The second P-frame is predicted also using the first <b>I-frame.</b> Both P-frames join together to predict the third and fourth B-frames. The scheme is shown in the next picture: ...|$|E
5000|$|LAPDm allows no {{more than}} one {{outstanding}} unacknowledged <b>I-frame</b> (GSM 04.06 Sections 5.8.4 and 6).|$|E
50|$|MPEG-1 {{has several}} frame/picture types that serve {{different}} purposes. The most important, yet simplest, is <b>I-frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|Often, <b>I‑frames</b> {{are used}} for random access and are used as {{references}} for the decoding of other pictures. Intra refresh periods of a half-second are common on such applications as digital television broadcast and DVD storage. Longer refresh periods {{may be used in}} some environments. For example, in videoconferencing systems it is common to send <b>I-frames</b> very infrequently.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I‑frames</b> are {{the least}} {{compressible}} but don't require other video frames to decode.|$|R
5000|$|P-frames and B-frames need less data than <b>I-frames,</b> so less data is transmitted.|$|R
50|$|In most designs, {{there are}} two types of inter frames: P-frames and B-frames. These two kinds of frames and the I-frames (Intra-coded pictures) usually join in a GOP (Group Of Pictures). The <b>I-frame</b> doesn't need {{additional}} information to be decoded and it can be used as a reliable reference. This structure also allows to achieve an <b>I-frame</b> periodicity, which is needed for decoder synchronization.|$|E
5000|$|... less {{important}} frames (B-frame) from the buffer are dropped before {{the more important}} frames (<b>I-frame</b> and P-frame), ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I-frame</b> - This is the {{fundamental}} and most complete frame type, which stores all data and from which motion changes are described.|$|E
5000|$|P‑frames can use {{data from}} {{previous}} frames to decompress {{and are more}} compressible than <b>I‑frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|MPEG-2 {{includes}} three basic types of coded frames: intra-coded frames (<b>I-frames),</b> predictive-coded frames (P-frames), and bidirectionally-predictive-coded frames (B-frames).|$|R
5000|$|<b>I-frames</b> {{contain an}} entire image. They are coded without {{reference}} to any other frame except (parts of) themselves.|$|R
50|$|If a video {{drastically}} {{changes from}} one frame {{to the next}} (such as a cut), it is more efficient to encode it as an <b>I-frame.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>I-frame</b> only {{compression}} is very fast, but produces {{very large}} file sizes: {{a factor of}} 3&times; (or more) larger than normally encoded MPEG-1 video, depending on how temporally complex a specific video is. [...] <b>I-frame</b> only MPEG-1 video {{is very similar to}} MJPEG video. So much so that very high-speed and theoretically lossless (in reality, there are rounding errors) conversion can be made from one format to the other, provided a couple of restrictions (color space and quantization matrix) are followed {{in the creation of the}} bitstream.|$|E
5000|$|Live HDTV feed {{contribution}} (<b>I-frame</b> only {{video compression}} with low transmission latency), such as live HDTV feed of a sport event {{linked to the}} TV station studio ...|$|E
3000|$|In most {{experiments}} the {{convolutional code}} {{is not able}} to recover <b>I-frames,</b> which translates into the lost of almost all frames of the GOP.|$|R
5000|$|Information frames, or <b>I-frames,</b> {{transport}} user {{data from the}} network layer. In addition they can also include flow and error control information piggybacked on data.|$|R
30|$|Visual degradation: since intraframes {{are very}} {{important}} in MPEG compression (all B- and P-frames are computed accordingly to <b>I-frames),</b> by encrypting them, high-visual degradation is achieved.|$|R
50|$|I-Frames (Information frames): Carries upper-layer {{information}} and some control information. <b>I-frame</b> functions include sequencing, flow control, and error detection and recovery. I-frames carry {{send and receive}} sequence numbers.|$|E
50|$|Darius and Mary Robertson House, a 2-story <b>I-frame</b> {{house built}} circa 1880 in the Harrisburg {{community}} outside of Sevierville. Buckner {{did most of}} the house's original interior design work.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{data rate}} of an <b>I-frame</b> is 1 bit per pixel while {{that of a}} P-frame is 0.1 bit per pixel and for a B-frame, 0.015 bit per pixel.|$|E
50|$|S-Frames (Supervisory Frames): Carries control information. S-frame {{functions}} include requesting and suspending transmissions, {{reporting on}} status, and acknowledging {{the receipt of}} <b>I-frames.</b> S-frames carry only receive sequence numbers.|$|R
5000|$|... the {{transmission}} of <b>I-frames</b> is delayed when conditions are bad, {{even if they are}} out-of-date w.r.t. the display time (they can still be used to decode subsequent interpredicted frames).|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the first}} version, VCE 2.0 adds H.264 YUV444 (<b>I-Frames),</b> B-frames for H.264 YUV420, and {{improvements}} to the DEM (Display Encode Mode), which results in a better encoding quality.|$|R
