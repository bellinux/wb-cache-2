6000|$|Again Ralph's eyes flashed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have insults heaped {{upon his}} own head, {{but when they}} touched his mother---- ...|$|E
60|$|I don't know, that's {{just the}} awful part of it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> before. I knew the worst Cohen could do, but now.... It couldn't be Paradine.|$|E
60|$|I {{was glad}} to be free of that job. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have to go into these dens to arrest men, let alone living with them, almost being one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk {{of those}} horrors before my daughter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to have to}} do such things, without {{speaking}} about them afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes! And {{throw the}} whole day after the half, and lose my rehearsal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to lose my temper. I swore, I can tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{one should}} have any {{correspondence}} on a journey; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have to write, but the receipt of letters is the death of all holiday feeling.|$|R
60|$|George writhed. The knife {{twisted in}} the wound. Surely <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to see a}} happy man eating bread and {{marmalade}} without having {{to listen to him}} talking about marriage.|$|E
60|$|Ralph shivered at the thought. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be shot}} at, but to {{be burned}} out! He wished {{daylight}} would come and his father would return with the much-needed aid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} comfort. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{for that}} short distance. It would be {{something}} awful if {{it had to be}} kept up for a fortnight. How long shall we be before we get to Irkoutsk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] she cried, [...] "I am a most wicked woman. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{that one}} should misuse you. Ma foi! I will {{see that there is}} not a second one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is right," [...] said Ermine; [...] "I am {{thankful that}} {{he is out of}} reach of trying to take a share in the nursing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have one in the midst!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Literally for Figuratively. [...] "The stream was {{literally}} alive with fish." [...] "His eloquence literally swept the audience from its feet." [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to exaggerate, but {{to affirm the}} truth of the exaggeration is intolerable.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS (distractedly). Why, that's {{just what}} I can't tell. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> {{when they were}} all filled up, but now since the people have begun {{to come out of}} them, {{and some of them are}} made into seats I can't tell.|$|E
6000|$|As she paddled {{her mind}} cleared, {{and she was}} able to {{consider}} the position. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough.</b> She saw no light, darkness hemmed her in. But at least she had a week before her, and meanwhile what should she write to Geoffrey? ...|$|E
6000|$|Really, {{if it had}} {{not been}} for the pig, that {{shocking}} question might have led to a mutiny in the school-room. When <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to do the thing, how could anyone ask what was meant by the operation, and why it was performed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate to {{hear you}} say 'the force,' Mark, just as if you were still a detective; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that you should have belonged to it, even for the purpose you did; but you have done with it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, Etooelle, I do not. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> entre nous; and Nelson is {{very welcome}} {{to stay on}} board his Foudroyant; voilà!--The enemy is in council; we shall soon hear from them. Adieu, mon ami; {{remember}} our two Républiques!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' Hampton said shortly, 'Hawtrey told me. I {{was very}} glad to hear it, {{for this sort of}} thing might have been started on an even bigger scale if she had married him, and might have ruined her life altogether. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>it</b> is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{never said}} otherwise,' he answered, rather crossly; 'but {{you know very}} well that it is a farce to talk of her {{managing}} the house, or the estate either. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> before, but there will be no check on any one now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The chief {{did not say}} so," [...] {{broke in}} Benita with agitation; [...] "besides, if he had, I should not have cared. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to see one man killed like that," [...] and she shivered; [...] "I could not bear any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh, piston-ring burnt off {{and put the}} exhaust-valve on the blink. That {{means one}} {{cylinder}} out of business," [...] growled Hawk Ericson. [...] "I could fly, maybe, but I don't like to risk it in this wind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> this morning when I tried it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is my only comfort," [...] Mrs. Marryat said. [...] "If <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> a cadetship, I {{should have}} written {{to say that}} I would not let you go. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>it</b> is; {{but if you had}} had to fight, I could not have borne it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I {{disturbed}} you. I am really not unconventional--though certainly no slave to convention. Still there <b>are</b> limits [...] . <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to intrude in this way, and I {{do not know}} what you can say or think of the time selected, for the intrusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am pleased, indeed," [...] Mr. Murray said, when Gregory {{told him}} of his appointment. [...] "It is better than I even hoped. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> there, in the {{position}} of an officer, but <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> infinitely worse in any other capacity. Do you want to draw any money?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{felt as if}} {{her aunt}} were {{striking}} her blow after blow on a sensitive, quivering spot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to know it all, but to hear it put into such cold, brutal words was more than she could endure. It seemed to make everything so horribly sure.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not think}} how easy it might be to prove himself {{innocent}} of all wrong-doing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to be suspected. Besides, {{he had not been}} the only one to hear the harsh words that had been spoken, and in a moment a crowd had collected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that {{exposure}} {{was a terrible}} thing for him," [...] returned Phil. [...] "Of course what he did wasn't as bad as what was done by Nick Jasniff and those two robbers, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough.</b> I'd hate {{to have such a}} black mark against my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not so bad}} as we thought," [...] said he, [...] "and yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough.</b> I {{have about}} ten days to find the money, but I don't know which way to turn for it. Pearson, however, lied, as usual, when he spoke of L13,000. The amount is not quite L7,000." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} do {{anything}} with them if I were restored in this way; {{they would be more}} set against me. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but, even for my own peace, I believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better to leave it alone. All my comfort in school is over, I know!" [...] and he sighed deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not quite}} sure," [...] replied Harold, with a rueful look, [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{absolutely}} the worst fix, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough.</b> The worst of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that this Yambo has let these rascals off {{with all our}} fire-arms and camp-equipage, so that we are absolutely helpless--might as well be prisoners, for we can't quit this village in such circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. Perhaps {{it was a}} good {{paper and}} perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to make Homer turn over in his grave. I've studied and mulled over {{notebooks}} until I'm incapable of forming an opinion of anything. How thankful little Phil will be when all this examinating is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not in this respect,' said Tom Pinch. 'You must excuse me, John. I cannot, really; I will not. It's very wrong; {{you should}} be more guarded in your expressions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> when you and I used to be alone together, but under {{existing}} circumstances, I can't endure it, really. No. I cannot, indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [NOTE: John Galsworthy said of this work: [...] "'The Burning Spear' was {{revenge of}} the nerves. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to have to bear the dreads and strains and griefs of war." [...] Several years after its first {{publication}} he admitted authorship and it {{was included in the}} collected edition of his works. D.W.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] {{he said to}} {{the chief}} of police, [...] "to kill an {{innocent}} man, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible that he should have murdered a creature who <b>was</b> dead already. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> for me to have slain a Mussulman without having it on my conscience that a Christian who is guiltless should suffer through my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{who wants}} to be foretold the weather? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> when <b>it</b> comes, without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand. The prophet we like is the old man who, on the {{particularly}} gloomy-looking morning of some day when we particularly want <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> fine, looks round the horizon with a particularly knowing eye, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> at first. You {{have had}} a heavy trial indeed, poor Emma; but what is a trial but {{something}} to try us? Would <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> more manful to face the pain of going home, and to take up your allotted work? Then you would be submitting, not to a self-made rule, but to Heaven's own appointment.' ...|$|R
