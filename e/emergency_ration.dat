Until then, the division had the remains of their two days' special <b>emergency</b> <b>ration,</b> which had been carried in sandbags on their saddles. Ration transport had been [...] behind the division; 'A', 'B' Echelons, the Divisional Transport Train, and Ammunition Column bivouacking for the night at Shellalif on 19 September. The special camel convoy had been unable to keep up, and its provisions were distributed elsewhere. By the evening of 20 September rations had also been delivered to the 5th Cavalry Division at Aujah by motor lorry via the Musmus Pass, while 'A' Echelon and the Divisional Transport Train were bivouacked at Qaqun.|$|E
500|$|By 17 September the 5th Cavalry Division, {{which would}} lead the advance, was {{deployed}} north-west of Sarona, [...] from the front line, with the 4th Cavalry Division in orange groves to the east, [...] from the front, and the Australian Mounted Division in reserve near Ramleh and Ludd, [...] from the front line. All movement, restricted to the night hours, culminated in a general move forward {{on the eve of}} battle during the night of 18/19 September, when the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona. The supplies for the three divisions concentrated in the rear in divisional trains, in massed horse-drawn transport and on endless strings of camels, clogging every road in the area. One iron ration and two days' special <b>emergency</b> <b>ration</b> for each man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain for each horse, was carried on the trooper's horse, with an additional day's grain for each horse, carried on the first-line transport limbered wagons.|$|E
2500|$|A BEF manual {{published}} on 8 May 1916 (SS 109, Training of Divisions For Offensive Action), described successions of lines to add driving {{power to the}} attack, to reach the objective with the capacity to consolidate the captured ground against counter-attack. In the Fourth Army Tactical Notes of May 1916, battalions were allowed to attack on a front of [...] in [...] about [...] apart. Supporting lines were {{to pass through the}} leading ones, to avoid excessive demands on the energy and ability of individual soldiers. Weight of numbers was rejected as a tactic; each platoon was to carry half the burden of a brigade attack for a few minutes, before being relieved by a fresh wave. Platoons were divided into functions, fighting, mopping-up, support and carrying; the fighting platoons were to press on as the moppers-up secured the ground behind them. Support and carrying platoons could pick their way through artillery barrages with the tools and weapons needed to consolidate and defeat German counter-attacks. Some troops in carrying platoons had about [...] of equipment and tools, whereas troops in the advanced platoons carried a rifle, bayonet, [...] of ammunition, iron ration (an <b>emergency</b> <b>ration</b> of preserved food, tea, sugar and salt), two grenades, pick, shovel or entrenching tool, four empty sandbags, two gas helmets, wire cutters, a smoke candle and a water-bottle. In the French army, the experience of 1915 showed that despite the power of French bombardments, infantry would enter a chaotic environment, full of German pockets of resistance and individuals who had been by-passed. By mid-1916 much of the French infantry in the Sixth Army had been trained as specialists, as rifle-and-bayonet men, bombers, rifle grenadiers or light machine-gun crews. Attacking waves were spread wider and companies trained to manoeuvre in small groups, to get behind surviving German defences, as [...] (trench cleaners) armed with hand-grenades and revolvers, searched captured ground for stray Germans and hidden machine-gunners, although such methods did not come into general use until later in the year.|$|E

50|$|Military {{chocolate}} {{has been}} a part of standard United States military ration since the original Ration D or D ration bar of 1937. Today, military chocolate is issued to troops as part of basic field rations and sundry packs. Chocolate rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized <b>emergency</b> <b>ration.</b> Military chocolate rations are often made in special lots to military specifications for weight, size, and endurance. The majority of chocolate issued to military personnel is produced by the Hershey Company.|$|E
50|$|When {{provided}} {{as an emergency}} field ration, military chocolate {{was very different from}} normal bars. Since its intended use was as an emergency food source, it was formulated so {{that it would not be}} a tempting treat that troops might consume before they needed it. Even as attempts to improve the flavor were made, the heat-resistant chocolate bars never received rave reviews. <b>Emergency</b> <b>ration</b> chocolate bars were made to be high in energy value, easy to carry, and able to withstand high temperatures. Withstanding high temperatures was critical since infantrymen would often be outdoors, sometimes in tropical or desert conditions, with the bars located close to their bodies. These conditions would cause typical chocolate bars to melt within minutes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>rations</b> are {{items of}} food and drink that a person stores and relies on {{in case of an}} emergency.

The rations are to help people survive until help arrives and are often carried while hill walking or mountaineering, because of the risk of being stranded by an accident. In some organised events, such as Ten Tors, it is obligatory to carry <b>emergency</b> <b>rations.</b>|$|R

As of May 1, 2005 Stella's earlier black chocolate was take out of service.

5000|$|While {{fighting}} in the European Theater of Operations, the US Army discovered that troops also quickly got tired of the K-ration, some being forced to eat it for days, or rarely, in excess of a week on end. As {{it was based on}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>ration,</b> the K-ration provided roughly 800-1,200 calories fewer than required by highly active men, especially those working in extreme heat or bitter cold, and malnutrition became evident. [...] The problem was exacerbated by insistence on a rigorous issue of a single K-ration per day rather than supplying additional K-rations for active men. [...] The packaging of the K-ration into separately described daily meals may have intensified this problem by leading commanders to assume that daily caloric intake was sufficient. [...] An extensive 1943 field report from the European theater noted that none of the packaged rations were recommended for continued use by active troops for periods in excess of 10 days. [...] A survey of troops in the forward areas and evacuation hospitals of the Fifth U.S. Army serving in the Italian campaign noted that almost all soldiers questioned in infantry, engineer, and other mobile forward units said they had lost weight {{since the beginning of the}} Italian campaign. Surgeons commented upon a noticeable decrease in body fat and wasting of muscle, requiring copious feeding and rest, as well as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) deficiency.|$|E
