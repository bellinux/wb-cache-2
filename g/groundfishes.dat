40|$|Adjacent to Chile’s {{long and}} narrow {{continental}} shelf, the Patagonian Inner Sea (PES) {{is among the}} largest and most complex estuarine systems in the world. The PES harbours high concentrations of juveniles and adults of important <b>groundfishes,</b> which spawn within or in near proximity to it.

40|$|We compare {{results of}} bottom trawl surveys off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1977, 1980, 1983, and 1986 to discern trends in {{population}} abundance, distribution, and biology. Catch {{per unit of}} effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length compositions for 12 commercially important west coast <b>groundfishes</b> are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature {{on the distribution of}} <b>groundfishes</b> is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, rex, and Dover soles (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.

40|$|All {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} platforms have finite economic life spans. One of the decommissioning options for these platforms is complete removal, requiring the use of explosives to dislodge the support structure from below the seafloor. Off California, this decommissioning option would kill large numbers of platform-associated and commercially important <b>groundfishes</b> that inhabit the bases of the platforms, and may potentially affect regional fish populations. Capturing and translocating fishes before removing a platform might mitigate the effects of platform removal. In this study, we acoustically tagged 79 rockfishes and lingcod from three oil platforms in the east Santa Barbara Channel and translocated them to a natural reef inside a state marine reserve at Anacapa Island to determine whether individuals would home back to their platforms of capture, or take up residency at their new location. Movements between natural and platform habitats were monitored over a two-year period. Twenty-five percent of all tagged fishes translocated to a natural reef returned to their home platforms relatively quickly, traveling distances from 11 km to ≥ 18 km, in 10. 5 h to 17 d.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Skates (Rajiformes: Rajoidei) are an {{extremely}} {{diverse group of}} cartilaginous, marine fishes that are common mesopredators in benthic communities. Population declines, shifts in assemblage structure, and ecological interactions with exploited <b>groundfishes</b> have focused increased scientific and management attention on skates. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to address a knowledge gap in the ecology of eastern North Pacific (ENP) skates, and thereby inform the development of improved monitoring and management strategies for exploited skate stocks off the U. S. West Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska. Chapter 1 investigated spatial associations of ENP skates in continental shelf and upper continental slope waters of each study region. Chapter 2 focused on the other aspect of the traditional niche by examining trophic relationships within each skate assemblage and among distant populations of big and longnose skates. The goal of this chapter was to address the paradox of ecological redundancy in skates (i. e., skates occupy similar habitats and eat similar prey). Chapter 3 utilized an improved understanding of ENP skate ecology to establish baseline information for the development of fisheries management strategies. Space appears to be more important than food in structuring ENP skate assemblages. Spatial segregation among sympatric skate species and their life stages was demonstrated off central California and in the western Gulf of Alaska. In contrast, ENP skate assemblages displayed a high degree of trophic redundancy, with the timing and location of collection trawls explaining the great majority of dietary variation. Species-level and length-based differences were highly significant, but explained a relatively minor portion of the observed dietary variability, especially in the western Gulf of Alaska. Big and longnose skates had different predatory roles in each region, with a greater reliance on decapods in the Gulf and fishes off California. Distribution and abundance patterns of U. S. West Coast skate species and their life stages were modeled and can be used to characterize essential fish habitat. Updates to a Gulf of Alaska food web model indicated that skates (especially big skate) are major predators of Tanner crab and may considerably influence regional trophodynamics...|$|E

The harvesting, processing, and marketing of fish and fish products has historically {{played a significant role in}} the regional economy of New England. While this industry is less im-portant now than in earlier times, it still gener-ates significant income and employment; pro-duction of fresh and frozen fish involves over 11, 000 seasonal (8, 700 equivalent full-time) jobs and accounted for over 600 million dollars in product sales in 1983.

Recent declines in halibut biomass, particularly in the GOA, have exacerbated concerns about levels of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) in <b>groundfish</b> fisheries because of the potential effect on other user groups. Pacific halibut PSC limits can limit fishing activity on targeted <b>groundfish</b> fisheries or affect fishing practices. Affected <b>groundfish</b> fisheries include 1) Pacific cod trawl and longline fisheries, 2) shallow-water flatfish complex and arrowtooth flounder trawl fisheries, and 3) rockfish trawl fishery. In some target fisheries, PSC limits are not typically fully used, while other fisheries are typically closed prior to attainment of the target <b>groundfish</b> catch limit because they have fully used their PSC allowances. The overall halibut PSC limits in the GOA have not been revised since a 2, 000 metric tons (mt) (4. 4 Mlb) trawl cap was implemented in 1989 and the hook-and-line cap was reduced to 300 mt (661, 000 lbs.) in 1995 when the halibut and sablefish Individual Fishery Quota program was implemented.
