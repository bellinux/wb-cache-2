40|$|Throughout Indonesia’s {{independence}} history, {{discourse on}} secularization of politics arises constantly and draws a widespread appeal from many researchers. Conceptual issues pertaining to separation between Islam and state (secularism) {{and how it}} is realized, have been able to make the secularization of politics one of the most dynamic objects of research and directly reach the socio-political reality of the Indonesians. In the pluralistic society, quandaries emerge oftentimes as to make the religious and nationalist commitments converge. Even though inseparable, the government frequently designates Islam as opposing to nationalism. Islam has been charged with a symbol of exclusivism and anti-diversity. Islam has even been regarded as the second political enemy after communism and thus requires its elimination. This is hence the pretext for imposing the secularization. Islam is consequently separated from political concern and its adherents are discarded from any policy-making process. This article seeks to both elucidate the secularization and analyze its propagation in Indonesia spanning the time prior to its independence until the present time. In this section, the articles finds out that secularization in Indonesia proceeds as a top-down movement enforced by the ruling towards the ruled; the Muslim society. In the following section, the article also <b>discloses</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the secularization and exposes a groundwork for its impending failure. In reference to the secularization project in Turkey, the article reveals that separation of Islam and state in Indonesia falls short due to absence of support from the Muslim grass-root...|$|R
30|$|The 2002 Elbe River {{floods in}} Germany and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in the United States are {{prominent}} examples illustrating that for DRR-related organizations effective policy implementation {{is as important}} as making the right policy. The river floods and the hurricane not only exposed the vulnerability of highly developed countries to natural hazards but also <b>disclosed</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in social learning and applying knowledge. In both countries, the investigation of DRR and response processes characterized the responses to the two events as “a failure of initiative” rather than “a failure of knowledge” (Weichselgartner and Brévière 2011). But there is, of course, a nexus between the two. Both knowledge and initiative require information and a coordinated process for sharing it. The disasters highlighted shortcomings in effectively transferring organized information into applied knowledge, that is, knowledge into wisdom. Katrina was known to be headed to New Orleans several days before the hurricane made landfall, and the potential damage had been known and understood years ahead of time (Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina 2006). Yet the socioeconomic and political impacts of the hurricane were enormous. In April 2006, the Elbe River again caused severe damage—despite a comprehensive lessons-learned process initiated shortly after the Elbe River floods in 2002 (DKKV 2004). The failure to mitigate and respond more effectively to natural hazards—which in both cases had been predicted in theory for many years, and forecast with startling accuracy for days ahead of time—underlines the importance of addressing the distinct domains of disaster risk reduction, knowledge management, and social learning together.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} whether {{participation in a}} competitive voucher programme designed to improve access to and quality of sexual and reproductive health care (SRH-care), prompted changes in doctors' knowledge, attitudes and practices. METHODS: The voucher programme provided free access to SRH-care for adolescents. Doctors received training and guidelines {{on how to deal}} with adolescents, a treatment protocol, and financial incentives for each adolescent attended. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on doctors, nearly all participating doctors (n = 37) were interviewed before the intervention and 23 were interviewed after the intervention. Answers were grouped in subthemes and scores compared using nonparametric methods. RESULTS: The initial interviews <b>disclosed</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in doctors' knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to adolescent SRH-issues. Gender and age of the doctor were not associated with the initial scores. Comparing scores from before and after the intervention revealed significant increases in doctors' knowledge of contraceptives (P = 0. 003) and sexually transmittable infections (P < 0. 001); barriers to contraceptive use significantly diminished (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 003); and some attitudinal changes were observed (0 = 0. 046 and P = 0. 11). Doctors became more aware of the need to improve their communication skills and were positive about the programme. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed provider related barriers that adolescents in Nicaragua may face and reinforces the importance of focusing on the quality of care and strengthening doctors' training. Participation in the voucher programme resulted in increased knowledge, improved practices and, to a lesser extent, in changed attitudes. A competitive voucher programme with technical support for the participating doctors can be a promising strategy to prompt change. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

In the field of Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization, most recent systematic search has been devoted to fixed topology parametric geometries, pertaining to a single concept, with very little stress put on the optimization of variable topologies describing alternative design concepts. The search is conducted in a highly novel manner, generating a broad range of combinations of UAS configurations and geometries by systematically searching alternative concepts and design configurations through the parameterization of the aircraft geometric topologies. Moreover, the “value” of proposed solutions is assessed in an objective way both from performance and economic perspectives, while the optimal solution is identified after relaxing all of the design constraints as advocated by value driven design philosophy.

Feng et al.

In line with this notion, our results show that firms <b>disclosing</b> internal control <b>deficiencies</b> and those restating financial highlights report less accurate management forecasts in the Japanese market, where the disclosure of management forecasts are effectively mandated. Furthermore, we find that manager's optimistic biases cause such inaccurate management forecasts. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of internal controls has a significant impact on internal reports, which are used in forming forecasts; therefore, internal control weaknesses induce less accurate management forecasts. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) {{mandates}} management {{evaluation and}} independent audits of internal control effectiveness. The mandate is costly to firms but may yield benefits through lower information risk {{that translates into}} lower cost of equity. We use unaudited pre-SOX 404 disclosures and SOX 404 audit opinions to assess how changes in internal control quality affect firm risk and cost of equity. After controlling for other risk factors, we find that firms with internal control deficiencies have significantly higher idiosyncratic risk, systematic risk, and cost of equity. Our change analyses document that auditor-confirmed changes in internal control effectiveness (including remediation of previously <b>disclosed</b> internal control <b>deficiencies)</b> are followed by {{significant changes in the}} cost of equity that range from 50 to 150 basis points. Overall, our cross-sectional and intertemporal change test results are consistent with internal control reports affecting investors' risk assessments and firms' cost of equity.

Acceptance test levels are set with margin expected flight/operations levels and qualification test levels are set above the expected operation levels to check for the survivability of DC brush motor in space. Performance testing is important to design and integration in a planned test process in which DC brush motor were tested under actual or simulated mission profile environments to <b>disclose</b> design <b>deficiencies</b> and to provide information on failure modes and mechanisms. Statistical models are helpful in this process. The Logistic Regression Model is the commonly used parametric statistical models {{and is one of}} the statistical techniques that are used for analyzing and predicting performance with binary outputs. The objective was to develop Logistic Regression Model and is designed to examine the categorization of dependent variables in the quantitative analysis for the performance of DC brush motor. The work carried out demonstrates the development of the Logistic Regression Model for performance prediction of the DC brush motors for deploying unfurlable antenna. The methodology includes performance test data and transforming the dependent variables into binary digits. And to estimate the probability of success of DC brush motor. The model developed is useful in the GO-NO-GO decision making with regard to the DC brush motors which is one of the critical components in the space module. This paper adds value to the decision making process through statistical validation using Logistic Regression Model. This Model helps the decision makers in qualifying the components based on performance tests. The Model developed shows the working condition of motor can said to be good since the model fit is good.

In this study, the recently characterized human DECTIN 1 Y 238 X early stop codon polymorphism leading to diminished Dectin- 1 receptor activity was studied in relation to invasive aspergillosis susceptibility and severity in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We found that the presence of the DECTIN 1 Y 238 X polymorphism in either donors or recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation increased susceptibility to aspergillosis, with the risk being highest when the polymorphism was present simultaneously in both donors and recipients (adjusted hazard ratio = 3. 9; P =. 005). Functionally, the Y 238 X polymorphism impaired the production of interferon-? and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), in addition to IL- 1 ß, IL- 6, and IL- 17 A, by human peripheral mononuclear cells and Dectin- 1 on human epithelial cells contributed to fungal recognition. Mechanistically, studies on preclinical models of infection in intact or bone marrow-transplanted Dectin- 1 knockout mice revealed that protection from infection requires a distinct, yet complementary, role of both donor and recipient Dectin- 1. This study <b>discloses</b> Dectin- 1 <b>deficiency</b> as a novel susceptibility factor for aspergillosis in high-risk patients and identifies a previously unsuspected role for Dectin- 1 in antifungal immunity that is the ability to control both resistance and tolerance to the fungus contingent on hematopoietic/nonhematopoietic compartmentalization...|$|R

Definition of the primary structure of MCAD and the tissue distribution of its mRNA is of biochemical and clinical importance because of the recent recognition of inherited MCAD deficiency in humans. The MCAD mRNA nucleotide sequence was determined from two overlapping cDNA clones isolated from human liver and placental cDNA libraries, respectively. The MCAD mRNA includes a 1263 -base-pair coding region and a 738 -base-pair 3 '-nontranslated region. A partial amino acid sequence (137 residues) determined on peptides derived from MCAD purified from porcine liver confirmed the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the human MCAD cDNA with the partial protein sequence of the porcine MCAD revealed a high degree (88 %) of interspecies sequence identity. RNA blot analysis shows that MCAD mRNA is expressed in a variety of rat (2. 2 kilobases) and human (2. 4 kilobases) tissues.

The long-term clinical, laboratory, and developmental observations revealed that after 5 years of apo-TF supplementary therapy the patient's anemia gradually disappeared, {{and he started to}} grow again without further therapy. Immunoelectrophoretic study <b>disclosed</b> a severe <b>deficiency</b> of both TF and haptoglobin in the patient. The recovery from his anemia and the resumption of his physical development were dependent only on his TF level: that is, from a negligible level it increased to 10 - 20 mg/dl (normal, 205 - 370 mg/dl), a level similar to that of his TF-deficient siblings, who had been in good health since birth. The TF analysis of the patient and his family suggests that the minimum TF requisite in this family may be close to 10 - 20 mg/dl; subjects with more than 20 mg/dl are apparently healthy; with less than 10 mg/dl they may develop severe growth retardation and anemia, and extreme deficiency may be lethal. Also, coexisting haptoglobin deficiency might alleviate hemosiderosis. Further, the isoelectric focusing study disclosed that there was only a small amount of TF variant in these siblings including the patient. The study of the family confirmed that this variant was produced by an allelic gene derived from their father. So, the original diagnosis of congenital atransferrinemia should be revised as familial hypotransferrinemia transmitted with autosomal recessive mode, and the subjects with a recessive character may be compound heterozygotes of the "variant" allele and the "null" allele...|$|R
40|$|The non dormant- 1 (nd- 1) mutant of {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) {{is characterized}} by an albino and viviparous phenotype. Pigment analysis by spectrophotometer and HPLC demonstrated in nd- 1 cotyledons the absence of ß-carotene, lutein and violaxanthin. Additionally, we found a strong accumulation of zeta-carotene and, to a lesser extent, of phytofluene and cis-phytoene in nd- 1 seedlings grown in very dim light (1 µmol m- 2 s- 1). These results suggested that -carotene desaturation was impaired in the mutant plants. To understand the molecular basis of the nd- 1 mutation, we cloned and characterized the zeta-carotene desaturase (Zds) gene from sunflower. A reconstructed full-length sequence (1, 916 bp) of the Zds cDNA was obtained from homozygous Nd- 1 /Nd- 1 wild-type plants. It contains a 1, 761 -bp CDS, 62 nucleotides of 5 '-untranslated region (UTR), and 77 nucleotides of 3 '-UTR. The predicted protein (64. 9 kDa) consists of 587 amino acid residues with a putative transit sequence for plastid targeting in the N-terminal region and a typical amino oxidase domain that includes the flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) binding motif. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the sunflower Zds was clustered to marigold (Tagetes) Zds gene, for which it showed an overall aminoacidic identity of 96. 6 % and resulted strictly correlated with other Zds sequences of higher plants. Interestingly, RT-PCR analyses showed that nd- 1 plants were unable to accumulate Zds transcripts. Sequence information from the Zds cDNA was used to design specific primers and to isolate the full-length exons/introns region of the gene. The sunflower Zds gene (HaZds) comprises 14 exons and 13 introns scattered in a ca. 5. 0 -kb region. Also, HaZds showed a high conservation of the distribution {{and size of the}} exons with rice Zds gene.

Among the duties {{assigned to the}} PCAOB was “conducting inspections of registered public accounting firms. ” A strategy for such inspections was developed that includes reporting deficiencies judged to be significant for supporting conclusions made. This paper presents a content analysis of <b>deficiencies</b> <b>disclosed</b> in the nine inspections (during three years) of three accounting firms, along with the largest four firms, that are inspected each year. Also discussed are the general implications for auditing teaching in colleges/universities and in continuing education programs in public accounting firms. There is no attempt in this paper to evaluate the PCAOB inspection process {{in relation to the}} responsibility as stated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, except for some comment in the concluding segment. Furthermore, there is no discussion of quality control deficiencies, since those are not revealed in inspection reports that are provided on PCAOB’s Website. Among the conclusions of the analysis of the nine inspections are the following: Auditing is a generic process and auditors must understand that process through initial instruction that is engaging, relevant and meaningful. The auditor needs to internalize the basic simple concept that “an audit is {{more than the sum of}} its parts,” and the process is applicable across many types of entities. Professional guidance is not properly understood or if understood, not implemented in practice. Deficiencies provide evidence of failure to do what is expected. A concept-driven education/training strategy is needed. The reality of actually participating in the performance of an audit demands that learning be both conceptual and practical. Critical operational concepts must be reflected in instruction. These are: a. need for comprehensive understanding of the entity and its environment; b. understanding that an audit is more than the sum of its parts. Its parts, therefore, cannot be evaluated in isolation of other parts; c. value of corroborating evidence d. evidence requires assessment and evaluation; and e. criteria (GAAP, etc.) must be carefully reviewed (in basic source documents) to be assured of proper interpretation in financial reporting...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Luton, Luton Business School, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis provides {{an examination of the}} managerial policies adopted by the Egyptian tourism sector in planning and implementing the repositioning of the image of Egypt from the mid 1960 s onwards. It aimed at augmenting its traditional cultural identity with an additional hedonistic dimension, derived from the development of beach resort tourism on the Red Sea coast. In addition to exploring the specific elements of the Egyptian repositioning, including an evaluation of its success, the study seeks to identify from the analysis, the key issues and managerial requirements involved in the repositioning of destinations in general, and proposes a preliminary model of the content and sequencing of the repositioning process. The study employed a qualitative methodology involving ethnographic fieldwork with key informants, chosen as representatives of the main categories of stakeholders who participated in Egyptian tourism planning of the repositioning programme. It took its direction and procedures from an adaptation of Grounded theory, in which three main sources of data were collected and appraised: ethnographic interview responses, direct observation, and documentation generated both internally and externally. The results revealed by this study suggest that, though total tourist flows generally increased after the repositioning, and the proportion of tourists visiting the Red Sea beach resorts, rather than the cultural locations, also increased, the lack of proper evaluation mechanisms of the programme made it difficult to attribute causally these changes to public sector managerial decisions, rather than to other variables in the broader external environment (world tourism growth trends, power of the international operators, price competitiveness, etc.). Moreover, in analysing the mechanics of the programme, a number of key areas of deficiency in strategic planning and marketing practice were identified. These deficiencies included: weak or non-existent marketing research; poor market targeting and product portfolio analysis; inadequate planning and evaluation procedures; weak communication, and integration of effort between stakeholders; and limited awareness of cutting edge promotional practices. The normative model of repositioning offered {{at the end of the}} Results section of this study seeks to address some of the problems and <b>deficiencies</b> <b>disclosed</b> in the Egyptian case study, by suggesting some of the desiderata of best practice when destinations need to augment, modify, or change their image...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} into everyday conception of personal relationships has been sparse and fragmented, {{and the various}} specialisms fail {{to deal with the}} broader issue of interpersonal understanding. Following review of the research and theoretical background, with particular reference to changing paradigms, a holistic approach is proposed for an exploration linking the content of explanation and reflection about relationships with the incidence of conceptualising. The methodology, employing content analysis, illustrative studies and a musical analogue, is outlined. Initially focusing on verbalised conception in the form of accounts, a procedure of 'simulated correspondence with a confidant' was employed to facilitate unrestricted disclosures in general descriptions of relationships. Three coding schemes were devised for content analysis of accounts (and for independent use in subsequent research). These pertained to: (1) specific concepts and themes; (2) explanation of interpersonal effect and significance; and (3) inter-subjectivity in accounts. Overall indications from the content analyses are that accounts are characterised by superficiality of detail and insight, and concentrate more on basic viability, and on social and visible aspects of personal relationships than on intimate and psychological aspects. The limitations of content analysis, and the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>disclosed,</b> suggest attention should be given to omission in content as much as inclusion, and also to the prior issues of motivation and the extent of relationship 'mindfulness'. A musical analogy (with particular reference to representation, knowledge and appreciation) is employed to advance the exploration beyond the linguistic aspects of conception to a more general model of relationship awareness. A second set of studies turn to (1) the frequency and occasioning of reflection on relationships; (2) reappraisal over time; (3) interest in relationships compared with other subjects of general interest; and (4) factors which disincline conscious relationship deliberation and analysis. There are indications throughout of a sex difference, with men as less reflective, less inclined to participate in providing accounts, and less interested in personal relationships. Disincentives are suggested, and a theory of 'relationship mindlessness' is discussed, connecting impoverishment of content and incidence with the late emergence of 'personal relationships' as a subject of formal scholarly enquiry in psychology. It is proposed that such mindlessness, and associated disincentives, are implicated in relationship problems, and that extension of relationship education, knowledge and interest are indicated. The practicalities and possible form of learning about relationships and consciousness-raising were explored in a trial relationship understanding course. Counter-indications for such consciousness-raising were evaluated by analogy with music appreciation. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} made of three {{chapters}} which contribute to the international accounting literature. The first chapter investigates {{the effect of the}} legal enforcement on the use of income increasing earnings management (EAR) and downward expectation management (EXP) to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts. Using a sample of 4, 934 firms from fourteen European countries, we document that the strength of the legal enforcement is negatively associated with EAR and positively associated with EXP. We provide evidence of a substitution effect between EAR and EXP only in the presence of strong legal enforcement, while they are complements when the legal enforcement is weak. We show that the capital market rewards meeting/beating firms, but it penalizes the concurrent use of EAR and EXP and this penalty is positively associated with the strength of the legal enforcement only for EAR. Our results show that legal enforcement has {{a significant role in the}} choice between EAR and EXP and that a change in the strength of legal enforcement drives how firms operate to meet or beat analyst forecasts. The contribution of this chapter is two-fold. This is the first study that examines how cross-country variation in the level of enforcement affects the interaction between EAR and EXP to meet/beat analyst forecasts. Second, this chapter is the first study that explores whether the capital market’s reaction to an earnings surprise is related to the strength of the legal enforcement. The second chapter examines how firm-level governance and country-level enforcement interplay in affecting IFRS mandatory adoption consequences on financial reporting quality. We operationalize financial reporting quality using earnings informativeness, accruals management, and real earnings management. We use a treatment sample of 3, 476 firm-year observations from 14 European countries that mandatorily adopt IFRS in 2005 and 29, 596 firm-year observations from 11 non-IFRS adoption countries. To account for the confounding effects of general trends in financial reporting quality or concurrent events unrelated to IFRS adoption, we estimate annual panel regressions for IFRS adopter firms and non-IFRS adopter firms using industry-country and separate year fixed effects for the treatment and control sample. Three key findings emerge from our analyses. First, IFRS adoption is, on average, associated with an increase in financial reporting quality. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in financial reporting quality changes, suggesting that IFRS mandatory adoption is not sufficient, per se, to change firms’ reporting practices. Second, in countries characterized by weak enforcement, strong board-level monitoring appears to enhance financial reporting quality, thus suggesting a substitutive effect between firm- and country-level governance. Third, in countries characterized by strong enforcement, firms with strong board-level monitoring exhibit a higher level of financial reporting quality than firms with weak board-level monitoring, thus suggesting that country- and firm-level governance are complementary. The chapter contributes to the literature in two ways. First, this is the first study that examines whether board-based monitoring mechanisms shape IFRS mandatory adoption consequences on financial reporting quality. Second, the chapter contributes to the growing literature on the interplay between firm-level governance and country institutional characteristics. The findings point toward a substitution effects between firm-level monitoring mechanisms and country-level enforcement mechanisms when the legal system is lax, while board monitoring and legal enforcement complement each other when the legal system gets stricter. The third chapter examines whether informational environment benefits following cross-listing in the U. S. vanish when the financial reporting process suffers by internal control deficiencies according to the Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX, hereafter). Previous literature documents an increase in the quality of the firm information environment following cross-listing in the U. S. and motivates this result with the bonding effect. This study disputes the idea that the cross-listing per se enhances the quality of firms’ information environment. We challenge this idea considering whether the quality of the information environment for cross-listed firms depends on an effective commitment to achieve higher levels of corporate transparency. As research setting, we use Section 302 of the SOX that requires to disclose any discovered internal control deficiency on internal controls over financial reporting. To account for the impact of general trends or concurrent events unrelated to SOX 302 disclosures on information environment of cross-listed firms, we employ as benchmark group all firms listed in their home market but not in the U. S. In addition, we employ propensity-score matching models to take into account differences in firm-characteristics between cross-listed and non-cross-listed firms while estimating SOX 302 disclosure treatment effect. Our analyses encompasses both changes and cross-sectional association tests. We show that cross-listed firms <b>disclosing</b> internal control <b>deficiencies</b> do not have a better information environment than their home-country peers, but only after the first disclosure on internal control deficiencies according to SOX 302. Second, we show that cross-listed firms experience an improvement in the information environment if they remediate to previously <b>disclosed</b> internal control <b>deficiencies.</b> Finally, we show that these results hold only for firms domiciled in countries with weak legal institutions, while cross-listed firms from countries with strong legal institutions do not experience a significant change in the quality of the information environment once they became cross-listed, irrespective from the disclosure of an internal control deficiency. The study contributes to the literature on cross-listing in two ways. First, we show the existence of substantial heterogeneity in cross-listing effects on firm information environment, driven by the adoption of adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Second, we add to the literature on the effects of the SOX. Literature shows that cross-listed firms experience a decrease in the level of opaqueness after the adoption of the SOX. We add to this literature the evidence that the decline in the level of opaqueness depends on cross-sectional differences in corporate transparency and hence it is not homogenous across all firms. ...|$|R

Postpartum haemorrhage is the dominant cause of death. Jaundice of unknown etiology and obstructed labour with uterine rupture are also common. The obstetric network in Luanda involves a system of referrals of emergencies from 10 peripheral birth units to two central hospitals. Objectives: The aim of these studies is to analyze part of the mortality, partially to elucidate the prevailing pathology and partially to develop safer routines in obstetric care with the focus on avoiding and treating complications and in referral of obstetric emergencies. We wanted to test a new disposable device, UnijectTM for routine administration of oxytocin as part of active management of the third stage of labour to reduce post partum bleeding. We wanted to understand the etiology of jaundice among pregnant women and by clinical audit assess the quality of care by studying the "avoidability" of uterine ruptures and time delay and partograph quality in the referral situation. Methods: In a comparative prospective study we compared post partum, blood loss of 782 women with expectative management to 814 women with active management of the third stage of labour (AMTL), while evaluating the effect of UnijectTM. A prospective case-control design was used to study jaundice etiology and its clinical consequences. Twenty pregnant women were compared to 40 controls regarding malaria, HIV, hepatitis A, B, C, E, maternal and neonatal outcome. During two periods, women referred from three peripheral units were studied regarding travelling time and waiting time to see a midwife and to see a doctor, partograph quality, clinical outcome and accordance of diagnosis at the two levels. Results: AMTL reduced postpartum blood loss by almost 50 % and women with a severe blood loss of > 1000 nil were reduced by 80 %. UnijectTM was well tolerated. Malaria and hepatic E were the most common causes found among the pregnant women with jaundice in the study and differed significantly from controls. Around 2 / 3 of uterine ruptures were judged to be avoidable at the hospital level. All parameters studied in the referral system showed a dramatic improvement in the second period compared to the first. Conclusions: AMTL should be introduced as clinical routine. UnijectTM can be recommended of logistic and epidemiologic reasons. To minimize the risk for jaundice among pregnant women, malaria prophylaxis has to be implemented as routine among pregnant women. Hepatitis E reflects the basic sanitary conditions, which need to be improved with the emphasis on clean water, separated from sewage. The conclusion regarding avoidability yield information for future education and improvements regarding the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>disclosed.</b> The dramatic improvement in the referral study shows how audit as a mean of studying current practices can lead to better quality of care...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. This topic has been widely addressed by the researches in the United States of America (US) after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act due to the increase of responsibilities on these controls. Italy has followed the US regulation with the law number 262 of 2005 and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have become of {{the interest of the}} regulators and of the companies that have to implement their evaluation. The thesis aims to analyze the effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The effectiveness can be analyzed looking at the output of the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting evaluation or looking at the procedures used in this evaluation. The outputs of the evaluation are the Internal Control <b>Deficiencies</b> found and <b>disclosed</b> to the market by the responsible for Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that usually is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Literature based on Sarbanes-Oxley Act usually uses this approach because in US is possible to have public data on Internal Control <b>Deficiencies</b> <b>disclosed</b> to the market. In Italy this kind of disclosure is limited, thus one part of the thesis analyzes the Internal Control Deficiencies found by the companies but not disclosed to the market because under the materiality level. The thesis looks at the Internal Auditor Detection Process to understand where are the problems that bring to more severe and persistent Internal Control Deficiencies and look for the type of Internal Control Deficiencies more severe and persistent. The idea under this research is to find the more problematic issues where the companies have to focus to increase the effectiveness of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Because of this difficulty in data availability for Internal Control Deficiencies, the effectiveness have been analyzed looking at the procedures used to evaluate the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The procedures have been analyzed looking at the quality of each phase of the audit cycle. The Internal Controls over Financial Reporting have been divided in its components of Entity Level Controls, Account-specific Controls and Information Technology Controls. Information Technology Controls Quality has been then related to audit risk and audit fees to see the relation between internal controls and external controls performed by external auditors. The idea under this research is that if the internal controls are effective and assure a higher reliability of financial reporting, the external auditors can reduce their work. Finally Information Technology Controls have been deeply investigates in their relevant component of outsourced controls. Based on specific frameworks, one part of the thesis address the Audit Quality of Outsourced Information Technology Controls, that is of significant interest nowadays. The idea under this research is that the evaluation of these controls without going directly in the outsourcers’ location is not enough to assure the effectiveness and the reliability of financial reporting that use the information technology controlled. Even if the standards let to use indirect evaluation or service auditors’ attestations, the thesis proposes to use the direct evaluation for a better effectiveness. Thus, the thesis is structured in three studies: 1. 	Audit Quality of Outsourced Information Technology Controls. 2. 	Information Technology Controls Quality and Audit Fees: Evidence from Italy. 3. 	Internal Auditor Detection Process and Internal Control Deficiencies Types. The order of the presentation follows the advancement of the paper for the publication...|$|R
