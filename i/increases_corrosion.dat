50|$|After the Washington Post ran front-page {{stories in}} January 2004 about the problem, a Congressional hearing {{was held in}} March 2004 where Edwards testified. At the hearing, Edwards {{identified}} {{the cause of the}} readings as chloramine, a disinfecting chemical that had replaced chlorine in the water supply in March 2000. Chloramine-treated water, he said, picks up lead from pipes and solder and does not release it, resulting in elevated levels. Chloramine also doesn't break down over time, as chlorine does, so there is always some in the water system. Edwards also testified that WASA's attempts to replace lead pipes with copper pipes could exacerbate the problem, because the copper <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> of the old lead.|$|E

50|$|Both uranium and {{plutonium}} {{are very}} susceptible to corrosion. A {{number of the}} problem-plagued W47 UGM-27 Polaris warheads had to be replaced after corrosion of the fissile material was discovered during routine maintenance. The W58 pits also suffered corrosion problems. The W45 pit was prone to corrosion that could alter its geometry. The Green Grass pit was also corrosion-prone. The radioactivity of the materials used can also cause radiation corrosion in the surrounding materials. Plutonium is highly susceptible to humidity; moist air <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> rate about 200 times. Hydrogen has strong catalytic effect on corrosion; its presence can accelerate corrosion rate by 13 orders of magnitude. Hydrogen can be generated from moisture and nearby organic materials (e.g. plastics) by radiolysis. These factors cause issues with storage of plutonium. The volume increase during oxidation can cause rupture of storage containers or deformation of pits.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to study the effect of carbonation on mechanical properties and durability of concrete. Ordinary portland concretes (OPC) with water/cement ratios of 0. 58 and 0. 48 and self-compacting concretes (SCC) with water/binder ratios of 0. 40 and 0. 36 were used in this study. Compressive strength test, splitting strength test, electrical resistivity test, rapid chloride penetration test (RCPT), open circuit potential method and alternative current (AC) impedance method were performed to estimate the properties of concrete. Test results showed that carbonation may compensate some concrete properties such as compressive strength, splitting strength, electrical resistivity and chloride ion penetration. However, corrosion test results showed that carbonation <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> rate of reinforcing steel...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} good {{corrosion}} resistance, copper and copper alloys such as 90 : 10 Cu-Ni are used extensively in high-quality marine and industrial piping systems {{and also in}} marine, urban, and industrial environments. Their corrosion loss and pitting behaviour tends to follow a bi-modal trend rather than the classic power law. Field data for 90 : 10 copper nickel immersed in natural seawater are used to explore the effect of water pollution {{and in particular the}} availability of critical nutrients for microbiologically induced corrosion. It is shown, qualitatively, that increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> predominantly in the second, long-term, mode of the model.

30|$|The erosion {{corrosion}} mechanism <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{reaction rate}} by continuously removing the passive layer of corrosion {{products from the}} wall of the pipe. The passive layer is a thin film of corrosion product that actually serves to stabilize the corrosion reaction and slow it down. As a result of the turbulence and high shear stress in the line, this passive layer can be removed, causing the corrosion rate to increase [33]. The erosion corrosion is always experienced where there is high turbulence flow regime with significantly higher rate of corrosion [34] and is dependent on fluid flow rate and the density and morphology of solids present in the fluid [20]. High velocities and presence of abrasive suspended material and the corrodents in drilling and produced fluids contribute to this destructive process. This form of corrosion is often overlooked or recognized as being caused by wear [35].|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} anodic {{oxidation}} of a NiTi {{shape memory alloy}} in sulfuric acid electrolyte on its surface characteristics was studied. Surface roughness was measured by roughness tester. Surface morphology was studied using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Corrosion behavior was specified by recording Potentiodynamic polarization curves and measuring the content of Ni ions, released into a SBF solution using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Fourier transformation infrared radiation (FT-IR) and energy dispersive spectroscopy were employed to verify the biocompatibility of the anodized and bare alloys after submersion in SBF. It was shown that anodic oxidation in sulfuric acid significantly <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance and biocompatibility. This layer improves corrosion resistance and Ni ion-release resistance by impeding the direct contact of the alloy with the corrosion mediums i. e. Ringer and SBF solutions.

30|$|With the concentration, {{temperature}} {{also affects}} the percentage inhibition efficiency (η%). It {{can be seen}} in Fig.  1 b that η% decreases with rise in temperatures (from 303 to 333  K), indicating an <b>increase</b> in <b>corrosion</b> rate. The <b>increase</b> in <b>corrosion</b> rate may be due to an appreciable decrease in the adsorption of the inhibitor molecules on the AA surface with increase in temperature [20]. With decrease in adsorption, more desorption of inhibitor molecules occurs because these two opposite processes are in equilibrium. Due to more desorption of inhibitor molecules at higher temperatures, the larger surface area of AA is affected in the alkaline environment, resulting in <b>increased</b> <b>corrosion</b> rates and decreased η% with the increase in temperature.|$|R
