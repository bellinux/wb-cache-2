5|$|The precise {{relationships}} between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur relationships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> included limited data and were highly contradictory. However, newer studies using larger data sets {{are beginning to}} make things clearer. The cladogram (family tree) below follows a phylogenetic analysis presented by Andres & Myers in 2013.|$|E
5|$|There exist four {{different}} types of supporters of Barcelona; one is the soci or club-member, who is eligible {{to vote in the}} presidential election of the club and other matters. The penyes, who are closely affiliated with the socis, are fan-clubs, which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> been responsible for large donations to the club. Also, there are Barça Fans and this term refers to the official online fan community of the club where these registered fans participate in games and other activities. Lastly there are the ordinary fans of the club, the cules, who do not possess any formal membership.|$|E
5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required {{for it to be}} successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training.|$|E

5|$|Zino's petrel nests in burrows {{which are}} visited only at night, to {{the accompaniment of}} their {{haunting}} calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E

25|$|Commenting on {{the issue}} on Guy A. Lepage's talk show, former PQ Premier Jacques Parizeau {{estimated}} that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion, adding that Hydro-Québec is often seen by Quebecers as a national success story {{and a source of}} pride. This could explain why various privatization proposals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> received little public attention. The liberal government has repeatedly stated that Hydro-Québec is not for sale.|$|E

The ford is more widely known in English as Jacob's Ford. The bridges built here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> led to its Arabic name, Jisr Benat Yakub, lit.

25|$|Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she {{is another}} example of social {{mobility}} in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev's chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, making big scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy's impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> had the freedom to dress like a lady and flirt with the manservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he has picked up in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Because {{psychogenic}} amnesia {{is defined by}} its lack of physical damage to the brain, treatment by physical methods is difficult. Nonetheless, distinguishing between organic and dissociative memory loss {{has been described as}} an essential first-step in effective treatments. Treatments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> attempted to alleve {{psychogenic amnesia}} by treating the mind itself, as guided by theories which range from notions such as 'betrayal theory' to account for memory loss attributed to protracted abuse by caregivers to the amnesia as a form of self-punishment in a Freudian sense, with the obliteration of personal identity as an alternative to suicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} early {{computer-controlled}} sequencers such as Cakewalk (sequencer) {{has led to}} the design of native Digital Audio Workstation or DAW platforms. Native DAW platforms such as Performer and more recent Digital Performer by Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU), Steinberg's Cubase and Nuendo, Apple's Logic Pro and Cakewalk's Sonar now have significant market share as well as professional studio users, though the most broadly accepted system is currently Avid's Pro Tools. They are particularly popular with home recording enthusiasts and artists making demos that might <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> required expensive studio time. Furthermore, mixes can be achieved using a computer only, otherwise known as in the box.|$|E

25|$|At {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the main campus, in Highfields Park, lies the Lakeside Arts Centre, the university's public arts facility and performance space. The D.H. Lawrence Pavilion houses a range of cultural facilities, including a 225 capacity theatre space, a series of craft cabinets, the Weston Gallery (which displays the university's manuscript collection), the Wallner gallery, which exists as a platform for local and regional artists, {{and a series of}} visual arts, performance and hospitality spaces. Other nearby facilities include the Djanogly Art Gallery, recital hall, and theatre, which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> hosted recordings and broadcasting by BBC Radio 3, the NOTT Dance and NOW festivals, and a series of contemporary art exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} erosive {{effects of}} acid reflux (an extremely common condition, {{also known as}} gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked {{to this type of}} cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, maybe due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett's esophagus is unclear, and may <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>have</b> been overestimated.|$|E
25|$|One {{initiative}} of the organization was the Ashcroft Manor Ranch Mega-Landfill Proposal in Ashcroft, British Columbia, in the Thompson Country of the British Columbia Interior, {{as there is no}} more room in the Lower Mainland for Metro Vancouver's garbage. A similar project nearby adjacent to the town of Cache Creek, British Columbia has almost reached capacity. Environmental concerns about the area's sensitive shrub-steppe climate and ecology are strong, while Highland Valley Copper, near Logan Lake, has offered the use of its mine-pit instead.
