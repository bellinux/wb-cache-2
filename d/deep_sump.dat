5000|$|The 301.6 (4.9L) GMC inline six was {{produced}} from 1952 to 1960, {{when it was}} replaced by the V6. It has a 4.00" [...] bore and a 4.00" [...] stroke. This is the largest raised-deck engine. It was originally designed for the GMC military M135 and M211. It was used in military 2.5 ton trucks with the HydraMatic transmission; however, the engine was a sealed engine for snorkel/submersion use, had an electric fuel pump, and other features such as a <b>deep</b> <b>sump</b> oil pan. From 1952 to 1959, GMC manufactured the civilian 302 engine, which was not sealed, had a mechanical fuel pump, and used a [...] "standard" [...] oil pan. This engine was popular with hotrod enthusiasts because it delivered tremendous power for an inline six engine at the time (although now obsolete), is truck built with a heavy cast block, and can take quite a bit of abuse.|$|E
50|$|As speeds increased, the {{high-speed}} engine evolved towards its developed {{form of the}} multi-cylinder vertical engine with an enclosed crankcase. There was also a tendency to use single-acting pistons. This had two advantages, the lubrication {{could be provided by}} a generous 'splash' system within the crankcase that also helped with cooling, and secondly that the forces in a single-acting engine always act in the same way, as a compression force along the piston rod and connecting rod. This meant that even if a bearing's clearances were relatively slack, the bearing was always held tight. Slack, and thus free-running, bearings could be accepted. An example of such an engine would be the twin-cylinder Westinghouse engines. These engines used a trunk piston, as used for internal combustion engines today, where there is no separate crosshead and the gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is moved up within the piston itself. This provides a very compact layout, but obviously requires a single-acting piston. Interestingly, the main crankshaft bearings of this engine were provided with separate oilers that drained into the crankcase sump. It was recognised that the crankcase oil would become contaminated with water from condensed steam and blow-by from the pistons. A valve was provided for draining this collected condensate off from beneath the oil {{in the bottom of the}} <b>deep</b> <b>sump.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the balance}} chain would stretch, {{resulting}} with the counterweights {{being out of}} phase and making the engine run rough. Although Yamaha quickly repaired the problems, including a <b>deeper</b> <b>sump</b> and an adjustable balance chain, sales fell and the TX750 became synonymous with poor design and reliability. The 1974 Model was extensively modified with a revised sump and does not suffer from reliability issues.|$|R

5000|$|These are the {{two most}} {{remarkable}} buildings in the Home Farm complex and are listed Grade II* They are at the N W side of the farm and were built around 1855. The buildings consist of 2 circular sheds both of which are open in the centre; the W shed was a sheep house, the E shed was a piggery. These are joined by a long link range which housed sheep on the N side, facing the fields, and probably cattle on the S side facing the 2 stockyards. The sheep house and piggery has louvres in the vent ridges of the roof. Its inner wall has drains at the internal floor level above a <b>deep</b> <b>sump</b> in which there are 8 radiating tunnels with round-headed openings. The slurry from the animals would drain in to the circular sumps, before being piped away for use as manure to fertilise the estate fields. The timber framing used to construct the very complex structure of the ridge of the circular buildings is remarkable. The roofs drain water both outwards and inwards, into the circular sump. It has been suggested that these circular buildings were developed from similar farm building on model farms in the U.S.A. , but Wilian illustrates another circular cowhouse at Cae’r lan, Abercraf, Breconshire. This lacks the central sump, but is of the same date ...|$|E
40|$|Gas turbine aero-engines employ fast {{rotating}} shafts {{that are}} supported by bearings at several axial locations along the engine. Due to extreme load and heat, oil is injected to the bearings to aid lubrication and cooling. The oil is then shed to the bearing chamber before it is extracted out by a scavenge pump. Scavenging oil from the bearing chamber is challenging due to high windage induced by the fast rotating shafts {{as well as the}} two-phase nature of the flow. A <b>deep</b> <b>sump</b> has been found to increase scavenge performance due to its ability to shelter the pooled oil from the bulk rotating air flow thus minimizing two-phase mixing. However in many cases, a <b>deep</b> <b>sump</b> is not an option due to conflicting space requirements. The space limitation becomes more stringent with higher bypass ratio engines as the core becomes smaller. Therefore it is imperative to have a high performing shallow sump. However shape modification of a shallow sump is too constrained due to limited space and therefore has minimal impact on the scavenge performance. This research presents several alternative concepts to improve scavenge performance of a generic baseline shallow sump by augmenting it with attachments or inserts. These augmentations attempt to exploit two known mechanisms for reducing the residence volume: momentum reduction and sheltering. The experimental results show that some augmentations are able to reduce the residence volume of a shallow sump by up to 50 % or more in some cases...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{removal from}} {{aeroengine}} bearing chambers presents {{a challenge for}} aeroengine designers. Effective scavenging of oil is necessary to avoid excessive heat in the bearing chamber as this may lead to degradation of oil properties and deterioration in heat transfer functionality. However the task of oil removal is not trivial. Oil is entrained in a highly rotating environment induced by rotating shafts. An aeroengine scavenge pump must remove both air and oil from the chamber and {{the ratio of the}} two fluids depends on pump operating point as well as the geometry of the exit region. The University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems is conducting an on-going experimental programme investigating liquid and gas flow behaviour in a relevant highly rotating environment. Previously reported work [2, 4] in combination with work conducted by Purdue University [3, 5] suggests that a deeper sump may help to reduce residence volume. More recently a study has been conducted that investigates geometries incorporating features sometimes included in aeroengine scavenge. Three very different exit geometries were investigated experimentally using chamber residence volume as a parameter of comparison. Data for one of these, the so called Curved Wall <b>Deep</b> <b>Sump</b> (CWDS), has already been reported in [4]. This paper presents residence volume data for all three sumps over a range of shaft speeds, inlet flow rates and scavenge ratios. Trends are analysed and presented and areas for future work identified. Copyright © 2013 by Rolls-Royce pl...|$|E

The SAFL Baffle is a stormwater treatment device created at the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Previous research by Howard et al. 2011 showed {{that when the}} SAFL Baffle is retrofitted into a sump manhole, it improves {{the ability of the}} sump to collect sediment at low flow rates and retain captured sediment at high flow rates. The purpose of this research was to know how a SAFL Baffle performs when: 1. Clogged with debris like trash and vegetation 2. Installed in a sump manhole with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the inlet pipe 3. Installed in a sump manhole with water entering through an inlet grate and inlet pipe Tests were performed at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 6 -ft (1. 8 m) <b>deep</b> <b>sump,</b> a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 3 -ft (0. 9 m) <b>deep</b> <b>sump,</b> a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 1 -ft (0. 3 m) deep scale model sump, and a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 0. 5 -ft (0. 15 m) deep scale model sump. All of the sumps were equipped with the SAFL Baffle, and were evaluated using two metrics: 1. How well the system captures sediment at low flow rates (Removal Efficiency Testing) 2. How well the system retains the previously captured sediment at high flow rates (Washout Testing) When a SAFL Baffle was clogged with stormwater debris, water traveled underneath of the SAFL Baffle. If the sump was deep, performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle did not change significantly. However, if the sump was shallow, significant washout was exhibited in the sump. This washout problem in shallow sumps was mitigated when a SAFL Baffle with hole diameters equal to 5 -in (12. 7 cm) was installed in the sump. Sumps with outlet pipes located 90 degrees to the inlet pipe exhibited significant washout of previously captured sediment during high flow rates. With a SAFL Baffle installed at an angle between 90 - 120 degrees of the inlet pipe, washout sharply decreased. At low flow rates, a SAFL Baffle installed at a 113 degree angle with respect to the inlet pipe captured more sediment than a SAFL Baffle installed in a standard, straight flow-through sump. In the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle that received water from an inlet pipe and an inlet grate from above, washout rates were highest when the flow rate from the inlet pipe was less than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Similarly, the ability of the device to capture sediment decreased when the flow rate from the inlet pipe was less than three times greater than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Through extensive testing, it was determined that the standard sumps equipped with the SAFL Baffle should be used downstream of stormwater sewers such that the drainage basin of the inlet pipe is at least three times the drainage basin of the inlet grate. Under this condition, the flow from an inlet grate from above does not impact the performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle...|$|E

40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil collected via the sump and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil collects at the sump and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with <b>deep</b> <b>sumps</b> perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|R

40|$|Although Twin Roll Casting (TRC) {{process has}} been used for almost 60 years in the {{aluminum}} industry, TRC of magnesium is relatively new. In TRC, molten metal is fed onto water-cooled rolls, where it solidifies and is then rolled. Solidification of the molten metal starts at the point of first metal-roll contact and is completed before the kissing point (point of least roll separation) of the two rolls. The unique thermo-physical properties inherent to magnesium and its alloys, such as lower specific heat and latent heat of fusion and larger freezing ranges (in comparison with aluminum and steel) make it challenging for TRC of this alloy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the process and the interaction between the casting conditions and strip final quality is imperative to guarantee high quality twin roll cast strip production. A powerful tool to achieve such knowledge is to develop a mathematical model of the process. In this thesis, a 2 D mathematical model for TRC of AZ 31 magnesium alloy has been developed and validated based on the TRC facility located at the Natural Resources Canada Government Materials Laboratory (CanmetMATERIALS) in Hamilton, ON, Canada. The validation was performed by comparing the predicted exit strip temperature and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) through the strip thickness with those measured and obtained by experiments. The model was developed in two stages, first a thermal-fluid model was developed followed by validation and then a thermal-fluid-stress model was developed. This is the first time a comprehensive thermal-fluid-stress model has been developed to simulate the TRC process for magnesium alloys. The work has led to new knowledge about the TRC process and its effects on magnesium strip quality including the following: 1) 	Using ALSIM and ANSYS® CFX® commercial packages a 2 D mathematical model of thermal-fluid-stress behavior of the magnesium sheet during TRC was successfully developed and validated. 2) 	An average value of 11 kW/m 2 °C for the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) was found to best represent the heat transfer between the roll and the strip during TRC casting of AZ 31 using the CanmetMATERIALS facility. 3) 	Modeling results showed that increasing casting speed, casting thicker strips and applying higher HTCs led to less uniform microstructure through thickness in terms of SDAS. 4) 	Simulations showed the importance of casting parameters such as casting speed and set-back distance on the thermal history and stress development in the sheet during TRC; higher casting speeds led to <b>deeper</b> <b>sumps</b> and higher exit temperatures as well as lower overall rolling loads and lower total strains experienced during TRC. 5) 	The effect of roll diameter on the thermal history and stress development in the strip was also studied and indicated how larger roll diameters increased the surface normal stress and rolling loads but had little effect on the mushy zone thickness. 6) 	The correlation between the mechanisms of center-line and inverse segregation formation and thermo-mechanical behavior of the strip was performed. The modeling results suggested that increasing the set-back distance decreases the risk of both defects. Moreover, increasing the roll diameter reduces the propensity to inverse segregation but has a minor effect for center-line segregation formation...|$|R
