60|$|<b>HAWFINCH</b> (Coccothraustes vulgaris).--Sometimes seen, but not common.|$|E
60|$|Here {{then are}} 26 highly vocal species, {{of which the}} songs, calls, chirps, and various other notes, are {{distinctly}} remembered in 23. Of the other three one was silent--a small rare migratory finch resembling the bearded-tit in its reed-loving habits, its long tail and slender shape, and partly too in its colouring. I listened in vain for this bird's singing notes. Of the remaining two one is a finch, the other a troupial; the first a pretty bird, in appearance a small <b>hawfinch</b> with its whole plumage a lovely glaucous blue; a poor singer with a low rambling song: the second a bird {{of the size of}} a starling, coloured like a golden oriole, but more brilliant; and this one has a short impetuous song composed of mixed guttural and clear notes.|$|E
60|$|The most {{curious fact}} is the perfect {{gradation}} {{in the size of}} the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a <b>hawfinch</b> to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown in (Plate 81) Figure 1, and the smallest in Figure 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Figure 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Figure 4. The beak of Cactornis is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth sub-group, Camarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird, originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.|$|E

50|$|In Devon (Southwest England), <b>hawfinch</b> {{is largely}} {{confined}} to the upper Teign Valley. In Western England and Wales, two areas in which <b>hawfinch</b> reliably occurs are the Forest of Dean and the Wyre Forest. In Eastern England <b>hawfinch</b> {{is present in the}} Breckland of East Anglia. In Northern England, hawfinches are regularly found in a small number of locations in northern England. Prime sites include Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire and Hulne Park in Northumberland.Hawfinches can be seen at Cromford Derbyshire near the canal and at Clumber Park (Nottinghamshire) near the chapel. In Scotland, Scone Palace near Perth is the most well-known site in Scotland for <b>hawfinch.</b> Formerly, they also occurred in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.|$|E
50|$|Bengtesgård meadow (Bengtesgårds äng) is {{a nature}} reserve in Falkenberg Municipality, Sweden. It has {{an area of}} 4.4 ha and has been {{protected}} since 1972. <b>Hawfinches</b> nest {{in the area and}} another red-listed species, Grifola frondosa, {{can be found on the}} ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hawfinches</b> first breed {{when they}} are one year old. They are monogamous with a pair-bond that {{sometimes}} persists {{from one year to}} the next. Pair-formation takes place before the breakup of the wintering flocks. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Britain most clutches are laid between late April and late June.|$|R
5000|$|The site is in two {{separate}} areas. The Roman River, after which the site is named, runs along the southern boundary of both of them. There are areas of woodland, grassland, fen, scrub and heath. The woodland it mainly ancient, {{and there are more}} than a thousand species of moths and butterflies, and nearly seventy of breeding birds, including <b>hawfinches,</b> tree pipits and yellow wagtails.|$|R
50|$|The Hawker <b>Hawfinch</b> fighter {{aircraft}} was designed in 1925 {{as a replacement}} for both the Armstrong-Whitworth Siskin and the Gloster Gamecock fighters. It participated in the competition to meet Specification F9/26, together with other aircraft manufacturers, that included nine different designs, of which five were built. The <b>Hawfinch</b> first flew in March 1927. The Bristol Bulldog and the <b>Hawfinch</b> were considered to be the best of the aircraft evaluated, and were selected for more detailed evaluation. The contract was finally awarded to the Bristol Bulldog, because of its slightly higher maximum speed as well as being easier to maintain. After the completion of the competition, the prototype <b>Hawfinch</b> was used for experimental purposes, being tested with single-bay wings and with a twin-float undercarriage.|$|E

50|$|The site is on glacial {{sand and}} gravel over London clay. it {{has a number of}} areas of oak and {{hornbeam}} woodland on former heathland. It also has two botanically rich valleys, each of which has a stream along it. Poors' Piece and Pheasanthouse Wood have ancient woodland. Uncommon ground plants are pill sedge, broad-leaved helleborine and lady-fern. There are common brimstone and speckled wood butterflies, nightingales, <b>hawfinches,</b> badgers. and dormice.|$|R
5000|$|The Forest of Dean {{is known}} for its birds; pied flycatchers, redstarts, wood warblers and <b>hawfinches</b> can be seen at RSPB Nagshead. The mixed forest {{supports}} Britain's best concentration [...] of goshawks and a viewing site at New Fancy is manned during February and March. Peregrine falcons {{can be seen from the}} viewpoint at Symonds Yat rock. Mandarin ducks, which nest in the trees, and Reed warblers can be seen at Cannop Ponds and Cannop Brook, running from the ponds through Parkend, is famed for its Dippers.|$|R
50|$|The soils on {{this site}} are glacial sands and gravels over London clay, {{resulting}} {{in a mixture of}} woodland, heath and bog habitats. Blake's Wood is ancient woodland on a sloping site, with valleys and streams. The main trees are oak, together with other species such as hornbeam and sweet chestnut. There is a wide variety of birds, such as <b>hawfinches</b> and nightingales, and the underlayer is dominated by bluebells and primroses. The heath is being invaded by trees and bracken. Acid grassland is dominated by red fescue, and there are two rare moths, Deltote bankiana and Elaphria venustula.|$|R

50|$|Southeast England is the {{stronghold of}} <b>hawfinch</b> in Britain. One {{well-known}} site is Bedgebury Pinetum, where flocks gather to roost in winter. The species {{is also found}} in the New Forest; a central roost site exists here, at the Blackwater Arboretum. The only Sussex stronghold is at Westdean Woods in West Sussex. While in Surrey they are regularly seen at Bookham Common in winter. Formerly <b>hawfinch</b> were regularly encountered in the Windsor Great Park area in winter though no sizeable gatherings have been reported since the mid-1990s. The recent (2007-11) BTO Bird Atlas shows no evidence of <b>hawfinch</b> breeding anywhere in this area, the reasons are unclear.|$|E

50|$|The seed cones are modified, each cone {{containing}} a single seed, which is 4 - 7 mm long, and partly {{surrounded by a}} fleshy scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril. The aril is 8 - 15 mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils mature 6 to 9 months after pollination, and with the seed contained, are eaten by thrushes, waxwings and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings. Maturation of the arils is spread over 2 to 3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The seeds themselves are poisonous and bitter, but are opened and eaten by some bird species including <b>hawfinches,</b> greenfinches and great tits. The aril is not poisonous, it is gelatinous and very sweet tasting. The male cones are globose, 3 - 6 mm diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. The yew is mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time.|$|R
40|$|PCR-based {{methods have}} been {{increasingly}} used in diagnosis of parasitic diseases. Over 40 morphospecies of avian malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium have been described. However, only nine {{of them have been}} identified on the level of their mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene lineages, which are frequently used in molecular biology studies of avian blood haemosporidian parasites. In this study, we linked two common mitochondrial cyt b lineages P-SGS 1 and P-TURDUS 1 with their morphospecies. Light infections with two species of malaria parasites of the subgenera Haemamoeba and Giovannolaia were isolated from naturally infected adult <b>Hawfinches,</b> Coccothraustes coccothraustes Linnaeus, on the Curonian Spit in the Baltic Sea. These parasites were inoculated to naive juveniles of the Common Crossbill, Loxia curvirostra Linnaeus, and House Sparrow, Passer domesticus Linnaeus. Heavy parasitemia of Plasmodium (Haemamoeba) relictum Grassi & Feletti, 1891 (lineage P-SGS 1) and Plasmodium (Giovannolaia) circumflexum Kikuth, 1931 (P-TURDUS 1) developed in the subinoculated Common Crossbills and House Sparrows, respectively, which enabled the detailed illustration of all main blood stages of these parasites and the deposition of their voucher specimens. The parasites of both lineages are actively transmitted in Europe and inhabit a broad range of avian hosts. Lineages closely related to P. relictum and P. circumflexum were identified. This study contributes to establishing of combined PCR-based and morphological identification of avian malaria parasites...|$|R
60|$|Further east in China it {{is still}} more {{difficult}} to determine {{the limits of the}} region, owing to the great intermixture of migrating birds; tropical forms passing northwards in summer as far as the Amoor river, while the northern forms visit every part of China in winter. From what we know, however, of the distribution of some of the more typical northern and southern species, we are able to fix the limits of the Palæarctic region a little south of Shanghai on the east coast. Several tropical genera come as far north as Ningpo or even Shanghai, but rarely beyond; while in Formosa and Amoy tropical forms predominate. Such decidedly northern forms as bullfinches and <b>hawfinches</b> are found at Shanghai; hence we may commence the boundary line on the coast between Shanghai and Ningpo, but inland it probably bends a little southward, and then northward to the mountains and valleys of West {41} China and East Thibet in about 32° N. latitude; where, at Moupin, a French missionary, Père David, made extensive collections showing this district to be at the junction of the tropical and temperate faunas. Japan, as a whole, is decidedly Palæarctic, although its extreme southern portion, owing to its mild insular climate and evergreen vegetation, gives shelter to a number of tropical forms.|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 4 November 1998, {{the next}} {{installment}} focuses on dietary needs and how different species have evolved beaks {{to suit their}} individual requirements. The latter come in a multitude of forms. Blue tits and goldfinches have beaks akin to tweezers, with which to extract seeds, while the <b>hawfinch's</b> razor-like bill can deal with a cherry-stone. However, the crossbill is the only finch that can twist its mandibles in opposite directions. Jays store acorns for winter by burying them in the ground, whereas woodpeckers can keep up to 60,000 of them in one tree trunk. Sap is also desirable, {{and there are a}} variety of methods used to obtain it. The hoatzin is the only specialised leaf-eater, and accordingly has a digestive system more akin to that of cattle. Plants recruit birds to aid pollination, and offer nectar as a reward. hummingbirds eat little else, and the sword-bill's beak is the longest of any bird in relation to its body. Insects are also highly prized, and Galápagos finches are shown to possess some ingenuity as they not only strip bark, but also use 'tools' to reach their prey. Crows are hailed as being among the most intelligent birds, and one is shown using a twig to spear a grub within a fallen log. The robin is an opportunist, and Attenborough observes one seizing morsels as he digs a patch of earth. In South America, a cattle tyrant sits atop an obliging capybara and uses its vantage point to spot passing food that may be dislodged by its grazing partner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hawfinches</b> {{engage in}} an {{elaborate}} series of courtship routines. The two birds stand apart facing one another and reach out to touch their bills. The male displays to the female by standing erect, puffing out the feathers on his head, neck and chest and allowing his wings to droop forward. He then makes a deep bow. The male will also lower a wing and moves it in a semi-circular arc revealing his wing bars and modified wing feathers. The breeding pairs are usually solitary but they occasionally breed in loose groups. The nest is normally located high in a tree on a horizontal branch with easy access from the air. The male chooses {{the site of the}} nest and builds a layer of dry twigs. After a few days the female takes over. The nest is untidy and is formed of a bulky twig base and a shallow cup lined with roots, grasses and lichens. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals. The clutch is normally 4-5 eggs. There is considerable variable in the colour and shape of the eggs. They have purple brown and pale grey squiggles on a background that can be buff, grey-green or pale blueish. The average size is 24.1 x 17.5 mm with a calculated weight of 3.89 g. The eggs are incubated for 11-13 days by the female. The nestlings are fed by both parents who regurgitate seeds but also bring mouthfuls of caterpillars. Initially the male normally passes the food to the female who feeds the chicks but as they grow bigger both adults feed them directly. The female broods the chicks while they are in the nest. They fledge after 12-14 days and the young birds become independent of their parents around 30 days later. The parents generally only raise a single brood each year.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of the {{long-term}} investigation, carried out in the Russian Far East (Primorye and Khabarovsk Territories, Amur and Sakhalin regions), and published data about bird ecology, the actual material about the birds feeding seeds and berries of the Amur cork-tree, Phellodendron amurense Rupr. and Sakhalin cork-tree, Ph. sachalinensis (Fr. Schmidt) Sarg., is given in the article. It has been found 43 carpophagous bird species from 15 families and 5 orders. The cork-tree berries, small roundish juicy fruits with little stones, are eaten by the birds of 40 species from 13 families; basically by Grey-headed Woodpecker – Picus canus, Azure-winged Magpies – Cyanopica cyanus, Bohemian and Japanaese Waxwings – Bombycilla garrulus and B. japonica, Thrushes: Pale Thrush – Turdus pallidus, Eyebrowed Thrush – Turdus obscurus, Grey-backed Thrush – T. hortulorum, Naumann’s Thrush – T. naumanni, and Dusky Thrush – T. eunomus, Eurasian Nuthatch – Sitta europaea, Pallas’s Rose Finch – Carpodacus roseus. The secondary birds – 16 species. On the Sakhalin isl. the Sakhalin cork-tree, Ph. sachalinensis berries are eaten by the birds of 33 species from 12 families, on the South Kuriles (Kunashir isl.) – by the birds of 28 species from 11 families. On Sakhalin the berries are eaten basically by the Waxwings (2 species), Dusky and Brown-headed – Turdus chrysolaus – Thrushes, Eurasian Nuthatch, Pallas’s Rose Finch; and secondary birds – 12 species. There are 5 species of the primary birds and 8 species of the secondary birds on the Kunashir isl. A participation of the birds in the dissemination of the cork-tree, Phellodendron Rupr., during seasonal migrations in winter and autumn has been considered. The active birds in the seed distribution are Grey-headed Woodpecker, Azure-winged Magpies, Waxwings, Thrushes and others; while they are eating the berries, the seeds are not damaged in the gastrointestinal tract and pushed with the excrements outside. In addition, Eurasian Nuthatches and Tits actively distribute the seeds, making stocks under the tree bark and in the semihollows. The passive agents of dissemination are Hazel Grouse – Tetrastes bonasia, Common Pheasant – Phasianus colchicus, Great Spotted Woodpeckers – Dendrocopos major, Oriental Tutle Doves – Streptopelia orientalis, Pallas’s Rose Finches, <b>Hawfinches</b> – Coccothraustes coccothraustes and some others, who can crack hard seed peel by the peckers, but some part of the seed peels retain undamaged in the gastrointestinal tract and is pushed outside. The main role in the cork-tree dissemination belongs to the migrants and wintering birds – woodpeckers, azure-winged magpies, thrushes and waxwings, distributing seeds on the feeding places and transferring them on the different distances from the areas of the plant growing...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hawfinch</b> (Coccothraustes coccothraustes) {{has long}} been {{recognised}} as being closely related to other grosbeaks in the genera Mycerobas, Hesperiphona and Eophona. This was confirmed by molecular genetic studies that showed that the four genera form a well-defined clade. Some authorities have grouped all the species into a single large Coccothraustes genus but this is usually split.
