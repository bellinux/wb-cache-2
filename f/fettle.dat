[...] He had served a coaching function {{as far back as}} 1891, when The New York Times described his role as follows: [...] "Frank Morse, '95, coached the players in today's practice and found many points in the play to criticize." [...] The World of New York in 1896 said of Morse:"Coach Morse is a very wise young man. [...] In the first place he was perhaps the greatest half-back that Princeton ever turned out. [...] He was a star in the team of '93 which is known as the 'perfect team.' [...] This is his first year as a regular coach, and he is said {{to be one of the}} best that the New Jersey university has had."Coach Morse impressed reporters before his first Princeton-Yale game by asserting that his players were in fine physical condition [...] "after months of scientific training":"It is really refreshing to hear a man who knows his player perfectly say, on the eve of the great game of the year, that his men are in perfect <b>fettle.</b> [...] Moreover, he says frankly that the team is one of the best that Princeton has ever had, which is another violation of precedent." ...|$|E

40|$|Within the EU-project SPRINT 002 German, British and Danish {{research}} institutes {{and industrial}} companies have cooperated to realise a technical concept, which {{was focused on}} the application of an abrasive water jet as a <b>fettling</b> tool for a robot-guided casting. The German contribution to this project was the designing, building up and operating of Pilot Cell 2. The trails of this cell have revield the potential of this new <b>fettling</b> technique: good quality of the automated <b>fettled</b> castings with a <b>fettling</b> time of about 2 times faster than manual <b>fettling.</b> Furthermore, the developed recycling system has indicated the possibility to re-use the abrasives and water in the <b>fettling</b> process. It is now a task for foundry equipment suppliers, to take up this new <b>fettling</b> technique for a commercial utilization. (orig.)

50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{preparing}} the puddling furnace; this involves bringing the furnace {{to a low}} temperature and then <b>fettling</b> it. <b>Fettling</b> {{is the process of}} painting the grate and walls around it with iron oxides, typically hematite; this acts as a protective coating keeping the melted metal from burning through the furnace. Sometimes finely pounded cinder was used instead of hematite. In this case the furnace must be heated for 4-5 hours to melt the cinder and then cooled before charging.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fettling</b> can add {{significantly}} {{to the cost of}} the resulting product, and designers of molds seek to minimize it through the shape of the mold, the material being cast, and sometimes by including decorative elements.|$|R

40|$|Automation of <b>fettling</b> {{requires}} in {{most cases}} the compensation of tolerances. Tolerances of castings, which are too large to be compensated by passive compliance, must be compensated by means of sensory acquisition of deviations and adaptive control. A prototype robotic <b>fettling</b> cell using different sensor systems for this purpose is achieved at the IPK. In this prototype installation tolerances of the parts are measured before the cutting process, deviations of the burr positions and dimension are thus determined. According to the difference between the programmed and the real geometry the cutting trajectory is adapted. In addition to that signales from motor current sensors are used for feed speed control during the cutting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{mortality}} {{experienced by}} {{a cohort of}} 10, 491 United Kingdom steel foundry workers during the period 1946 - 85 has been investigated. These workers were all male operatives first employed {{in any one of}} the 10 participating foundries in 1946 - 65; all had worked in the industry for a minimum period of one year. Compared with the general population of England and Wales, statistically significant excesses relating to cancer mortality were found for cancer of the stomach (E = 77. 4, O = 106, SMR = 137) and cancer of the lung (E = 229. 2, O = 441, SMR = 147). A statistically significant deficit was found for cancer of the brain (E = 19. 4, O = 10, SMR = 51). Involvement of occupational exposures was assessed by the method of regression models and life tables (RMLT). This method was used to compare the duration of employment in the industry, in "dust exposed" jobs, in "fume exposed" jobs, in foundry area jobs, in <b>fettling</b> shop jobs, and in foundry area or <b>fettling</b> shop jobs, of those dying from cancers of the stomach and lung with those of all matching survivors. The RMLT analyses provided evidence of an occupational involvement in the risk of death from lung cancer from work in the foundry area or <b>fettling</b> shop, and weaker evidence of an occupational involvement in the risk of death from stomach cancer from work in the foundry area...|$|R
