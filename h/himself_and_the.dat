5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased {{back to the ship}} by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chief}} aide and closest friend of Emperor Andronikos III, Kantakouzenos became regent for the underage John V upon Andronikos's death in June 1341. While Kantakouzenos was absent from Constantinople in September the same year, a coup d'état led by Alexios Apokaukos and the Patriarch John XIV secured {{the support of}} Empress Anna and {{established}} a new regency. In response, Kantakouzenos' army and supporters proclaimed him co-emperor in October, cementing the rift between <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new regency. The split immediately escalated into armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} teach at the RAM, with which he was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conductor Michael Costa.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, {{rather than focusing on}} Flaubert's alone.|$|E
5|$|In the Mongol {{siege of}} Kaifeng from 1232 to 1233, the Mongol Empire {{captured}} Kaifeng, {{the capital of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Mongols and Jurchens had been at war for nearly two decades, beginning in 1211 after the Jurchens refused the Mongol offer to submit as a vassal. Ögedei Khan sent two armies to besiege Kaifeng, one led by <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other by his brother Tolui. Command of the forces, once they converged into a single army, was given to Subutai who led the siege. The Mongols arrived at the walls of Kaifeng on April8, 1232.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, Waylon Smithers {{finally comes}} out as gay {{to his boss}} Mr. Burns, who rejects his love. Other {{characters}} attempt to find a boyfriend for Smithers, and he falls for Julio. Meanwhile, Milhouse competes against a new boy for the lead role in a school production of Casablanca, so he can act alongside his own unrequited love, Lisa. Openly gay actor George Takei makes a cameo as <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> episode features a variety of cultural references, including to Grindr, Vladimir Putin, Equus and the films of Humphrey Bogart.|$|E
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2007 a {{petition}} to the Cardiff Civic Authorities was begun to bestow a fitting tribute upon both Keenor <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1927 FA Cup squad he so heroically captained. On 4 December 2009, the approaching road to Cardiff City Stadium was named Ffordd Fred Keenor (Fred Keenor Road).|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1952, the {{squadron}} {{was ordered to}} attack a convoy of Chinese vehicles. Overton, leading a group of 24 F-84s, directed attacks on the convoy despite taking intense anti-aircraft fire <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aircraft destroyed 150 vehicles. Though the circumstances in the event were lost in subsequent actions, Overton would later be decorated for this achievement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the film's release, July 12, 2013, another {{viral video}} was {{released}} to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro <b>himself)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> YouTube network Polaris (also known as The Game Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the Game Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film's Kaiju and Jaegers.|$|E

5|$|Sabuktigin died in 997, and was {{succeeded by}} his son Ismail as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud, who had more {{administrative}} experience than his brother, claimed the throne for <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following year managed to defeat his brother and gain control over the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud quickly began increasing his independence from the Samanids, and eventually divided the Samanid state with the Karakhanids, ending the Samanid dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|At Somnia, {{the hero}} meets Carver, which doesn't seem to {{remember}} the hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's military which gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen. Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, does see them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca's help.|$|E

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|Benton, Bauer and {{the boys}} are spotted by Iké's helicopter. While they flee into the forest, Benton steps on a land mine. With little time to disarm it, Benton urges Bauer to leave, so he can buy time. When he is {{surrounded}} by Iké and his men, Benton takes his foot off the trigger and detonates the mine, killing <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rebels, though Iké survives. Bauer and the children continue to the capital, where he defeats another rebel ambush. At {{the gates of the}} embassy, Trammel denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children's safety. He reluctantly accepts, thus sacrificing his freedom. While Taylor is inaugurated President, Bauer and the children evacuate, leaving chaotic Sangala behind.|$|E
5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E
