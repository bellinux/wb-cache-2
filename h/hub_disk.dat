50|$|The {{centrifugal}} design {{uses the}} centrifugal force {{generated by a}} rotating disk, with blades mounted {{at right angles to}} the disk, to impart movement to the air or gas and increase its pressure. The assembly of the <b>hub,</b> <b>disk</b> and blades is known as the fan wheel, and often includes other components with aerodynamic or structural functions. The centrifugal fan wheel is typically contained within a scroll-shaped fan housing, resembling the shell of the nautilus sea creature with a central hole. The air or gas inside the spinning fan is thrown off the outside of the wheel, to an outlet at the housing's largest diameter. This simultaneously draws more air or gas into the wheel through the central hole http://www.howden.com/en/Products/default.htm. Inlet and outlet ducting are often attached to the fan's housing, to supply and/or exhaust the air or gas to the industry's requirements.|$|E

A complex secondary air {{system has been}} designed in order to feed the cooled turbine. The rotor blade has been heavily instrumented at the platform, 7 % and 15 % of the blade height with fast response pressure sensors and double-layer thin film gauges, allowing a complete aero-thermal characterization of the flow field. The <b>hub</b> <b>disk</b> leakage and platform cooling blowing ratios have been varied independently {{in order to assess}} their impact individually. Furthermore, tests have been performed at two different rotational speeds. The <b>hub</b> <b>disk</b> leakage flow has a strong impact on the flow field, changing the degree of reaction and the stage velocity triangles. The stator-rotor interaction is particularly affected by the stator rim cavity flow both in terms of heat transfer and pressure fluctuations.

The study shows that wear particles are flying very close to the disk surface. They can deposit on the disk surface and cause damage to disk drives. Cooling air flow through the <b>disk</b> <b>hub</b> of corotating <b>disks</b> has been found to play important roles in removing wear particles from disk drives.

40|$|This {{document}} is final report of an expertise project lead for ALPHA Company. The project {{focuses on the}} machinability characterization and comparison of various lamellar cast irons metallurgies. The comparison is performed {{in order to improve}} the casting process and the cast irons composition of brake and <b>hub</b> <b>disk,</b> to increase their machinability. The characterization of the metallurgies was made by tool life test with measurements of the cutting forces. Hardness and surface roughness measurements were performed too. Several Silicon nitride tools were tested. First an adjustment test has been performed to validate the machining parameters, and the methodology of characterization. Secondly, a reference test on Alpha’s cast iron brought reference data for the comparison of the various metallurgies to be tested. This test has improved the method of characterization. Cutting forces recording appeared as the most relevant and irrelevant measurements such as surface roughness were eliminated from the method. A test performed on a second cast iron showed that it has a lower machinability. Project succeeded to characterize and compare cast irons’ machinabilities, allowing the improvement of the composition by further tests...|$|E

Ensuring good condition of brake lining is very crucial to ensure the efficiency of the braking system, where, the worn off brake lining not only endangers life but also damages the entire brake associated parts such as <b>hub,</b> <b>disk,</b> shaft, etc. In this paper, Malaysian made luxury car Proton Perdana V 6 brake pads were investigated to be embedded with a lining wear limit alert system. The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location. The embedment of the micro switch was successfully done and tested to be very efficient in alerting the driver upon reaching the maximum lining wear limit.

50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a bicycle wheel {{can be measured}} in three primary directions: radial, lateral, and torsional. The radial stiffness is primarily a measure of how well the wheel absorbs bumps from the surface on which it rolls. Lateral stiffness, especially of the front wheel influences the handling of the bicycle. Torsional, or tangential stiffness is a measure of how well the wheel transmits propulsive and braking forces, if applied at the hub, {{as in the case of}} <b>hub</b> or <b>disk</b> brakes.|$|R

40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{wind tunnel}} test was completed in support of ongoing conceptual design studies of the Stopped Rotor/Disk rotorcraft concept. A one-fifth scale model was tested in the NASA Ames Low-Speed 7 - by 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel # 1 to evaluate the low-speed cruise performance. The primary test objective was to compare performance characteristics for three possible conceptual designs of the Stopped Rotor/Disk cruise configuration: the large <b>hub</b> fairing (<b>disk)</b> alone, the disk/extended blades configuration, and the disk/conventional wing configuration. Results showed that the disk/extended blades configuration was the most efficient in low-speed cruise. Other test objecives included making parametric changes by varying the geometry of the disk and by varying the extended blade incidence angles. Studies were also conducted to examine the aerodynamic interaction between the disk and a conventional wing. An examination was made into {{the effects of the}} disk on static longitudinal stability. The wake generated by the disk impinged on a T-tail of the model and thus degraded longitudinal stability. Alternative tail geometries are required in order to improve the concept's static stability...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{deformation of}} the outer diameter of a shaft due to the <b>hub</b> press-fitting and <b>disk</b> clamping processes associated with a 2. 5 ″ hard disk drive. We propose a new robust shaft design to minimize the effect of deformation on the outer diameter of the shaft. We numerically show the effect of deformation on the shaft due to the pressure, stiffness, and damping coefficients of fluid dynamic bearings (FDBs), and the critical mass and excitation response of the rotor-bearing system. We also experimentally measured the axial non-repeatable runout and the amplitude at the half speed whirl frequency of FDBs with both conventional and proposed designs. Through these tests we confirm that the proposed design improves the static and dynamic performance of the FDBs and rotor-bearing system.

40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} {{different}} component of conveyor pulley (shell, end <b>disk,</b> <b>hub,</b> and shaft) failure and the stresses generated on them are discussed. The basic {{idea is to}} present the state of work about the conveyor pulley design analysis. The outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter {{is a measure of}} the flexible nature of the end disc. This ratio was approximately 6 to 8 by Leo J Laughlin [1]. If the ratio of outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter smaller, then conveyor pulley end disc will tend to be rigid. If the ratio of outer diameter of conveyor pulley to shaft diameter larger then conveyor pulley end disc will tend to be flexible. So conveyor pulley diameter to shaft diameter ratio in the range of five to eight then their stresses were fairly low. The paper was mainly focused on the improvement in the design and dimension of conveyor pulley which helpful for computational level. I...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the wheel rim and wheel hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad wheel designs, inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with wheel diameters ranging from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train wheels rims and DSR 2 mm for all other wheel rims. The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (<b>hub</b> and <b>disk</b> areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure). This presentation paper offers descriptions of, and results from three of these systems that have been integrated into manufacturing processes at German and Russian wheel manufacturers, and provides details on the following topics: Wheel rim inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 4 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Bochum, Germany) Wheel rim, hub and disc inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 2 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Ilsenburg, Germany) Wheel rim, hub and disc inspection, dual-tank immersion technique, 1 minute inspection cycle per wheel (Nishny-Tagil, Russia...|$|R
40|$|Several {{recently}} formulated nickel-base superalloys {{have been}} developed with excellent high-temperature creep resistance, at lower densities than those of currently used nickel-base superalloys. These alloys are the latest products of a continuing effort to develop alloys that have even greater strength-to-weight ratios, suitable for use in turbine blades of aircraft engines. Mass densities of turbine blades exert {{a significant effect on}} the overall weight of aircraft. For a given aircraft, a reduction in the density of turbine blades enables design reductions in the weight of other parts throughout the turbine rotor, including the <b>disk,</b> <b>hub,</b> and shaft, as well as supporting structures in the engine. The resulting total reduction in weight can be 8 to 10 times that of the reduction in weight of the turbine blades. The approach followed in formulating these alloys involved several strategies for identifying key alloying elements and the range of concentration of each element to study. To minimize the number of alloys needed to be cast, a design-of [...] experiments methodology was adopted. A statistics-based computer program that models the effects of varying compositions of four elements, including effects of two-way interactions between elements, was used to test all possible alloys within the design space. The starting points for the computational analysis were three alloy compositions mandated by engineering consensus. After likewise identification of key alloying elements to vary and the allowed ranges of concentrations, the computer program then selects a minimum number of alloys within the design space to allow determination of effects for all four elements and their interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the safe}} mode design stage of aero-engine, the whole engine safety can be {{improved}} by enhancing the safety of engine life-limited parts (ELLP). As one of ELLP, turbine disk works in thermal environments characterized by complexity and transient. This paper presents the analytical solutions of the transient temperature, thermally induced stress and equivalent stress distributions in a hollow disk rotating at a speed of 4000 r/min and subjected to complicated thermal boundary conditions. The outer surface of the disk is kept at a constant temperature, and the windward side is exposed to a forced convention to the cooling air. The inner surface is insulated until t = t_Qi after which the inner surface is uniformly heated by extra thermal loading Qi. The theoretical derivation of the governing energy equation with nonhomogeneous boundary and initial conditions is obtained by using the method of separation of variable (in other words, the eigenfunction method) for space variables and the method of Laplace transforms for the time variable. The transient calculations are performed individually for various start times of the thermal loading imposed on the inner surface, t_Qi = 0, 40, 100 and 120 s, as well as various values of the thermal loading, Qi = 60, 100 and 140 W, until the system attains thermal equilibrium state. From {{the perspective of the}} safety design, the influences of the start time and the value of the thermal loading Qi on the safety margin of a disk are evaluated respectively. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the reverse temperature difference at the <b>hub</b> of a <b>disk</b> rises, the value of maximum equivalent stress decreases and the shifting time of the position of maximum equivalent stress delays with advance of the start time t_Qi as well as increasing of the thermal loading on the inner surface Qi. Thus, the safety margin of a turbine disk can be enhanced by using the thermal loading imposed on the inner surface...|$|R
