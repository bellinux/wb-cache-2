No matter, said I to myself, I have been spared the trouble of getting out of bed for nothing. Why, it was only yesterday, said I, still thinking about the maize, that Pascuala, the cook, said to me when she put my dinner before me, 'Master, {{when are you going to}} buy some grain for the fowls? How can you expect the soup to be good when there is not even an egg to put in it? Then there is the black cock with the twisted toe--one of the second brood the spotted hen raised last summer, though the foxes carried off no less than three hens from the very bushes where she was sitting--he has been going round with drooping wings all day, so that I verily believe he is going to have the pip. And if any epidemic comes amongst the fowls as there was in neighbour Gumesinda's the year before last, you may be sure it will only be for want of corn. And the strangest thing is, and it is quite true, though you may doubt it, for neighbour Gumesinda told me only yesterday when she came to ask me for some parsley, because, as you know very well, <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> rooted up when the pigs broke into her garden last October; well, sir, she says the epidemic which swept off twenty-seven of her best fowls in one week began by a black cock with a broken toe, just like ours, beginning to droop its wings as if it had the pip.' ...|$|E

60|$|No better {{proof of}} Stephen's {{intellectual}} process and its {{result could be}} adduced than her first act of recognition: she summoned an elderly lady {{to live with her}} and matronise her house. This lady, the widow of a distant relation, complied with all the charted requirements of respectability, and had what to Stephen's eyes was a positive gift: that of minding <b>her</b> <b>own</b> business and not interfering in any matter whatever. Lady de Lannoy, she felt, <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> master and quite {{able to take care of}} herself. <b>Her</b> <b>own</b> presence <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that convention required.

When they were left alone together--which was not until noon, for Mr Boffin sat long in his easy-chair, by turns jogging {{up and down the}} breakfast-room, clenching his fist and muttering--Bella, in consternation, asked her what had happened, what was wrong? 'I am forbidden to speak to you about it, Bella dear; I mustn't tell you,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the answer she could get. And still, whenever, in her wonder and dismay, she raised her eyes to Mrs Boffin's face, she saw in it the same anxious and distressed observation of <b>her</b> <b>own.</b>|$|R
60|$|That was {{the sort}} of crisis which was at this moment {{beginning}} in Gwendolen's small life: she was for the first time feeling the pressure of a vast mysterious movement, for the first time being dislodged from her supremacy in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> world, and getting a sense that her horizon was but a dipping onward of an existence with which <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>was</b> revolving. <b>All</b> the troubles of her wifehood and widowhood had still left her with the implicit impression which had accompanied her from childhood, that whatever surrounded her was somehow specially for her, and it was because of this that no personal jealousy had been roused in her relation to Deronda: she could not spontaneously think of him as rightfully belonging to others more than to her. But here had come a shock which went deeper than personal jealousy--something spiritual and vaguely tremendous that thrust her away, and yet quelled all her anger into self-humiliation.|$|R
5000|$|Bird Pass or [...] "Saejae" [...] is {{the summit}} of a high mountain, rising north of Moonkyung in the ancient highway, linking Seoul with Miryang and Tongnae (Pusan). Its sky-kissing heights are rugged in their eyes. This is a love song of a dancer from Miryang who was left behind by her lover from Seoul (Hanyang). She is calling him to take her with him to Hanyang. She {{believed}} that <b>her</b> <b>own</b> beauty <b>was</b> above <b>all</b> flowers in Hanyang.

60|$|When {{the tumult}} had subsided, and habits and {{feelings}} {{had fallen into}} their old routine and relapsed into their ancient channels, the Marquess proposed that they should all return to London, and with great formality, though with warmth, begged that Madame Colonna would ever consider his roof as <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> <b>All</b> <b>were</b> glad to quit the Castle, which now presented a scene so different from its former animation, and Madame Colonna, weeping, accepted the hospitality of her friend, until the impending expansion of the spring would permit her to return to Italy. This notice of her return to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> country seemed to occasion the Marquess great disquietude.|$|R
60|$|She {{had written}} {{as though the}} matter was almost one {{of life and death}} to her. He could {{understand}} that too. His uncle's conduct to this woman, and his wife's, had created the intimacy which had existed. Through their efforts she had become almost as one of the family. And now to be dismissed, like a servant who had misbehaved herself! And then her arguments in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> defence <b>were</b> <b>all</b> so good,--if only that which Lady Cantrip had laid down as law was to be held as law. He was aware now that she had had no knowledge of the matter till his daughter had told her of the engagement at Matching. Then it was evident also that she had sent this Tregear to him immediately on her return to London. And {{at the end of the}} letter she accused him of what she had been pleased to call his usual tenacity in believing ill of her! He had been obstinate,--too obstinate in this respect, but he did not love her the better for having told him of it.|$|R
60|$|Once, upon a {{time there}} was a man and his wife who had two children, a boy and a girl. The wife died, and the man married again. His new wife had an only daughter, who was both ugly and untidy, whereas her {{stepdaughter}} was a beautiful girl, and was known as Maiden Bright-eye. Her stepmother was very cruel to her on this account; she had always to do the hardest work, and got very little to eat, and no attention paid to her; but to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> daughter she <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>was</b> good. She <b>was</b> spared from <b>all</b> the hardest of the housework, and had always the prettiest clothes to wear.|$|R
6000|$|Lillie, as queen in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> parlor, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> {{grace and}} indulgence. Hers was {{now to be}} the sisterly r√¥le, or, as she laughingly styled it, the maternal. With a ravishing morning-dress, and with a killing little cap of about three inches in extent on her head, she enacted the young matron, and gave full {{permission}} to Tom, Dick, and Harry to make themselves at home in her room, and smoke their cigars there in peace. She [...] "adored the smell;" [...] in fact, she accepted the present of a fancy box of cigarettes from Danforth with graciousness, and would sometimes smoke one purely for good company. She also encouraged her followers to unveil the tender secrets of their souls confidentially to her, and offered gracious mediations on their behalf {{with any of the}} flitting Newport fair ones. When they, as in duty bound, said that they saw nobody whom they cared about now she was married, that she was the only woman on earth for them,--she rapped their knuckles briskly with her fan, and bid them mind their manners. All this mode of proceeding gave her an immense success.|$|R
60|$|Damian groaned as she spoke, and was silent; while, maddened {{with the}} idea that he might be {{perishing}} for want of aid, Eveline repeated her efforts to extricate herself for her kinsman's assistance as well as <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> in vain, and she had ceased the attempt in despair; and, passing from one hideous subject of terror to another, she sat listening, with sharpened ear, for the dying groan of Damian, when--feeling of ecstasy!--the ground was shaken with horses' feet advancing rapidly. Yet this joyful sound, if decisive of life, did not assure her of liberty-- It might be the banditti of the mountains returning to seek their captive. Even then they would surely allow her leave to look upon and bind up the wounds of Damian de Lacy; for to keep him as a captive might vantage them more in many degrees, than could his death. A horseman came up--Eveline invoked his assistance, and the first word she heard was an exclamation in Flemish from the faithful Wilkin Flammock, which nothing save some spectacle of the most unusual kind was ever known to compel from that phlegmatic person.|$|R
50|$|Nzinga {{is one of}} Africa's best {{documented}} early-modern rulers. About a {{dozen of}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> letters <b>are</b> known (<b>all</b> but one published in Br√°sio, Monumenta volumes 6-11 and 15 passim). In addition, her early years are well described in the correspondence of Portuguese governor Fern√£o de Sousa, {{who was in the}} colony from 1624 to 1631 (published by Heintze). Her later activities are documented by the Portuguese chronicler Ant√≥nio de Oliveira de Cadornega, and by two Italian Capuchin priests, Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo and Antonio Gaeta da Napoli, who resided in her court from 1658 until her death (Cavazzi presided at her funeral). Cavazzi included a number of watercolours in his manuscript which include Njinga as a central figure, as well as himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{resolved}} to shut her hot-lidded eyes, but opened {{them in a}} little while to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing against the far wall. Then she saw a child--an untidy, thin-faced little girl of about ten, who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat. This proved--Frau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sick--proved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist. Frau Ebermann had had children of <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> but they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> grown up now, and she had never been a child-lover in any sense.

We <b>are</b> <b>all</b> {{influenced}} by past figures we admire, but in the case Daymere's protagonist, Allan Mellish, he has almost become his idol. Struggling with his desire to be a screenwriter and his awkwardness in high school, Allan tends to just lock himself away in his room and is constantly watching Woody Allen films or writing in his notepad. In his creative writing class, his work is finally challenged when a brilliant young girl named Mia makes Allan realize that every piece he writes is essentially an exact replica of a Woody Allen script. Allan is forced to look at himself and discover how to blend his love of Woody's style with his own. In doing so, Allan will finally be able to release his inner voice.

60|$|About {{the time}} the battle in the library was at its height, Mrs. Willoughby was alone in her room, having {{disposed}} of all the cares, {{and most of the}} duties of the day. The mother's heart was filled with a calm delight {{that it would have been}} difficult for herself to describe. All she held most dear on earth, her husband, her kind-hearted, faithful, long-loved husband; her noble son, the pride and joy of her heart; Beulah, <b>her</b> <b>own</b> natural-born daughter, the mild, tractable, sincere, true-hearted child that so much resembled herself; and Maud, the adopted, one rendered dear by solicitude and tenderness, and now so fondly beloved on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> account, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> with <b>her,</b> beneath <b>her</b> <b>own</b> roof, almost within the circle of her arms. The Hutted Knoll was no longer a solitude; the manor was not a wilderness to her; for where her heart was, there truly was her treasure, also. After passing a few minutes in silent, but delightful thought, this excellent, guileless woman knelt and poured out her soul in thanksgivings to the Being, who had surrounded her lot with so many blessings. Alas! little did she suspect the extent, duration, and direful nature of the evils which, at that very moment, were pending over her native country, or the pains that <b>her</b> <b>own</b> affectionate hear? <b>was</b> to endure! The major had not suffered a whisper of the real nature of his errand to escape him, except to his father and the chaplain; and we will now follow him to his apartment, and pass a minute, t√™te-√†-t√™te, with the young soldier, ere he too lays his head on his pillow.|$|R

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's {{hard to figure out}} what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey‚Äôs sequel to 1994‚Äôs buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording <b>her</b> <b>own</b> song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> sake <b>is</b> <b>all</b> over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} like that we are describing, events occur much more rapidly than they can be related. The Plantagenet was now within pistol-shot of le Scipion, and on her weather bow. At that precise instant, when the bow-guns, on both sides, began to play, the Carnatic, then nearly in a line with the enemy, made a rank sheer to leeward, and drove on, opening in the very act with her weather-bow guns. The Thunderer and Warspite imitated this man[oe]uvre, leaving the Frenchman the cheerless {{prospect}} of being attacked on both sides. It {{is not to be}} concealed that M. de Ch√©lincourt was considerably disturbed by this sudden change in his situation. That which, an instant before, had the prospect of being a chivalrous, but extremely hazardous, passage in front of a formidable enemy, now began to assume the appearance of something very like destruction. It was too late, however, to remedy the evil, and the young Comte, as brave a man as existed, determined to face it manfully. He had scarcely time to utter a few cheering sentiments, in a dramatic manner, to those on the quarter-deck, when the English flag-ship came sweeping past in a cloud of smoke, and a blaze of fire. His <b>own</b> broadside <b>was</b> nobly returned, or {{as much of it as}} the weather permitted, but the smoke of both discharges was still driving between his masts, when the dark hamper of the Carnatic glided into the drifting canopy, which was made to whirl back on the devoted Frenchman in another torrent of flame. Three times was this fearful assault renewed on the Scipio, at intervals of about a minute, the iron hurricane first coming from to windward, and then seeming to be driven back from to leeward, as by its own rebound, leaving no breathing time to meet it. The effect was completely to silence <b>her</b> <b>own</b> fire; for what between the power of the raging elements, and the destruction of the shot, a species of wild and blood-fraught confusion took the place of system and order. Her decks were covered with killed and wounded, among the latter of whom was the Comte de Ch√©lincourt, while orders were given and countermanded in a way to render them useless, if not incoherent. From the time when the Plantagenet fired her first gun, to that when the Warspite fired her last, was just five minutes by the watch. It seemed an hour to the French, and but a moment to their enemies. One hundred and eighty-two men and boys were included in the casualties of those teeming moments on board the Scipio alone; and when that ship issued slowly from the scene of havoc, more by the velocity of her assailants in passing than by <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> the foremast <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that stood, the remainder of her spars dragging under her lee. To cut the last adrift, and to run off nearly before the wind, in order to save the spars forward, and to get within the cover of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> fleet, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that could now be done. It may as well be said here, that these two objects were effected.|$|R
6000|$|She still pursued me. [...] "You will observe, monsieur, {{and tell}} me what you think; I could so much better rely on your opinion than on my own; women cannot judge of these things as men can, and, excuse my pertinacity, monsieur, but it is natural I should feel {{interested}} about this poor little girl (pauvre petite); she has scarcely any relations, <b>her</b> <b>own</b> efforts <b>are</b> <b>all</b> she has to look to, her acquirements must be her sole fortune; her present position has once been mine, or nearly so; it is then but natural I should sympathize with her; and sometimes when I see the difficulty she has in managing pupils, I reel quite chagrined. I doubt not she does her best, her intentions are excellent; but, monsieur, she wants tact and firmness. I have talked to her on the subject, but I am not fluent, and probably did not express myself with clearness; she never appears to comprehend me. Now, would you occasionally, when you see an opportunity, slip in a word of advice to her on the subject; men have so much more influence than women have--they argue so much more logically than we do; and you, monsieur, in particular, have so paramount a power of making yourself obeyed; a word of advice from you could not but do her good; even if she were sullen and headstrong (which I hope she is not), she would scarcely refuse to listen to you; for my own part, I can truly say that I never attend one of your lessons without deriving benefit from witnessing your management of the pupils. The other masters are a constant source of anxiety to me; they cannot impress the young ladies with sentiments of respect, nor restrain the levity natural to youth: in you, monsieur, I feel the most absolute confidence; try then to put this poor child into the way of controlling our giddy, high-spirited Brabantoises. But, monsieur, I would add one word more; don't alarm her AMOUR PROPRE; beware of inflicting a wound there. I reluctantly admit that in that particular she is blameably--some would say ridiculously--susceptible. I fear I have touched this sore point inadvertently, and she cannot get over it." ...|$|R

To him she <b>was</b> devoted, <b>all</b> her doings <b>were</b> {{with a view to}} please him, and deserve his affection; he was her world, and sole object. Indeed, she was sometimes startled by perceiving that tenderly as she loved <b>her</b> <b>own</b> family, <b>all</b> <b>were</b> subordinate to him. She had long since known the true name of her feelings for him; she could not tell when or how the certainty had come, but she was conscious that it was love that they had acknowledged for one another and that she only lived in the light of his love. Still she did not realize the evil of concealment; it was so deep a sensation of her innermost heart, that she never could imagine revealing it to any living creature, and she had besides so surrendered her judgment to her idol, that no thought could ever cross her that he had enjoined what was wrong. Her heart and soul were his alone, and she left the future to him without an independent desire or reflection. All the embarrassments and discomforts which her secret occasioned her were met willingly for his sake, and these were not a few, though time had given her more self-command, or, perhaps, more properly speaking, had hardened her.|$|R
