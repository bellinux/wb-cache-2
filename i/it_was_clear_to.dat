She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> us how she {{has remained on}} top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, {{and there was no}} place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out {{as a last resort}} regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} {{any ideas}} for a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E

25|$|As the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army {{finished}} clearing southern Germany {{and approached}} Austria, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> most observers, Allied and German alike, {{that the war}} was nearly over. Many towns flew white flags of surrender to spare themselves the otherwise inevitable destruction suffered by those that resisted, while German troops surrendered by the tens of thousands, sometimes as entire units.|$|E
25|$|On the Fascist side, {{after the}} fall of Tunis and Pantelleria, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> many that the war had been lost. The landing in Sicily and the lack of {{resistance}} shocked the Fascists, who asked themselves why the Duce was not reacting. Many of them looked to the King, and many at Mussolini.

25|$|In the assembly, 80 of 130 deputies, all {{close to}} the government, showed their displeasure {{with the idea of}} {{replacing}} George, a development that threatened to plunge the island anew into revolt.

25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and {{set the tone for}} most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains something of the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E
25|$|King James II was {{campaigning in}} Ireland {{as a first}} step in an {{ultimately}} unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne following his deposition after the Glorious Revolution. In August 1689, Marshal Frederick Schomberg had been sent from England to bolster the forces loyal to King William but after the Siege of Carrickfergus his army had stalled through the winter of 1689–90, suffering from sickness and desertion. As early as January 1690, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> William {{that he would have to}} sail to Ireland, with substantial reinforcements, to salvage the situation.|$|E

25|$|About noon Custer's men heard cannon fire, Stuart's {{signal to}} Lee {{that he was}} in {{position}} and had not been detected. About the same time Gregg received a message warning that a large body of rebel cavalry had moved out the York Pike and might be trying to get around the Union right. A second message, from Pleasonton, ordered Gregg to send Custer to cover the Union far left. Since Gregg had already sent most of his force off to other duties, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> both Gregg and Custer that Custer must remain. They had about 2700 men facing 6000 Confederates.|$|E
25|$|By late March 1752, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> {{everyone}} that Ava's fate was sealed. Hanthawaddy forces had breached Ava's outer defenses, and pushed Avan defenses inside the palace walls. At Moksobo in the Mu valley about 60 {{miles northwest of}} Ava, one village headman named Aung Zeya persuaded 46 villages in home region {{to join him in}} resistance. Aung Zeya proclaimed himself king with the royal style of Alaungpaya (the Future Buddha), and founded the Konbaung Dynasty. He prepared the defenses by stockading his village, now renamed Shwebo, and building a moat around it. He had the jungle outside the stockade cleared, the ponds destroyed and the wells filled.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Keefe {{retired as}} President of the ILA in 1908, succeeded by another Great Lakes tugboat man, T.V. O'Connor. O'Connor's {{presidency}} spanned {{twelve of the}} ILA's most intriguing and influential years. In 1909, a bitter three-year strike on the Great Lakes pitted the employers' Lake Carriers' Association against every maritime union except the ILA, whose locals wisely voted against participation because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> them {{from the beginning that}} the strike was a losing battle. So powerful and well equipped was the Lake Carriers' Association that Lakes shipping ran almost regularly despite the union walk out. In the end, the ILA was almost alone on the Lakes.|$|E
