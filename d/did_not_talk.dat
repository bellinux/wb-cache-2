5|$|All four of her {{grandparents}} had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex {{history of the}} U.S., but her extended family has said that people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the era of slavery when they were growing up. Her distant ancestry includes Irish and other European roots. In addition, a paternal first cousin once-removed is the African-American Jewish Rabbi Capers Funnye, son of her grandfather's sister.|$|E
5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master. Melvinia <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to relatives about Dolphus' father. Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, {{and some of his}} children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E

5|$|Madame Schmidt <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the}} matter even after the war. She died in 1954 {{at the age of}} 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E

Although Thompson became a famous symbol of White motherhood, her heritage is Native American. The photograph's fame caused distress for Thompson and her children and raised ethical concerns about turning individuals into symbols.|$|E
25|$|In 1935–36 and 1937–38, Belaney toured Canada and Britain (including Hastings) {{to promote}} his books and lecture about conservation.

Belaney appeared in traditional Ojibwa clothing {{as part of his}} fraudulent First Nations identity.

25|$|In 2003, {{an honorary}} degree and public {{platform}} {{was given to}} pro-choice Holy Cross alumnus Chris Matthews despite pro-life alumni objections. College President Fr.

McFarland along {{with the majority of}} the current Holy Cross community continue to defend this, stating that while Matthews is pro-choice, that is not his defining characteristic and he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> purely about abortion in his speech.|$|E
25|$|Minh {{was allowed}} to emigrate to France in 1983 and settled near Paris, and it was again assumed that the communists had {{permitted}} him to leave {{on the basis that}} he remain aloof from politics and history. In the late 1980s, there was speculation he would be allowed to return to Vietnam to live out his last years, but this did not happen. In the last few years of his life, he lived in Pasadena, California, with his daughter, Mai Duong. He later needed a wheelchair for mobility. In exile, Minh kept his silence, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the events in Vietnam, and did not produce a memoir.|$|E
25|$|Although Inayat Khan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> {{about her}} {{activities}} under interrogation, the SD found her notebooks. Contrary to security regulations, she had copied {{out all the}} messages she had sent as an SOE operative (this {{may have been due}} to her misunderstanding what a reference to filing meant in her orders, and also the truncated nature of her security course due to the need to insert her into France as soon as possible). Although she refused to reveal any secret codes, the Germans gained enough information from them to continue sending false messages imitating her. As a WAAF signaller, Inayat Khan had been nicknamed 'Bang Away Lulu' because of her distinctively heavy-handed style, which was said to be a result of chilblains.|$|E

25|$|During a 2015 {{visit to}} King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Gabriel {{launched}} an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer Raif Badawi and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice {{in a region}} in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past. He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip. His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and Islamic State militants, particularly given Germany’s status as Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports. While the U.S. State Department had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844-1938), who {{was held}} {{as a slave}} {{on a farm in}} Clayton County, North Georgia. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near Rex. He would have worked along with his slaves. Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860. Melvinia <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to relatives about his father. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said the father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. After the Civil War, Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while they were growing up. Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.|$|E
25|$|Following {{consultations}} {{with a number}} of ministers of State, King Albert received Herman Van Rompuy (CD), the outgoing President of the Chamber of Representatives, and charged him with an exploratory mission in order to find a solution to the political crisis. Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice. He met on August 30 with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD), Bart De Wever (N-VA), Bart Somers (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On August 31, he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF) and Jean-Michel Javaux (Ecolo). The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discreetly. De Standaard noted that Van Rompuy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> with a member of the PS, which could mean he wanted to reach the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.|$|E

25|$|Wyeth {{created a}} {{stimulating}} household for his talented children Andrew Wyeth, Henriette Wyeth Hurd, Carolyn Wyeth, Ann Wyeth McCoy, and Nathaniel C. Wyeth. Wyeth was very sociable, and frequent visitors included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Hugh Walpole, Lillian Gish, and John Gilbert. According to Andrew, {{who spent the}} most time with his father {{on account of his}} sickly childhood, Wyeth was a strict but patient father who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> down to his children. His hard work as an illustrator gave his family the financial freedom to follow their own artistic and scientific pursuits. Andrew went on {{to become one of the}} foremost American artists of the second half of the 20th century, and both Henriette and Carolyn became artists also; Ann became an artist and composer. Nathaniel became an engineer for DuPont and worked on the team that invented the plastic soda bottle. Henriette and Ann married two of Wyeth's protégés, Peter Hurd and John W. McCoy. Wyeth is the grandfather of artists Jamie Wyeth and Michael Hurd and the musician Howard Wyeth.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on June 26, 2014 in Berlin. Shortly before production {{began in}} Berlin, Core got {{the cast and}} crew together to watch the original Point Break. The new team did not reach out to the original cast and crew; Bracey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to Reeves, and Core did not reach out to director Kathryn Bigelow, though Ramirez did seek and receive the director's blessing. Shooting took place in a total of 11 countries across four continents, using actual extreme sports stars and stuntmen. Locations include Berlin/Germany, Hall in Tirol, Lienz and Carinthia/Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Hawaii, Tahiti, Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Venezuela, France, India, and the United Kingdom. While the original film focused on just a few sports – primarily surfing – and used cranes and other Hollywood trickery to portray them, the new movie eschewed all of that, including green screens, and relied on real life practical stunts. For the numerous stunts performed in the film, Core gathered a group of the best snowboarders, free rock climbers, big wave surfers, high-speed motocross riders and wingsuit pilots in the world and filmed them, essentially, as actors.|$|E
25|$|In her {{concession}} {{speech on}} the night of the PS victory, Berta Cabral assumed personal responsibility for her party's loss, and promised to maintain her position in the assembly, while failing to clarify her intentions to vacate the leadership of the PSD Açores. In the last four regional elections, the regional leaders of the PSD have been removed by its membership, following their defeats in the regional elections. Speaking following the victory of the PS, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho recognized that the national context, and in particular the austerity measures had interfered in the results (even as he praised the work by the regional deputies and parties). During the campaign Artur Lima counseled the national leader, Paulo Portas, to abandon the coalition with the PSD, while Berta Cabral announced that she would order a vote against the state budget by PSD deputies from the Azores, if the budget confirmed an increase in the IRS or IMI. Passos Coelho was the only national leader of the major parties who did not participate in the campaign, while Paulo Portas limited his interventions to a few hours in Terceira, during a CDS commission-dinner, where he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> of national politics and evaded journalists questions.|$|E

Despite this, HAL became the first company to establish a license with Namco for developing games. He joined the company in a full-time capacity after graduating in 1982, becoming its fifth employee and only programmer. Around the same time, Iwata's father was elected mayor of Muroran.
