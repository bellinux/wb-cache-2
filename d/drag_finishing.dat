There was used a cutter head with just one indexable insert for finishing machining. The article can answer to question, if the K factor can help to increase the tool performance, because the influence of the asymmetrical form factor will be compared with symmetric form factor, it means K = 1.

40|$|Metal {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) is increasingly {{used to create}} complex 3 D components at near net shape. However, the surface finish (SF) of the metal AM part is uneven, with surface roughness being variable over the facets of the design. Standard post-processing methods such as grinding and linishing often meet with major challenges in finishing parts of complex shape. This paper reports on research that demonstrated that mass finishing (MF) processes are able to deliver high-quality surface finishes (Ra and Sa) on AM-generated parts of a relatively complex geometry (both internal features and external facets) under select conditions. Four processes were studied in this work: stream finishing, high-energy (HE) centrifuge, <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> and disc finishing. Optimisation of the <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> process was then studied using a structured design of experiments (DOE). The effects {{of a range of}} finishing parameters were evaluated and optimal parameters and conditions were determined. The study established that the proposed method can be successfully applied in <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> to optimise the surface roughness in an industrial application and that it is an economical way of obtaining the maximum amount of information {{in a short period of}} time with a small number of tests. The study has also provided an important step in helping understand the requirements of MF to deliver AM-generated parts to a target quality finish and cycle time...|$|E

40|$|Anew mass {{finishing}} technology, namely dragfinishingof brass (Cu- 30 wt. % Zn) rings with fluidized abrasives, is reported. A new equipment, which combines the typical {{features of the}} <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> machines to hold the workpiece with the moving abrasives of fluidized beds, was designed. The equipment was validated by performing several experimental tests varying rotary speed and processing time. The evolution of the surface morphology of the workpieces, their mass loss and dimensional accuracy after processing were assessed after each finishing step. The designed equipments allowed to finish {{with a high level}} of accuracy and in short time range the brass rings. Material removals and out-of-tolerances of the workpieces could be limited once the appropriate settings of the process were selected. Low energy requirements, lack of any residuals after processing and facile operations make the fluidized bed assisted <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> industrially sustainable and very promising in several manufacturing domains. © 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

40|$|<b>Drag</b> <b>finishing</b> is {{a highly}} {{attractive}} finishing technology for ductile metals as it combines the features of loose abrasive technologies with the high automation level and control of metal cutting (machining) technologies. Fluidized bed assisted <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> provides the additional advantage to simplify the moving device of the workpiece. In addition, fluidization reduces the energy consumption necessary to move the workpiece through the abrasives, which, being taken in a fluid-like state, offer less resistance to the advancing workpiece. This technology was proved to ensure high-quality finishing of ductile metals like brass, whose surface can be easily processed to become mirror-like. Although experimental practice has allowed to raise significant knowledge in the field, the comprehension of the basic mechanisms involved during finishing process and theoretical modeling of the related material removal are still missing.

This is due to their excellent high-temperature performances and their significantly lower density compared to Nickel-based superalloys.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the work on}} the characterisation and evaluation of an entirely new mass finishing product based wholly on thermally treated recycled glass, which acts as both a bond and abrasive for mass finishing and superfinishing processes. The recycling of glass is excellent in respect of sustainability and environmental efficiency. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish requirements for the high volume manufacture of thermally treated recycled glass preforms to satisfy stated performance criteria. Several powder characterization techniques were employed to assess morphology and flowability of various grades of soda lime glass powder. The results obtained have demonstrated that flowability and packing properties improve with an increase of particle size. Thermal analyses were successfully employed for various types of mould material to determine the optimal glass powder size in terms of crystallinity and mechanical properties. It was found that by controlling the time transformation temperature TTT relationship, it is possible to consistently produce abrasive media possessing particular mechanical and physical properties that deliver target mass finishing performance. The residual stresses developed during different thermal cycles were investigated numerically and experimentally. Compressive stress was observed near the media edge and tensile stress in the mid-plane at the end of the solidification process. The results showed that the numerical FEA code is a suitable tool for the prediction of residual stresses of thermally treated recycled glass. A study concerned with the tip geometry of the Vickers and Berkovich indenters was completed to ensure an accurate contact area determination. A new method is proposed for the determination of contact area based on residual imprint measurements using 3 -D optical profilometry. The outcomes show that by measuring contact area with the new method the overall relative error in the obtained mechanical properties is improved. A combined Finite Element Analysis FEA and optimization algorithm has been developed using various indentation processes to determine the mechanical properties of a wide range of materials, using target FE indentation curves which were then extended to actual glass media taking into account the predicted residual stress in the material. The results obtained from the proposed methods of dual indenters and optimization algorithm have demonstrated that excellent convergence can be achieved with the target FE indentation curve of complex material systems; and also accurate results have been obtained for the actual glass. The material characterization tests were extended to investigate the fracture toughness based on the stress fields mapped at the unloading stage of the Vickers indentation. The median and Palmqvist crack systems were analysed separately using FEA. Dimensionless analyses were then carried out, and the critical SIF (fracture toughness) derived for the measured crack length and material properties. The developed numerical models were validated with the experimental data proposed by many researchers over a wide range of material properties as well as Vickers indentation induced cracking of thermally treated glass. The performance programme was designed as a comparative study with a range of conventional media that included an industrial benchmark media. Performance indicators included surface roughness and brightness. The results of the laboratory based research studies provided promising evidence that the thermally treated glass media has a process capability and performance comparable to that of conventional media. The glass media was trailed on a production machine annexed for this purpose. Turbine blades were employed as the component for these trails. The results though very promising did identify that a heavy workpiece may crush some media thereby generating small shards that may scratch or impair a fine surface finish (contribute against Ra). However, a novel jig arrangement was designed to hold the part in a horizontal position and allowed free rotation of the workpiece with the media flow in the trough. The new system was successfully used to deliver better performance results with the conventional and thermally treated recycled glass media. The kinematics of the mass finishing process were investigated with a two-dimensional discrete element model (DEM) developed to perform single-cell circulation in a vibratory bed. The sensitivity of the predicted model corresponding to the contact parameters was considered and the parameters were optimized with respect to the experimental results of media velocity vectors using particle image velocimetry (PIVLab). The results suggested that the bulk circulation increases with increasing bed depth resulting in an increase in pressure and shear forces between particle layers. The optimization of the advanced mass <b>finishing</b> (<b>Drag</b> and Stream <b>finishing</b> process) process has been studied using the design and analysis of experiment (DOE) approach. Regression analyses, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Taguchi methodology and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) have been chosen to aid this study. The effects of various finishing parameters were evaluated and the optimal parameters and conditions determined. The interaction of finishing parameters was established to illustrate the essential relationship between process parameters and surface roughness. The predicted models were confirmed by experimental validation and confirmation finishing trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrag {{finishing}} is a {{machining process}} {{that is used to}} improve the surface topology of workpieces. Workpieces are moved through a bulk of differently shaped abrasives, the so called media. Material removal is caused by the relative motion between workpiece and media. The material removal rate is mainly depending on the contact intensity between workpiece and media. Up to now there is no viable way to determine the intensity of single contacts empirically. However, a sound understanding of single contacts with respect to impact forces and velocities could greatly improve process comprehension and reduce trial and error process design efforts. For that reason the movement of media and workpiece is modelled using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). In this paper a comprehensive approach is presented covering formulation, calibration, validation and utilization of the DEM. Media is considered as an aggregation of elastic particles that are subject to contact, damping and gravitational forces causing particle movement. Geometric boundary conditions, i. e. workpiece and <b>drag</b> <b>finishing</b> bowl, are implemented as elastic facets. Contact forces are calculated according to a non-linear, simplified Hertz-Mindlin contact force model. Energy is dissipated by viscous damping and friction at contacts. Necessary parameters of the model are determined experimentally. The validation of the model's behaviour shows good agreement with experimental data. Finally the model is used to determine local contact intensities on the workpiece surface and between particles. By analysing simulated contact forces, the formation of dominant contact chains between particles is observed and investigated...|$|E
