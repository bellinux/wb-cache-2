In this study, the {{spatial distribution of}} the most important subtidal habitats (coral reefs, coral carpets, seagrass meadows, sand with corals, macroids, mud, hardgrounds) and mangroves was mapped in northern Safaga Bay and at Ras Banas, Red Sea, Egypt.

Coral associations were analyzed separately for their ecological and spatial patterns. This, coupled with information about major current patterns in the bay, provided a framework on which to base impact predictions for planned developments or those already under way. Since the entire shoreline of Safaga Bay and Ras Banas are earmarked for tourism development, the following impacts are already observed (Safaga Bay) and can be expected to worsen: dredging, coastal infilling, marina construction, alteration of <b>inshore</b> <b>current</b> patterns due to breakwater construction, eutrophication.

Selected case studies {{as well as a}} front detection algorithm applied to the SST data provide some new insights into the dynamics of Natal Pulses and the variability of the northern Agulhas Current. Over the measurement period, the path of the Agulhas <b>Current's</b> <b>inshore</b> front does not exhibit any seasonality. Instead, large excursions in the Agulhas <b>Current's</b> <b>inshore</b> front are dominated by the intermittent passage of offshore cyclonic meanders from the Natal Bight and Port Edward regions to Port Elizabeth. SST imagery reveals that as they progress downstream, Natal Pulses interact with the topography to form secondary offshore meanders which propagate in the lee of the original perturbation. Over time, these secondary meanders dissipate, remerge with the original Natal Pulse, or detach from the Agulhas Current. Fluctuations in the Agulhas <b>Current</b> <b>inshore</b> path do not display the same frequency characteristics at all transects. From the northern Natal Bight to Port Edward both the size and frequency of Natal Pulses increases, while south of Port Edward the number of Natal Pulses decreases.

40|$|Hawaiian waters show a {{trend of}} {{increasing}} temperature {{over the past}} several decades that are consistent with observations in other coral reef areas of the world. The first documented large-scale coral bleaching occurred in the Hawaii region during late summer of 1996, with a second in 2002. The bleaching events in Hawaii were triggered by a prolonged regional positive oceanic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly greater than 1 1 C that developed offshore during the time of annual summer temperature maximum. High solar energy input and low winds further elevated inshore water temperature by 1 – 2 1 C in reef areas with restricted water circulation (bays, reef flats and lagoons) and in areas where mesoscale eddies often retain water masses close to shore for prolonged periods of time. Data and observations taken during these events illustrate problems in predicting the phenomena of large-scale bleaching. Forecasts and hind-casts of these events are based largely on offshore oceanic SST records, which are only a first approximation of inshore reef conditions. The observed oceanic warming trend is the ultimate cause of the increase in the frequency and severity of bleaching events. However, coral reefs occur in shallow inshore areas where conditions are influenced by winds, orographic cloud cover, complex bathymetry, waves and <b>inshore</b> <b>currents.</b> These factors alter local temperature, irradiance, water motion and other physical and biological variables known to influence bleaching...|$|R
40|$|The Leeuwin Current {{strengthens}} {{considerably from}} February to May each year, following the slackening of southerly coastal winds; strong eddies develop. A high-resolution, multilevel, primitive equation ocean model {{is used to}} examine this eddy development in an idealized way, by considering the development of flow from rest when temperatures are initially given the observed longshore gradients. The system is allowed to geostrophically adjust {{in the absence of}} longshore winds and of any surface heat flux. Two types of experiments are conducted. The first type uses the Indian Ocean climatological temperature gradient forcing (case 1 and 2), while the second type repeats the first experiment with the added contribution of the North West Shelf (NWS) temperature profile (cases 3 and 4). To investigate the additional effects of coastline irregularities, cases 1 and 3 use an ideal coastline, while cases 2 and 4 use an irregular (realistic) coastline. In all cases, maximum surface velocities occur at Cape Leeuwin, where the Leeuwin Current changes direction, and off Southern Australia. Maximum undercurrent velocities occur off Western Australia. In case 1, Cape Leeuwin and the Western Australian coast are the preferred locations for the development of warm, anticyclonic eddies, which are generated due to a mixed instability mechanism. In case 2, the warm, anticyclonic eddies occur in the vicinity of coastal promontories and at Cape Leeuwin. While advection of warm water is present along the entire coast in case 1, the irregular coastline geometry limits the extent of warm water in case 2. The added contribution from the NWS water in cases 3 and 4 augments the onshore geostrophic inflow to produce a model Leeuwin Current and undercurrent that are more vigorous and unstable than in the previous cases. In case 3, the NWS water adds strong horizontal shear to the coastal equatorial region of the domain and vertical shear to the <b>inshore</b> <b>current.</b> It also advects warmer water along the entire coast. In case 4, the addition of both the NWS water and the irregular coastline results in the establishment of a stronger surface current and undercurrent than in the previous cases; however, the irregular coastline limits the extent of the advection of the NWS warmer water along the Australian coast...|$|E

The model was forced using wind stresses from the National Center for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data prescribed at the sea surface, large-scale remote forcing determined from a North Atlantic model, monthly mean temperature and salinity climatology, and M 2 tide on the open boundary. The model results were examined against various in situ observations (moored current meter, tide gauge, and vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler data) and satellite drift measurements and discussed together with literature information. The seasonal mean circulation solutions were investigated in terms of relative importance of wind to density forcing for the Labrador Current. The model results indicate significant seasonal and spatial variations, consistent generally with previous study results and in approximate agreement with observations for the major currents.

30|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance {{patterns of the}} leptocephali {{in the present study}} provided no clear information about their spawning locations or larval transport patterns possibly because spawning by each species may occur locally and not in specific spawning areas. Ocean currents and eddy patterns in this region are likely to be complex, making it difficult to estimate larval transport patterns. Surface <b>currents</b> <b>inshore</b> of the Mentawai Islands are thought to be to the southeast parallel to the coast of western Sumatra (Wyrtki 1961), and large eddies move past western Sumatra (Hacker et al. 1998; Vinayachandran et al. 1999; Iskandar et al. 2006). Upwelling sometimes occurs off the coast of western Sumatra that would transport surface water offshore (Susanto et al. 2001). In addition, strong eastward equatorial jets lasting about 10 to 20 days typically occur during May to the northwest of the study area (Thompson et al. 2006; Sengupta et al. 2007; Kantha et al. 2008), which could have a major effect on the variability of currents and eddies around the Mentawai Islands.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} wind forcing, bottom topography and thermohaline gradients on classical as well as unique features of the Leeuwin Current system (LCS), five experiments are conducted with a sigma coordinate, primitive equation model on a beta-plane. The first experiment, which investigates the pressure gradient force error, shows that velocity errors, inherent in three dimensional sigma coordinate models, can be successfully reduced from ~ 100 cm/s to ~ 1 cm/s in the LCS. The second experiment, which highlights the effect of annual wind forcing on a flat bottom with horizontally averaged climatology, portrays some classical features of eastern boundary currents such as an equatorward surface current and upwelling. The third experiment uses horizontally averaged climatology and annual winds, but adds realistic topography to investigate {{its role in the}} LCS.

40|$|Dispersal {{rates are}} known to play a {{fundamental}} role in establishing the genetic structure found within a species. Dispersal in marine benthic invertebrates is largely dependent on life history strategy. The presence of pelagic larvae will potentially result in high dispersal within a species, while direct development limits dispersal. This study used two intertidal pulmonate limpet species to investigate the relationship between dispersal potential and genetic structure of populations. Siphonaria capensis produces benthic egg masses, which release pelagic larvae. These float in ocean currents before settling and metamorphosing into adults. S. serrata reproduces by direct development. The larvae hatch as completely metamorphosed juveniles after developing in an egg case not far from the parent. The high dispersal capacity of S. capensis pelagic larvae should result in high levels of within-population variation since individuals within a particular population may originate from several different populations. This should lead to high levels of gene flow along the coast and to low genetic differentiation among populations. On the other hand, the low dispersal potential of S. serrata should cause low levels of genetic variation within populations, as relatives will remain close to one another. Low levels of gene flow and high genetic differentiation among populations are expected in this species. In dealing with the relationship between life history strategy and population genetic structure in these two species, a series of indirect techniques was utilised. Multivariate analyses of the morphological variation within each species showed that variation in size was similar between the two species and largely governed by environmental factors. Variation in shell shape was largely under genetic control and supported the predictions made for each species. Variation in total proteins was relatively uninformative in terms of examining {{the differences between the two}} species. Allozyme analysis and mtDNA sequencing clearly showed differences between the species in terms of their population genetic structure. High levels of gene flow were found within S. capensis. This was strongly influenced by ocean currents, with the close <b>inshore</b> Agulhas <b>current</b> along the Transkei coast contributing to high levels of dispersal and hence gene flow. Low levels of gene flow occurred within S. serrata, resulting in low within-population variation and high among-population differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The Brazil Current is {{the western}} {{boundary}} current {{component of the}} South Atlantic subtropical gyre circulation. It is a small current, transporting less than 20 × 106 m 3 s- 1 of water where the current is adjacent to the continental margin. The low transport and the shallow water location have hindered descriptions using traditional hydrographic methods. Historical hydrographic data, satellite AVHRR imagery, and recent absolute velocity and temperature measurements are used to develop a more complete picture of the Brazil Current over the latitude range 20 to 31 ∘S. ^ Satellite imagery for the period 1982 - 87 confirms that the Brazil Current is continuous along the South American continent at least from 19 ∘S to the region of continental margin separation south of 31 ∘S. Over this range the <b>inshore</b> Brazil <b>Current</b> front is {{closely associated with the}} continental margin, represented by the 200 m isobath. North of the separation region the imagery-determined mean frontal position was generally within 20 km of the 200 m isobath. The variability about the mean position contains two maxima associated with areas of sharp continental margin convex curvature (observed from shore). Results from applying Brazil Current characteristics to a model of local boundary current separation (Ou and De Ruijter, 1986) suggest that separation will not occur in either region under normal flow conditions. A more likely explanation of the observed variability is different distances of local inertial overshoot for different transport values. ^ Absolute velocity dropsonde data confirm earlier observations that at 24 ∘S the Brazil Current is confined to the upper portion of the water column, depths less than 450 m. A representative mean transport is around 7 × 106 m 3 s- 1. At 31 ∘S the Brazil Current vertical extent deepens to around 800 m, and the transport increases to about 18 × 106 m 3 s- 1. Part of the increase is due to entrainment of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) {{at the base of the}} Brazil Current. At both locations a significant fraction of the flow can occur in shallow water over the continental shelf, and adjacent to the continental slope there exists a northward flowing AAIW current immediately below the Brazil Current. ...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{integrated}} physical and biological approach, we examined across-shelf advection and exchange {{and the associated}} transport of bivalve larvae {{in the presence of}} a strong coastal current separated from the coast by a stratified inshore environment. We tested the hypothesis that the interface of the coastal <b>current</b> and <b>inshore</b> waters can act as an ecological barrier to across-shelf transport of larvae but can be overcome by wind- or tidally-induced transport. Our study region in the Gulf of Maine encompasses a coastal current that diverges from the coast as it moves downshelf. The region <b>inshore</b> of this <b>current</b> is home to several species that exhibit limited recruitment in spite of extensive upshelf larval sources. Analysis of surface water temperatures and wind velocities revealed episodic decreases in temperature along the coast correlated with alongshelf (but not upwelling) winds, indicating wind-forced onshore movement of the cold coastal current. Such wind-driven onshore migrations are more common along the northern portion of the study region where the coastal current is near the coast, tidal currents are strong, and wind directions are more conducive to onshore migration, but rarer further south where the interface between inshore waters and the coastal current is further offshore and suitable wind events are less common. The distribution of bivalve larvae was consistent with the physical measurements.

The spring transition, as seen in coastal sea level and winds, occurred in mid-March. Surface variability during the two spring cruises was stronger and of larger scale than that seen during the two winter cruises. An equatorward-tending current, flowing along the boundary between low steric sea level inshore and high steric sea level offshore, dominated both the directly-measured (acoustic Doppler current profiler) and geostrophic current fields during spring. Current jets of comparable strength directed both offshore and onshore were seen off Cape Mendocino and Point Arena; these evolved significantly in the 3 weeks between cruises. <b>Inshore</b> of the <b>current,</b> properties associated with upwelled water were found near the surface, including low temperature and high salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll; offshore of the current, waters were warmer, less saline, lower in nutrients and more oligotrophic. Geostrophic and directly measured volume transports in the current were about 2 – 3 Sv. Isopycnals inshore of the spring upwelling front were displaced vertically by O(40 – 80 m) from their depths during the winter survey; these displacements extended deep into the water column and were largely independent of depth between 100 and 400 m.

40|$|Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and {{chinstrap}} penguins (P. antarctica) are morphologically and ecologically very similar, {{have very}} similar diet and breed sympatrically in the Scotia Arc from the South Sandwich Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula. To investigate how these two species co-exist, their foraging distribution and diet were studied during the chick-rearing period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, during the breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Satellite tracking data from of 19 Adelie penguins and 24 chinstrap penguins {{were used to}} compare foraging distributions. In both years the diet of both species was exclusively Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) {{of the same size}} range. In a year of low prey availability (2000), there was a statistically significant segregation of foraging areas between the two species, however, in a year of normal resource availability (2001) there was no such segregation. There was {{a significant difference in the}} foraging areas used by Adelie penguins between years but not for chinstrap penguins. Adelie penguins foraged significantly farther (mean 100 km) from the colony than chinstrap penguins (mean 58 km) in 2000 but not in 2001 (mean 58 km and 35 km respectively). In 2000, the breeding success of Adelie penguins was 51 % lower than the long-term mean compared to 15 % lower in chinstrap penguins. Both species achieved above average breeding success in 2001. The changes in foraging distribution and breeding success suggest that in years of low resource availability, chinstrap penguins may be able to competitively exclude Adelie penguins from potential <b>inshore</b> foraging areas. <b>Current</b> trends in climatic change and possible effects on ice distribution and krill abundance suggest that conditions could become less favourable for Adelie penguins than chinstrap penguins in areas where both species occur...|$|R
40|$|Copepods, minute crustaceans, {{are vital}} {{constituents}} of marine food web dynamics in tropical ecosystems. Ecologically, copepods provide {{the link between}} primary production and tertiary consumers. Changes in population structure and densities may impact ecosystem stability and production on small to large spatial scales. The present study examined {{the influence of the}} Florida Current on copepod population densities off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida due to limited data in the area. Samples were collected during February and July 2007 at two locations, Stations A and B. Station A, dependent on current dynamics, fluctuated between the most western boundary and the inshore waters adjacent to the coast. Station B was typically located within the Florida Current showing great influence from the current’s physical factors. The current, acted as a physical barrier, entrapping species at near shore stations, increasing population densities by increased nutrient loads through upwelling and land runoff. The movement of the <b>current</b> <b>inshore</b> showed a greater resurgence of oceanic species at each station. However, {{the western edge of the}} current, acting as a barrier, yielded the lowest population densities overall and among all copepod orders. The decrease can influence food web dynamics and the prey availability to higher tertiary consumers. Population dynamics were ascertained by relative copepod densities identified to the lowest possible taxa and enumerated. Calanoid copepods were dominant in zooplankton samples, showing high instances of Calanus and Undinula, followed by Poecilostomatoida, highly represented by Corycaeus and Oncaea, and Cyclopoida. Poecilostomatoid densities were numerically important, where in some samples Corycaeus contributed to 42 % of overall copepod densities. Previous studies have led to their underestimation, due to gear selectivity and extrusion directly related to their prosome length. Diversity levels revealed an overall diverse habitat, typical of tropical environments. However, there was greater diversity in coastal waters as compared to the Florida Current which was only found oceanic species present...|$|R
40|$|Physical fields whose sources {{exist within}} {{maritime}} vessels are {{of concern to}} ship-designers and military planners. Among the fields of most significance which have been studied intensively, are those of magnetic, acoustic and pressure sources. New technological developments now require analyses of the underwater electric and magnetic fields of onboard, extremely low-frequency electromagnetic sources. This study investigated methods by which the electromagnetic sources of maritime vessels may be characterised during normal operations in typical coastal environments. It focused on situations where both the sources and field measurement points were located in a common seawater volume. At the electromagnetic frequencies of interest such a medium acts as a thin conducting layer with significant levels of wave reflection and refraction at the media boundaries. To enhance propagation models of the electromagnetic fields over short ranges, the initial investigations aimed to characterise key parameters of the conducting media in shallow-water conditions Conductivity values of seawater can be readily established by conventional methods. However, {{in the case of}} the seabed media, direct conductivity measurements are usually highly variable along horizontal and vertical sections due to aeons of land erosion, and the long-term effects of <b>inshore</b> waves and <b>currents.</b> Procedures are described which show how electromagnetic theory and indirect measurement techniques may be used to infer the characteristic values of key seabed parameters in shallow-water areas. This element of the study utilised both analytical and numerical electromagnetic models, and the efficacy of each in this context was examined. Subsequent phases of the study analysed the nature of the electromagnetic sources. In some situations the sources were regarded as point dipoles, and in others they were assumed to have a finite length. Techniques were developed to characterise the dipole moment, length and the location of a typical ship-like source, when each is treated as an electric current dipole. This information was used in turn to demonstrate the likely accuracy in ranging operations on extremely low-frequency, electromagnetic sources over short ranges, and in shallow-water conditions...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fourteen {{years ago}} there was a ship cruisin' in the Pacific, jest off this range, that was ez nigh on to a Hell afloat as {{anything}} rigged kin be. If a chap managed to dodge the cap'en's belayin-pin for a time, he {{was bound to be}} fetched up in the ribs at last by the mate's boots. There was a chap knocked down the fore hatch with a broken leg in the Gulf, and another jumped overboard off Cape Corrientes, crazy as a loon, along a clip of the head from the cap'en's trumpet. Them's facts. The ship was a brigantine, trading along the Mexican coast. The cap'en had his wife aboard, a little timid Mexican woman he'd picked up at Mazatlan. I reckon she didn't get on with him any better than the men, for she ups and dies one day, leavin' her baby, a year-old gal. One of the crew was fond o' that baby. He used to get the black nurse {{to put it in the}} dingy, and he'd tow it astern, rocking it with the painter like a cradle. He did it--hatin' the cap'en all the same. One day the black nurse got out of the dingy for a moment, when the baby was asleep, leavin' him alone with it. An idea took hold on him, jest from cussedness, you'd say, but it was partly from revenge on the cap'en and partly to get away from the ship. The ship was well <b>inshore,</b> and the <b>current</b> settin' towards it. He slipped the painter--that man--and set himself adrift with the baby. It was a crazy act, you'd reckon, for there wasn't any oars in the boat; but he had a crazy man's luck, and he contrived, by sculling the boat with one of the seats he tore out, to keep her out of the breakers, till he could find a bight in the shore to run her in. The alarm was given from the ship, but the fog shut down upon him; he could hear the other boats in pursuit. They seemed to close in on him, and by the sound he judged the cap'en was just abreast of him in the gig, bearing down upon him in the fog. He slipped out of the dingy into the water without a splash, and struck out for the breakers. He got ashore after havin' been knocked down and dragged in four times by the undertow. He had only one idea then, thankfulness that he had not taken the baby with him in the surf. You kin put that down for him: it's a fact. He got off into the hills, and made his way up to Monterey." ...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The main aim of {{this study}} was to analyse ships' drift data for the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans in order to find out more about the general {{characteristics}} and seasonal flow patterns of the surface ocean currents in these regions. A ship's drift observation consists of the difference between a course steered between two positions (estimated arrival time is based on the speed of the ship through the water) and the course made good during the same period (figure 1. 1). The speed of the drift can be computed by dividing the vector difference by the time elapsed. Since the most important contributors to the drift of a ship are the surface ocean currents, ship's drift data can be analysed in order to provide information about the speeds and directions of flow of the surface ocean currents in a particular area. Data, showing the mean prevailing winds, were also obtained from oceanic climatic atlases in order to investigate the relationship between the winds and the surface ocean currents. The ships' drift data as well as the wind data were used to investigate the following characteristics of the ocean currents in the study area: Geographic location including their spatial and temporal variability Speeds and directions of flow including their spatial and temporal variability The relationship between the currents and the mean prevailing winds and The eddy kinetic energy (a measure of variability around the mean flow) associated with the currents. Additional features investigated included: The discontinuity of the Mozambique Current The source currents of the Agulhas Current, and The possible existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, known as the Mozambique Ridge Current. The geographical locations, as well as the speeds and directions of flow of the main surface ocean currents in the study area were successfully determined, with the exceptions of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents. These exceptions can be traced to the lack of data in the regions in which these currents occur. A large seasonal difference in the speeds of flow of the South Equatorial (in the Indian Ocean), the East Madagascar and the northern Mozambique Currents was found. The southern Mozambique, the Agulhas and Benguela Current as well as the <b>currents</b> <b>inshore</b> of the Agulhas Current over the Agulhas Bank were shown to exhibit small seasonal differences in their speeds of flow. Owing to a lack of data, very little could be determined regarding the seasonal variability of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents. A seasonal variability pertaining to the geographical location of the extreme northern Mozambique Current was determined, but no seasonal variability was found in relation to the geographical location of any of the other currents in the study area. In the northern parts of the South West Indian Ocean a strong relationship was found between the mean prevailing winds and the surface currents. The main driving force for the currents in this region would seem to be the winds. However, as these currents flow southwards and become stronger, as is the case for the Agulhas Current, the relationship between the winds and the currents appears to be somewhat weaker. This may be owing to the fact that the main driving force for these currents is not the winds but the inflow of water from the north. In regions where the currents are weak, such as the Benguela Current region and the Agulhas Bank area, the relationship between the winds and currents was also shown to be strong. The eddy kinetic energy gives a measure of the variability around the mean flow of a current. Often this variability is manifested by the presence of eddy features. Some regions exhibited high values of eddy kinetic energy. These areas included: Parts of the East-Madagascar Current Parts of the Mozambique Current The Agulhas Current, including the region of the Agulhas Retroflection, and Parts of the South Equatorial Current in the Indian Ocean. Two areas of special interest regarding the eddy kinetic energy are the regions of the Agulhas and Madagascar Currents Retroflections. In these areas values of eddy kinetic energy greater then 750 cm 2 /s 2 occur (figure 4. 34). This appears to reinforce the findings of previous researchers, that have postulated the existence of current retroflections in these areas and have indicated that these areas are regions for the formation of eddy features. Unfortunately the maps and charts generated from ships' drift data do not provide clear representations of the retroflections of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Currents. This is owing to the high degree of spatial and temporal variability of these current retroflections. Thus, despite the difficulty of providing conclusive evidence for the existence of these features from ships' drift data, this investigation into the eddy kinetic energy in this study may give additional evidence for the possible presence of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Current Retroflections. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western boundary current. Both the Mozambique and the East Madagascar Currents were shown to be source currents for the Agulhas Current, but probably in a weak and intermittent manner. The source water from the East Madagascar Current may be in the form of eddies. The existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, could not be verified from ships' drift data. This study makes two significant contributions to the descriptive physical oceanography of the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans. These are: A detailed analysis relating to the seasonal variability of the currents. In the case of the Benguela Current; the- investigation into the seasonal variability was more detailed than any previous study. A comprehensive investigation pertaining to the eddy kinetic energy associated with the currents. This was done on a one degree grid scale. The only other study which used ships' drift data to examine the eddy kinetic energy for these regions used a five degree grid scale, which could lead to the smoothing out of high values associated with narrow western boundary currents...|$|R
