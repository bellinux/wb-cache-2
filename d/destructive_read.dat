Sharing and {{mutability}} {{are inherent}} in object-oriented languages, but they make precise typestate analysis difficult: state changes made via one alias need to be reflected in other aliases. Therefore, typestate analysis requires alias information and uniqueness {{has proven to be}} essential for accuracy of analysis. Present alias analyses either require programmer annotations or are unable to infer uniqueness in the presence of lending, whereby a unique reference is tem-porarily passed to a method. In this paper, we propose a modular method to infer uniqueness properties for object-oriented languages. We advocate a restricted form of lending, which we call lent-once, to ensure exclusive access to the referenced object and thus al-low state changes to be captured. Furthermore, unlike previous alias type systems which rely on <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> for object fields to guarantee uniqueness, we do not impose any such change on the semantics of the underlying language. We achieve this by maintaining a set of consumed uniqueness that is tracked in a flow-sensitive manner, with each field’s uniqueness assured at method boundary. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Passive {{crossbar}} {{arrays of}} memristors have been iden-tified as excellent alternatives for future random-access memories. One limitation is their inability of selecting a memory cell without the interference {{caused by the}} sneak-path currents from other partially selected cells, as it results not only in unnecessary waste of energy but also in larger current requirements. The complementary resistive switch (CRS), consisting in two anti-serially connected memristors, is considered a potential solution to the sneak-path problem. However, the <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> operation and reduced endurance of the CRS render it unattractive for the otherwise excellent candidate for next-generation crossbar-based non-volatile memories. In this paper we explore the feasibility and tradeoffs of configuring part of the CRS memory into a memristive mode to mitigate these limitations. The inherent locality of memory accesses for most computer programs offers an opportunity for designing a cache-like adaptive CRS-based crossbar memory with hybrid configurations of CRS and memristive modes, enabling optimization for both endurance and energy consumption. Our simulation results validate that the proposed hybrid system achieves 1. 5 - 7 x reduction in energy consumption in comparison with a memristive-only memory system and significantly improves the endurance of the CRS-based memory.

40|$|Abstract. A good {{object-oriented}} effects system {{gives the}} ability to define abstract regions (or &quot;data groups&quot;) of state within objects that can be extended in subclasses. Then one can specify (for instance) read and write effects on these abstract regions. Additionally, effects on &quot;wholly owned subsidiary &quot; objects {{should be seen as}} effects on regions of the owning object. For instance, an assignment within a bucket of a hash table should be seen as an effect on the hash table alone. Correctness of this transfer of effects depends on the bucket being accessible only through the hash table; it must be unique. Uniqueness can be guaranteed using <b>destructive</b> <b>reads</b> (in which a unique variable can be used at most once). <b>Destructive</b> <b>reads</b> are inconvenient, so most uniqueness systems permit borrowing reads as well, in which a temporary alias of a unique variable is permitted. But if the unique variable is read during the lifetime of this alias, the uniqueness invariant fails. So we wish to ensure that this read effect does not happen. For modularity reasons, we use effects annotations on methods to check for such read effects. Thus we see that effects and uniqueness depend on each other. Our position is that the use of annotations breaks the cyclic dependence as long as the annotations are given semantics independent of the analyses. As a semantics of uniqueness annotations is already available, we then sketch a semantics of effects annotations independent of uniqueness. Thus decoupled, one can prove the correctness of a uniqueness analysis and an effects analysis without regard for the other...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY An unshared object can be {{accessed}} without regard to possible conflicts with other parts of a system,whether concurrent or single-threaded. A unique variable (sometimes known as a `free ' or `linear ' variable) is one that either is null or else refers to an unshared object. Being able to declare and check which variablesare unique improves a programmer's ability to avoid program faults. In previously described uniqueness extensions to imperative languages, a unique variable can {{be accessed}}only with a <b>destructive</b> <b>read,</b> which nullifies it after the value is obtained. This approach suffers from several disadvantages: the use of destructive reads increases {{the complexity of the}} program which must continuallyrestore nullified values; adding destructive reads changes the semantics of the programming language; and many of the nullifications are actually unnecessary. We demonstrate instead that uniqueness can be preserved through the use of existing language features. We give a modular static analysis that checks (nonexecutable) uniqueness annotations superimposed on animperative programming language without destructive reads. The `alias-burying ' intuition is that aliases that are `dead ' (will never be used again) can be safely `buried ' (made undefined) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{emerging}} nonvolatile memory systems necessitate efficient read/write (R/W) schemes. Efficient solutions with zero sneak path current, nondestructive R/W operations, minimum area and low power {{are some of}} the key requirements. Toward this end, we propose a novel crossbar memory scheme using a configuration row of cells for assisting R/W operations. The proposed write scheme minimizes the overall power consumption compared to the previously proposed write schemes and reduces the state drift problem. We also propose two read schemes, namely, assisted-restoring and self-resetting read. In assisted-restoring scheme, we use the configuration cells which are used in the write scheme, whereas we implement additional circuitry for self-reset which addresses the problem of <b>destructive</b> <b>read.</b> Moreover, by formulating an analytical model of R/W operation, we compare the various schemes. The overhead for the proposed assisted-restoring write/read scheme is an extra redundant row for the given crossbar array.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{application of}} unique object references {{is safe and}} efficient message passing in concurrent object-oriented programming. However, to prevent the ill effects of aliasing, practical systems often severely restrict the shape of messages passed by reference. Moreover, the problematic interplay between destructive reads–often used to implement unique references–and temporary aliasing through “borrowed ” references is exacerbated in a concurrent setting, increasing the potential for unpredictable run-time errors. This paper introduces {{a new approach to}} uniqueness. The idea is to use capabilities for enforcing both at-most-once consumption of unique references, and a flexible notion of uniqueness. The main novelty of our approach is a model of uniqueness and borrowing based on simple, unstructured capabilities. The advantages are: first, it provides simple foundations for uniqueness and borrowing. Second, it can be formalized using a relatively simple type system, for which we provide a complete soundness proof. Third, it avoids common problems involving borrowing and <b>destructive</b> <b>reads,</b> since unique references subsume borrowed references. We have implemented our type system as an extension to Scala. Practical experience suggests that our system allows type checking real-world actor-based concurrent programs with {{only a small number of}} additional type annotations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} and coupling between magnetization {{and electric}} polarization in multiferroic materials provide extra {{degrees of freedom}} for creating next-generation memory devices. A variety of concepts of multiferroic or magnetoelectric memories have been proposed and explored in the past decade. Here we propose a new principle to realize a multilevel nonvolatile memory based on the multiple states of the magnetoelectric coefficient (α) of multiferroics. Because the states of α depends on the relative orientation between magnetization and polarization, one can reach different levels of α by controlling the ratio of up and down ferroelectric domains with external electric fields. Our experiments in a device made of the PMN-PT/Terfenol-D multiferroic heterostructure confirm that the states of α can be well controlled between positive and negative by applying selective electric fields. Consequently, two-level, four-level, and eight-level nonvolatile memory devices are demonstrated at room temperature. This kind of multilevel magnetoelectric memory retains all the advantages of ferroelectric random access memory but overcomes the drawback of <b>destructive</b> <b>reading</b> of polarization. In contrast, the reading of α is nondestructive and highly efficient in a parallel way, with an independent reading coil shared by all the memory cells. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The complexity in the circuits leads to the need of that type of circuits which are portable and fast circuits. The portability in the electronic circuits are achieved {{by the use of}} battery. So we have to develop such type of circuits that consume very less power. The major focus in designing a high performance digital system such as microprocessors and various Digital signal Processors is given to low power design. The main part of any digital system is its memory unit. It is not possible to design a digital system without memory. So we can say that memory is the main part which utilize the maximum power in the system. The most used memory cell in the digital systems is the SRAM cells. They are the static RAM cells. Low-power Random Access Memory (RAM) has seen a remarkable and rapid progress in power reduction.

40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{have been}} in constant progression since the first prototype in 1958, with the semiconductor industry maintaining a constant rate of miniaturisation of transistors and wires. Up until about the year 2002, processor performance increased by about 55 % per year. Since then, limitations on power, ILP and memory latency have slowed the increase in uniprocessor performance to about 20 % per year. Although the capacity of DRAM increases by about 40 % per year, the latency only decreases by about 6 { 7 % per year. This performance gap between the processor and DRAM leads to a problem known as the memory wall. This thesis aims to improve system memory latency by leveraging available resources with excess capacity. This has been achieved through multiple techniques, but mainly by using excess bandwidth and improving scheduling policies. The first approach presented, <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> DRAM, changes the underlying assumptions about {{the contents of a}} DRAM cell being unchanged after a read. The latency of a read is reduced, {{but the rest of the}} memory system requires changes to conserve data. Prefetching predicts what data is needed in the future and fetches that data into the cache before it is referenced. This dissertation presents a technique for generating highly accurate prefetches with good timeliness called Delta Correlating Prediction Tables (DCPT). DCPT uses a table indexed by the load's address to store the delta history of individual loads. Delta correlation is then used to predict future misses. Delta Correlating Prediction Tables with Partial Matching (DCPT-P) extends DCPT by introducing L 1 hoisting which moves data from the L 2 to the L 1 to further increase performance. In addition, DCPT-P leverages partial matching which reduces the spatial resolution of deltas to expose more patterns. The interaction between the memory controller and the prefetcher is especially important, because of the complex 3 D structure of modern DRAM. Utilizing open pages can increase the performance of the system significantly. Memory controllers can increase bandwidth utilization and reduce latency at the same time by scheduling prefetches such that the number of page hits are maximized. The interaction between the program, prefetcher and the memory controller is explored. This thesis examines the impact of having a shared memory system in a CMP. When resources are shared, one core might interfere with another core's execution by delaying memory requests or displacing useful data in the cache. This effect is quantified and which components are most prone to interference between cores identified. Finally, we present a framework for measuring interference at runtime.

In order {{to reinforce the}} accelerating pace, novel materials with unique properties are being proposed on an urgent basis. This list includes one dimensional nanotubes, quasi one dimensional nanowires, two dimensional atomistically thin layered materials like graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and the more recently the rich family of transition metal di-chalcogenides comprising of MoS 2, WSe 2, WS 2 and many more for logic applications and organic and inorganic ferroelectrics, phase change materials and magnetic materials for memory applications. Only time will tell who will win, but exploring these novel materials allow us to revisit the fundamentals and strengthen our understanding which will ultimately be beneficial for high performance device design. ^ While there has been growing interest in two-dimensional (2 D) crystals other than graphene, evaluating their potential usefulness for electronic applications {{is still in its}} infancies {{due to the lack of}} a complete picture of their performance potential. The fact that the 2 -D layered semiconducting di-chalcogenides need to be connected to the 2 ̆ 2 outside 2 ̆ 2 world in order to capitalize on their ultimate potential immediately emphasizes the importance of a thorough understanding of the contacts. This thesis demonstrate that through a proper understanding and design of source/drain contacts and the right choice of number of MoS 2 layers the excellent intrinsic properties of this 2 D material can be harvested. A comprehensive experimental study on the dependence of carrier mobility on the layer thickness of back gated multilayer MoS 2 field effect transistors is also provided. A resistor network model that comprises of Thomas-Fermi charge screening and interlayer coupling is used to explain the non-monotonic trend in the extracted field effect mobility with the layer thickness. The non-monotonic trend suggests that in order to harvest the maximum potential of MoS 2 for high performance device applications, a layer thickness in the range of 6 - 12 nm would be ideal. Finally using scandium contacts on 10 nm thick exfoliated MoS 2 flakes that are covered by a 15 nm ALD grown Al 2 O 3 film, record high mobility of 700 cm 2 /Vs is achieved at room-temperature which is extremely encouraging for the design of high performance logic devices. ^ The destructive nature of the readout process in Ferroelectric Random Access Memories (FeRAMs) is one of the major limiting factors for their wide scale commercialization. Utilizing Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistor RAM (FeTRAM) instead solves the <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> out problem, but at the expense of introducing crystalline ferroelectrics that are hard to integrate into CMOS. In order to address these challenges a novel, fully functional, CMOS compatible, One-Transistor-One-Transistor (1 T 1 T) memory cell architecture using an organic ferroelectric – PVDF-TrFE – as the memory storage unit (gate oxide) and a silicon nanowire as the memory read out unit (channel material) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. While evaluating the scaling potential of the above mentioned organic FeTRAM, it is found that the switching time and switching voltage of this organic copolymer PVDF-TrFE exhibits an unexpected scaling behavior as a function of the lateral device dimensions. The phenomenological theory, that explains this abnormal scaling trend, involves in-plane interchain and intrachain interaction of the copolymer - resulting in a power-law dependence of the switching field on the device area (ESW α ACH 0. 1) that is ultimately responsible for the decrease in the switching time and switching voltage. These findings are encouraging since they indicate that scaling the switching voltage and switching time without aggressively scaling the copolymer thickness occurs naturally while scaling the device area – in this way ultimately improving the packing density and leading towards high performance memory devices. ...|$|E

The metaphor of landscape as dwelling {{is derived from}} the art philosophy of Martin Heidegger, which emphasises the importance of truth as aletheia (or “disclosure”), the cultural geography of John Wylie, which illuminates the notion of landscape as tension, and the anthropology of Tim Ingold with reference to the dwelling perspective, adopted from Heidegger’s philosophy on dwelling. The thesis destructs the Cartesian idea of landscape, which relates to the constructivist description of landscape as a way of seeing. The <b>destructive</b> <b>reading</b> shows that mortals’ dwelling on earth is inherently part of the landscape, which means that landscape opens up as an expression of Dasein’s fundamental being-in-the-world, rather than a scene looked upon from afar. Furthermore, this thesis uses Ingold’s distinction between the landscape and the taskscape (Ingold, 2000 : 195), and Heidegger’s notion of the fourfold (Heidegger, 1989 : 172), to make a desctructive reading of the poets’ work, with specific reference to William Spanos’s destructive criticism. It investigates a number of poems from Breytenbach’s Nine landscapes of our time bequeathed to a beloved (Nege landskappe van ons tye bemaak aan ŉ beminde, 1993), Paper flower (Papierblom, 1998), The wind-catcher (Die windvanger, 2007), The principle of dust (Die beginsel van stof, 2011) and Catalects (Katalekte, 2012), and Lucebert’s Harvests in the roaming garden (Oogsten in de dwaaltuin, 1981), The swamp rider from paradise (De moerasruiter uit het paradijs, 1982), Console the hysterical robot (Troost de hysterische robot, 1989), Of the malt-like profligate (Van de maltentige losbol, 1993) and Of the motionless agitator (Van de roerloze woelgeest, 1994). The analyses focus specifically on the destruction of the traditional landscape idea by emphasising Dasein’s everyday activities, and his/her dis-covering approach toward the elements of the fourfold. The thesis concludes with a comparison of the work of the poets in terms of their destruction of the notion of landscape, the temporality of the taskscape, the taskscape as an ensemble of tasks, and a systematic reading of dwelling.

40|$|Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) {{technology}} is a rapidly emerging field {{in science and technology}} due to its potential applications as position sensors in automotive electronics, eddy current sensors for non <b>destructive</b> testing, magnetic <b>read</b> heads and magnetic random access memory. This technology has already established a potential market for magnetic read heads. However, lot of interests has been generated in the scientific community to replace the Hall or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) elements by GMR materials due its higher sensitivity. This review article presents an overview of different structure of magnetic multilayers deposited by plasma processes to observe the GMR effect. Magnetic multilayers with different compositions and deposition parameters are discussed in detail and their magnetic and magnetotransport properties are presented. A brief discussion on application of these materials as an eddy current sensor and position sensors is given...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} dynamic faults in core-cell of SRAM memories. These faults are the consequence of resistive-open defects that appear more frequently in VDSM technologies. In particular, the study concentrates on those defects that generate dynamic <b>Read</b> <b>Destructive</b> Faults, dRDFs. In this paper, we demonstrate that read or write operations on a cell involve a stress on the other cells of the same word line. This stress, called Read Equivalent Stress (RES), has the same effect than a read operation. On this basis, we propose to modify the well known March C-, which does not detect dRDFs, into a new version able to detect them. This is obtained by changing its addressing order {{with the purpose of}} producing the maximal number of RES. This modification does not change the complexity of the algorithm and its capability to detect the former target faults...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to study the {{relationship}} between affective responses to social comparison and test scores among high school students Our analyses showed that three types of responses to social comparison could be distinguished: an empathic, constructive, and destructive response. Whereas girls scored higher on empathic response, boys scored higher on destructive response. In addition, students who had a high social comparison orientation (SCO) scored higher on all three types of responses than students who expressed a low SCO Multilevel regression analyses indicated that, after controlling for previous performance, a destructive response was negatively related to performance on tests for reading comprehension and mathematics An empathic response was positively related to performance on reading comprehension only whereas a constructive response compensated the negative relationship between <b>destructive</b> response and <b>reading</b> comprehension Theoretical and practical implications are discussed (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the electrical origins of dynamic <b>Read</b> <b>Destructive</b> Faults (dRDFs) that affects the SRAM memories. This fault is the consequence of resistive-open defects in the refreshment loop of the SRAM core-cells. The consequence of this fault is that multiple consecutive read operations on a cell may induce the faulty swap of the stored value. In a recent paper, we have considered only two of the four possible dRDF fault primitives. Here, we complete this study by evaluating the effectiveness of all fault primitives. We also show that read or write operations on a cell involve a stress on the other cells of the same word line. This stress, called Read Equivalent Stress (RES), has the same effect as an actual read operation for the dRDF sensitization. On this basis, we demonstrate that RESs can replace actual read operations in the dRDF fault primitives making them more efficient...|$|R
