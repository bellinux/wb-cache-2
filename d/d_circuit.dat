40|$|For circuit classes R, the {{fundamental}} computational problem Min-R asks for the minimum R-size of a Boolean function {{presented as a}} truth table. Prominent examples of this problem include Min-DNF, which asks whether a given Boolean function presented as a truth table has a k-term DNF, and Min-Circuit (also called MCSP), which asks whether a Boolean function presented as a truth table has a size k Boolean circuit. We present a new reduction proving that Min-DNF is NP-complete. It is significantly simpler than the known reduction of Masek [30], which is from Circuit-SAT. We then give a more complex reduction, yielding the result that Min-DNF cannot be approximated to within a factor smaller than (logN) γ, for some constant γ> 0, assuming that NP is not contained in quasipolynomial time. The standard greedy algorithm for Set Cover is often used in practice to approximate Min-DNF. The question of whether Min-DNF can be approximated to within a factor of o(logN) remains open, but we construct an instance of Min-DNF on which the solution produced by the greedy algorithm is Ω(logN) larger than optimal. Finally, {{we turn to the}} question of approximating circuit size for slightly more general classes of circuits. DNF formulas are depth two circuits of AND and OR gates. Depth <b>d</b> <b>circuits</b> are denoted by AC 0 d. We show {{that it is hard to}} approximate the size of AC 0 <b>d</b> <b>circuits</b> (for large enough d) under cryptographic assumptions...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the satisfiability problem for circuits of limited size and/or depth. Say that an algorithm solving a Boolean satisfiability problem on n variables is improved iff {{it takes time}} O(2 cn) for some constant c < 1, i. e. iff it is exponentially better than a brute force search. We show an improved algorithm for the satisfiability problem for circuits of constant depth and linear size. If improved upper bounds are not possible for a variant where the size is somewhat more than linear or the depth grows, can we provide evidence regarding the hardness of the problem? (note to authors: Did we actually discuss this question in greater depth in the paper? Maybe this should be reworded.) For each d and c, we give a randomized algorithm solving the satisfiability problem for depth <b>d</b> <b>circuits</b> with n variables and at most cn gates in time 2 (1 −δ) n where δ ≥ 1 /O(c 2 d− 2 − 1 lg 3 · 2 d− 2 − 2 c), and the constant in the big-Oh depends only on d.

40|$|Abstract. Let C be a depth- 3 circuit with n variables, degree d and top fanin k (called ΣΠΣ(k, <b>d,</b> n) <b>circuits)</b> over base field F. It {{is a major}} open {{problem to}} design a {{deterministic}} polyno-mial time blackbox algorithm that tests if C is identically zero. Klivans & Spielman (STOC 2001) observed {{that the problem is}} open even when k is a constant. This case has been subjected to a serious study over the past few years, starting from the work of Dvir & Shpilka (STOC 2005). We give the first polynomial time blackbox algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm runs in time poly(n) dk, regardless of the base field. The only field for which polynomial time algorithms were previously known is F = Q (Kayal & Saraf, FOCS 2009, and Saxena & Seshadhri, FOCS 2010). This is the first blackbox algorithm for depth- 3 circuits that does not use the rank based approaches of Karnin & Shpilka (CCC 2008). We prove an important tool for the study of depth- 3 identities. We design a blackbox polynomial time transformation that reduces the number of variables in a ΣΠΣ(k, <b>d,</b> n) <b>circuit</b> to k variables, but preserves the identity structure.

50|$|Formed {{from the}} Arizona State League in 1931, the Arizona-Texas League was a class <b>D</b> <b>circuit</b> that ran from '31-'32 and '37-'39. In '40-'41 it was {{promoted}} to class C, then halted play from 1942 to 1946. In '47-'50 the league again organized and competed until 1951 when it merged with the Sunset League to form the Southwest International League. Chihuahua Dorados joined the league towards the end in 1952, winning 57 and losing 83, finishing 27 and 1/2 games out of first. Though the team did not win as many games as expected, they drew an impressive 130,329 fans in 70 home games in 1952; out drawing every other {{team in the league}} by double.|$|E

Our focus is on polynomials that can be written in the form f(¯x) = ∑ k i= 1 hi(¯x) · gi(¯x), where each hi is a polynomial that depends on only ρ linear functions, and each gi is a product of linear functions (when hi = 1, for each i, then we get the class of depth- 3 circuits with k multiplication gates, also known as ΣΠΣ(k) circuits, but the general case is much richer). When maxi(deg(hi · gi)) = d we say that f is computable by a ΣΠΣ(k, <b>d,</b> ρ) <b>circuit.</b> We obtain the following results. 1.
