50|$|In 1841, William II {{authorised}} {{the first}} constitution of Luxembourg. This document left all meaningful {{power in the}} hands of the sovereign. The legislature provided by the Constitution, the Assembly of Estates, was little more than a shadow parliament. It was elected indirectly, the ballots were not secret, and the vast majority of the population were excluded from political life by a system of census suffrage, requiring the payment of 10 florins per year in tax. At the elections of 1845, in the canton of Luxembourg, only 956 out of 28,477 inhabitants were eligible to vote. The Assembly's sessions were held in private, and its assent was required only for penal and fiscal laws, the civil list, and the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>budget.</b> In 1841, this constitution was generally welcomed, but over the years, voices started to be raised in the Assembly of Estates, demanding a return to the civil liberties which had applied under the Belgian annexation of 1830-1839. Various other issues were a cause for discontent, such as the muzzling of the press, the ban on associations, the exorbitant expenses of the civil list, and lack of judicial and educational reforms.|$|E

40|$|Resolving the International Debt Crisis Since August 1982 the {{international}} debt crisis has dominated economic policymaking {{in the developing}} countries, economic relations between the debtor and creditor countries, {{the attention of the}} multilateral institutions in their dealings with the debtor nations, and private sector decisions on lending to the developing countries. The period since 1982 has seen some progress. Neither the commercial nor central banks have had to deal with formal large—scale debt defaults. Balance sheets of creditor banks have been strengthened. There is an active secondary market in developing country debt, and debt to equity swaps are a reality. For the debtors, real interest rates have fallen between 1982 and 1987.

Net exports showed <b>extraordinary</b> growth. <b>Budget</b> deficits have been reduced despite falling incomes. In 1987 commodity prices have begun to recover. The period has seen a shift toward rather than away from democracy. But five years after it began, the debt crisis is very much alive. None of the major Latin American countries has restored normal access to {{the international}} capital markets. At least one major debtor has been in trouble each year. Three classes of solutions are described and evaluated. Least radical are proposals for procedural reform and changes {{in the nature of the}} claims on the existing debt. Some procedural reforms such as multiyear reschedulings and exit vehicles for smaller banks have already begun to be instituted. Others include changes in accounting rules, and U. S. information provision on foreign accounts held in the U. S. Changes in the nature of claims include debt-equity swaps, country funds, interest capitalization, and payment by the debtors in their own currency. The second type of solution is the creation of a facility, or new institution to deal with the overhang of existing debt. The institution would buy the debt from the banks in exchange for claims on the institution, and in turn collect from the debtor countries. The prices at which debt is purchased, and the amounts to be collected from the debtors are the crucial issues. Finally, there are proposals for debt relief, either in direct negotiation between creditors and debtors and/or in conjunction with the creation of a facility. ...|$|R
40|$|The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) {{monitored}} NASA's {{activities and}} provided {{feedback to the}} NASA Administrator, other NASA officials and Congress throughout the year. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the Space Shuttle, its launch processing and planned and potential safety improvements. The Panel monitored Space Shuttle processing at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and will continue to follow it as personnel reductions are implemented. There is particular concern that upgrades in hardware, software, and operations with the potential for significant risk reduction not be overlooked due to the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>budget</b> pressures facing the agency. The authorization of all of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Block II components portends future Space Shuttle operations at lower risk levels and with greater margins for handling unplanned ascent events. Throughout the year, the Panel attempted to monitor the safety activities related to the Russian involvement in both space and aeronautics programs. This proved difficult as the working relationships between NASA and the Russians were still being defined as the year unfolded. NASA's concern for the unique safety problems inherent in a multi-national endeavor appears appropriate. Actions are underway or contemplated which should be capable of identifying and rectifying problem areas. The balance of this report presents 'Findings and Recommendations' (Section 2), 'Information in Support of Findings and Recommendations' (Section 3) and Appendices describing Panel membership, the NASA response to the March 1994 ASAP report, and a chronology of the panel's activities during the reporting period (Section 4) ...|$|E
40|$|If {{we think}} of large scale {{infrastructure}} projects in the Netherlands {{that have been developed}} recently we might {{come to the conclusion that}} the number of completed projects in terms of rail infrastructure is very limited. And if someone might ask to give a successful example of a railway line that has been developed last years it is hard to give a positive answer to this. We probably all know the ‘Betuwelijn’ or the recently completed ‘HSL’ (FYRA) (both connecting the Netherlands with its neighbouring countries), because of the issues around these projects; the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>budget</b> and their outranging costs in particular. It even might be argued that such projects have put large railway projects in a negative perspective. But also projects of smaller scale have been realized, at regional level: the ‘Randstadrail’ for example – a tramline that connects The Hague and Rotterdam. This project is probably more successful, partly because the line has been built together with its surroundings. Nevertheless, what these projects have in common is that they are defined by high complexity; for instance, they require participation of many different stakeholders and ask for integral planning approaches because these projects interact with their spatial and programmatic environment. The research of this master thesis draws on these constraints regarding integration of infrastructure planning and spatial development, and addresses the related issues of governance at regional level, between provincial and municipal administration - the ‘regional gap’. Both issues come together with projects in regional transport infrastructure. In order to understand the context of this ‘arena’ the thesis contains a survey on the system of spatial planning in the Netherlands, including the latest practices related to integrated transport planning. Secondly, in order to find potential and appropriate concepts that anticipate on these critical issues, various theories on integrated transport planning (e. g. nodal development or ‘transit oriented development’) and regional governance (e. g. institutional capacity building) are derived from literature research. As part of the empirical research, a regional transport infrastructure project has been taken as a case study: the ‘Rijn Gouwe Lijn’ (RGL) between Leiden and Gouda. In this case the critical issues regarding regional transport infrastructure are addressed and appropriate concepts from the theoretical study are applied. This thesis ends up with some final conclusions and recommendations for the case study area, from which the latter is translated in a proposal of three alternative design suggestions (a spatial concept together with a regional structure vision, an institutional framework and a planning strategy) in order to demonstrate the use of a design from a collaborative approach. Finally, some recommendations are done for future research. Complex CitiesUrbanismArchitectur...|$|E
