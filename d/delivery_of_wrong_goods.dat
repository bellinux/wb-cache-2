This study aimed to analyze the coding system used in a company of electronic technology, show key systems cited in the literature and propose alternate encoding for this organization. The methodology used was the literature research, combined with action research. After analysis, we proposed two alternatives: the first and simplest one yields results {{in the short term}} in order to solve the most problematic points; and the second one, using a completely different method, consumes more resources and time but solves all the identified problems. We concluded that modification is a process that yields short-term results but leaves some problems unresolved, while replacement, although a more complex implementation, is better in the long-term...|$|R

Applying Virtual Metrology (VM) techniques is one promising approach to reduce the time between process, measurement and corrective actions. Prior to implementation – besides technical aspects like testing – the investment into VM has to be assessed and justified {{on the basis of}} reliable and reasonable data. This paper presents the investment assessment for implementing VM algorithms into plasma etcher tools of a model semiconductor fabrication line. Core of the investment calculation is a spreadsheet-based calculation which allows for a results per quarter evaluation. A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model was developed to produce relevant input data for the spreadsheet calculation. Potential risks – e. g., <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrong</b> VM results – due to the implementation of VM have been identified and evaluated using the standardized method of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). ...|$|R

After that he begins helping the cooks with the event instead of attending as the newly appointed president. The company is floundering financially as new building contracts dry up. Under pressure Alex signs an unwise contract landing him in a situation to finish a building on a very tight deadline. A purchase order mix-up causes the building to be delayed due to the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrong</b> materials. Michelle Long, who is the head of purchasing at the Manhattan branch of Shelby's company, takes the fall for this delay. When Alex comes to Manhattan to works things out at the downtown office Michelle remembers him as the caterer from the banquet.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is mainly}} on Wole Soyinka as a dramatist.

Furthermore, the dissertation shows that although Soyinka is not an admirer of Marxist aesthetics, he is certainly not in the art-for-art's-sake camp either, I because he is fully aware of the utilitarian value of literature. Soyinka's works are much influenced by his social and historical background, and the dissertation shows that Soyinka's socio-political awareness pervades all these works, although it will be seen that in the later plays there is a sharpened political awareness. Although largely concerned with his own country's issues, Soyinka also emerges as a keen observer of humanity universallyEnglish StudiesM. A. (English...|$|R

Ethics are increasingly related to societal wants (framed {{in terms of social}} virtue), and less with traditional absolutes <b>of</b> right and <b>wrong,</b> <b>good</b> and evil. Previously, {{it could be argued that}} some questionable practices were overlooked and considered the consequence of increasing competition and the desire to remain in business, excused as human weaknesses. Theft, deception, extramarital affairs and embellished résumés have existed long before they became either news, or the necessarily the cause for termination or incarceration. Whether there are, in fact, more ethical lapses currently than previously is unknown. Technology has, however, made information readily accessible and immediate. Information availability along with increased regulatory restrictions and disclosure mandates place entrepreneurs and executives under a microscope of vulnerability. Ethical impropriety, whether in business of personal lives, causes observers to question the entrepreneur’s business judgement.|$|R

40|$|Questions <b>of</b> {{right and}} <b>wrong,</b> <b>good</b> and bad, lawful and unlawful, have been debated by philosophers, theologians, scholars, and {{ordinary}} people since ancient times. The moral domain represents humanity 2 ̆ 7 s answers to three questions: What {{is the right}} thing to do? How is the best state of affairs achieved? What qualities make for a good person? However, the scientific investigation of the moral life has a much shorter intellectual history than does philosophical and religious reflection; nevertheless, it is not new. Moral development theory and research emerged as a critical topic over 100 years ago, at the beginning of the 20 th century. Thus, given this deep background, it may surprise readers to learn that this is the very first time that the Nebraska Symposium on Motivation has served as a forum to reflect on what we know about moral development and motivation and to integrate theory and research with practical implications for schools, communities, and childrearing.

40|$|The {{value chain}} in any product system {{consists}} {{of all the}} processes {{from beginning to end}} of the production/distribution chain that create value for intermediate clients as well as the ultimate consumer. Any company’s offering (products and services) has economic worth {{only to the extent that}} buyers value that option compared to others in the market. As noted by Da Silva, Davies and Naude (2001), gaps between buyers and sellers on the relative value of competing offers are likely to exist in any commercial market. However, research on buyer and seller perceptions can provide a closer match between seller offerings and buyer expectations and therefore a more efficient and competitive exchange system. The objective of this project is to measure buyer and seller perceptions of value of competing purchase options with the goal of developing a value chain model for the textiles complex. To obtain additional information about the retail environment component of the value chain, beyond the research on apparel purchases patterns already completed, a study of retail buyers was conducted. Quality, cost, and good design ideas were found to be the top three criteria used in deciding to purchase apparel from a new supplier. These three were rated as significantly more important than the other five, including delivery time. On the other hand, the most frequently mentioned problem with domestic suppliers of apparel was unsatisfactory delivery, including late <b>delivery</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wrong</b> product.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a simple {{model of the}} ethical choice problem in business. The model incorporates insights from the literatures of ethics, psychology, economics, and business ethics. It suggests several interesting hypotheses regarding the level of ethics {{which is likely to}} be observed in a competitive capitalist economy, and the level to be desired. Business ethics is an important subject. It is important to individuals acting in their economic roles because living up to one's ethical ideals is an important dimension of one's self image. It is important in terms of the survival potential of an economic system because, as Schumpeter suggested many years ago, an economic system that is perceived as morally wrong, is doomed to ultimate demise [21]. The article is divided into six sections. The first covers definitional matters. The second identifies the key insights from the relevant literatures. The third discusses the phenomena to be incorporated into the model. The fourth presents the model. The fifth deduces several static conclusions from the model. And the sixth section raises an interesting dynamic issue. I. DEFINITIONAL MATTERS Ethics is both a scholarly discipline and a practical aspect of human existence. For scholars, ethics is the study of human behavior in terms of the basic issues <b>of</b> right or <b>wrong,</b> <b>good</b> or bad. For individuals busy living their daily lives, ethics is a matter of choosing and trying to practice a code of conduct.
