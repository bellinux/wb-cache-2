The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need <b>for</b> <b>complex</b> mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{idea that}} the {{assembly}} of protein complexes is linked with protein disorder has been inferred from a few large complexes, such as the viral capsid or bacterial flagellar system, only. The relationship, which suggests that larger complexes have more disorder, has never been systematically tested. The recent high-throughput analyses of protein-protein interactions and protein complexes in the cell generated data that enable {{to address this issue}} by bioinformatic means. Results In this work we predicted structural disorder for both E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and correlated it with the size of complexes. Using IUPred to predict the disorder <b>for</b> each <b>complex,</b> we found a statistically significant correlation between disorder and the number of proteins assembled into complexes. The distribution of disorder has a median value of 10 % in yeast <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of 2 – 4 components (6 % in E. coli), but 18 % <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> in the size range of 11 – 100 proteins (12 % in E. coli). The level of disorder as assessed for regions longer than 30 consecutive disordered residues shows an even stronger division between small and large complexes (median values about 4 % <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of 2 – 4 components, but 12 % <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of 11 – 100 components in yeast). The predicted correlation is also supported by experimental evidence, by observing the structural disorder in protein components of complexes that {{can be found in the}} Protein Data Bank (median values 1. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of 2 – 4 components, and 9. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of 11 – 100 components in yeast). Further analysis shows that this correlation is not directly linked with the increased disorder in hub proteins, but reflects a genuine systemic property of the proteins that make up the complexes. Conclusion Overall, it is suggested and discussed that the assembly of protein-protein complexes is enabled and probably promoted by protein disorder. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{projective}} {{dimension of}} Cartan and Eilenberg and the Gorenstein dimension of Auslander and Bridger are two classical homological dimensions {{for the class}} of finite modules over commutative noetherian local rings. Recently, new homological dimensions have been defined: complete intersection dimension by Avramov, Gasharov and Peeva, Cohen-Macaulay dimension and lower complete intersection dimension by Gerko. This thesis focuses on Gorenstein dimensions for modules and <b>for</b> <b>complexes.</b> ^ In Chapter 1, we introduce and study a new homological dimension called upper Gorenstein dimension. It is modeled on the complete intersection dimension and has parallel properties. We show that this new dimension sits between Gorenstein dimension and complete intersection dimension and if one of these dimensions is finite, then it is equal to those to its left. ^ We also construct families of modules for which strict inequality is obtained between various homological dimensions. By finding a module for which lower complete intersection dimension is strictly less than the complete intersection dimension, we answer a question of Gerko. ^ In Chapter 2, we introduce and study a notion of Gorenstein projective dimension <b>for</b> arbitrary <b>complexes</b> of left modules over an associative ring. It specializes to Gorenstein projective dimension of Enochs and Jenda for left modules over an associative ring and to the Gorenstein projective dimension of Christensen <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> with bounded below homology. Gorenstein projective dimension <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> is less or equal to the projective dimension <b>for</b> <b>complexes,</b> notion defined by Avramov and Foxby. When the latter dimension is finite, equality is attained. These two dimensions have parallel properties. ^ We also introduce and study a Tate cohomology theory <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> of finite Gorenstein projective dimension. It specializes to existing cohomological theories, due to Tate, Farrell, Buchweitz, Avramov, Martsinkovsky and others. We show that Tate cohomology <b>for</b> <b>complexes</b> has most formal properties of earlier cohomologies of modules, in particular it admits a natural transformation to classical Ext groups. In the case of module arguments, we show that these maps fit into a long exact sequence, where every third term is a relative cohomology group defined for left modules of finite Gorenstein projective dimension. ...|$|R
