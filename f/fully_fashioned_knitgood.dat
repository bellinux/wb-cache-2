5000|$|Full Fashioned: <b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{stockings}} are knitted flat, {{the material}} is then cut and {{the two sides are}} then united by a seam up the back. <b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> stockings were the most popular style until the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Complete garment {{knitting}} is a next-generation form of <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> knitting {{that adds}} {{the capability of}} making a 3-dimensional full garment. Unlike other <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> knitting, where the shaped pieces must still be sewn together, finished complete knitted garments do not have seams. The knitting machines' computerized instructions direct movement of hundreds of needles to construct and connect several tubular knitted forms to create a complete garment in a single production step.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{knitting}} machines are those flat and circular {{knitting machines}} that produce custom pre-shaped pieces of a knitted garment. Instead of knitting a whole rectangular sheet of fabric, instructions from a knit pattern on a punch card or computer file guide a <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> knitting machine's needles to add or drop stitches to create custom two-dimensional shapes appropriate to the desired finished garment structure. The pieces emerge from the machine ready to be sewn together.|$|R
50|$|Garment dyeing is {{the process}} of dyeing <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{garments}} subsequent to manufacturing, as opposed to the conventional method of manufacturing garments from pre-dyed fabrics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{knitting}} {{cuts down}} {{on the amount of}} material required to make a garment by eliminating selvage, the remnants that would be left after cutting from a rectangular fabric sheet. For example, a sweater requires at least four pieces of fabric: two sleeves, the front piece, and the back piece. Prior to <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> machine techniques, a full sheet of material would have to be produced, each of the four pieces would be cut out, and the remaining fabric would be discarded. With full-fashioning, the machine produces only the four required pieces.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{stockings}} are sized to {{the height}} and shoe size (generally) of the wearer {{and as such}} {{have little or no}} stretch in them as they have no lycra (spandex) contained within the yarn.|$|R
50|$|Complete garment {{knitting}} requires two needle {{beds for}} three-dimensional structures (such as clothing).

50|$|Such fetishists {{may also}} be divided into many sub-categories {{relative}} to their attraction to certain types of stockings.

50|$|These knit options above {{may also}} be used to change the {{structure}} of each piece to create limited curvature (such as convexity at the bust of a sweater) in the relatively two-dimensional output. A new generation of <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> machines, called complete garment knitting machines, output seamless three-dimensional garments by knitting connected tubular forms.|$|R

40|$|Knit on Demand is a {{research}} project at the Swedish School of Textiles in collaboration with Ivanhoe AB and SOMconcept AB. The purpose of the project is to test new production methods for knitwear that could strongly influence the fashion industry's need for agility. In autumn 2009 sales started in Stockholm. The project stands on three legs; design, knitting technology and logistics {{and the purpose of}} the paper is to describe the Knit on Demand project from these three perspectives. Designing the garments and the system was the most time consuming part of the project since the products had to be fashionable, manufacturable and preferably not to expensive so a few trade offs hade to be made. Look was however considered essential since fashion always comes first. For knitting a combination of <b>fully</b> <b>fashion</b> and cut and sew are used so that the garments keep some of the <b>fully</b> <b>fashion</b> advantages but remains easily customisable. Logistics becomes a little bit more complicated because of the unique garments but the logistic costs does still not make up more than 3 - 5 percent of the sales price of a garment. Return rates are below one percent, which is rather interesting to further analysis...|$|R

Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines.

Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.|$|R
