This report is related to <b>electrical</b> <b>actuators</b> and self-locking problem, which is really common in them. The thesis report has been performed at Reac AB in Åmål, Sweden, a major supplier of wheel chair <b>actuators.</b>   <b>Electrical</b> <b>actuators</b> have vast usage and they are versatile but in some cases they face with different working situation like dynamic forces. Recent generation of <b>electrical</b> <b>actuators</b> which used in wheelchairs (imagine moving wheelchair in bumpy road) have self-locking problem, which it means that they will lose their position after while under compression load. This fact will lead to de-calibration of the control system. Approximately 90 % of  AB production is related to the electrical wheelchairs. Challenging point here is dynamic force which can lead to de-calibration of potentiometer and failure of device.   Load capacity of certain actuator (RE 25) is 2000 N.

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>actuator</b> {{systems are}} being pursued as {{alternatives}} to hydraulic systems to reduce maintenance time, weight and costs while increasing reliability. Additionally, safety and environmental hazards {{associated with the}} hydraulic fluids can be eliminated. For most actuation systems, the actuation process is typically pulsed with high peak power requirements but with relatively modest average power levels. The power-time requirements for electrical actuators are characteristic of pulsed power technologies where the source can be sized for the average power levels while providing the capability to achieve the peak requirements. Among the options for the power source are battery systems, capacitor systems or battery-capacitor hybrid systems. Battery technologies are energy dense but deficient in power density; capacitor technologies are power dense but limited by energy density. The battery-capacitor hybrid system uses the battery to supply the average power and the capacitor to meet the peak demands. It has been demonstrated in previous work that the hybrid electrical power source can potentially provide a weight savings of approximately 59 % over a battery-only source. Electrochemical capacitors have many properties that make them well-suited for <b>electrical</b> <b>actuator</b> applications. They have the highest demonstrated energy density for capacitive storage (up to 100 J/g), have power densities much greater than most battery technologies (greater than 30 kW/kg), are capable of greater than one million charge-discharge cycles, can be charged at extremely high rates, and have non-explosive failure modes. Thus, electrochemical capacitors exhibit a combination of desirable battery and capacitor characteristics...|$|E

The Inria project-team Non-A is focusing on designing such "non-asymptotic" algorithms: there, mathematics (algebra, homogeneity) are combined with real-time applications (robotics, energy, environment) … For engineers, a wide variety of information is not directly obtained through measurement. Some parameters (constants of an <b>electrical</b> <b>actuator,</b> time delay in communication, etc.) or internal variables (torques applied to a robot arm, posture and localization of a mobile, detection of impact of angles in biped walk, etc.) are unknown or are not measured. Similarly, more often than not, signals from sensors are distorted and tainted by measurement noises. To control such processes, and to extract information conveyed by the signals, one often has to estimate parameters or variables. Estimation can concern parameters (identification), states (observation), derivatives (differentiation), inputs (left inversion) or noisy data (filtering). It means a nearly infinite number of results have already been produced in this area, concerning either control or signal processing… However, unlike traditional methods, the majority of which pertain to asymptotic statistics, the particularity of Non-A is to develop algorithms which converge after a finite-time.
