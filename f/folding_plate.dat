60|$|These barbarous stories carried me, {{sitting there}} on the Holly-Tree hearth, to the Roadside Inn, renowned in my time in a sixpenny book with a <b>folding</b> <b>plate,</b> {{representing}} in a central compartment of oval form the portrait of Jonathan Bradford, and in four corner compartments four incidents of the tragedy with which the name is associated,--coloured with a hand at once so free and economical, that the bloom of Jonathan's complexion passed without any pause into the breeches of the ostler, and, smearing itself off into the next division, became rum in a bottle. Then I remembered how the landlord was found at the murdered traveller's bedside, with his own knife at his feet, and blood upon his hand; how he was hanged for the murder, notwithstanding his protestation that he had indeed come there to kill the traveller for his saddle-bags, but had been stricken motionless on finding him already slain; and how the ostler, years afterwards, owned the deed. By this time I had made myself quite uncomfortable. I stirred the fire, and stood with my back to {{it as long as}} I could bear the heat, looking up at the darkness beyond the screen, and at the wormy curtains creeping in and creeping out, like the worms in the ballad of Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogene.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{diagnostics}} {{and virtual}} imaging of damages in complex structures like <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> {{can help reduce}} the inspection time for guided wave based NDE and integrated SHM. <b>Folded</b> <b>plate</b> or box structure {{is one of the}} major structural components for increasing the structural strength. Damage in the <b>folded</b> <b>plate,</b> mostly in the form of surface breaking cracks in the inaccessible zone is a usual problem in aerospace structures. One side of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> is attached (either riveted or bonded) to adjacent structure which is not accessible for immediate inspection. The sensor-actuator network in the form of a circular array is placed on the accessible side of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate.</b> In the present work, a circular array is employed for scanning the entire <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> type structure for damage diagnosis and wave field visualization of entire structural panel. The method employs guided wave with relatively low frequency bandwidth of 100 - 300 kHz. Change in the response signal with respect to a baseline signal is used to construct a quantitative relationship with damage size parameters. Detecting damage in the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> by using this technique has significant potential for off-line and on-line SHM technologies. By employing this technique, surface breaking cracks on inaccessible face of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> are detected without disassembly of structure in a realistic environment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A nine noded {{flat plate}} element, {{considering}} first order transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia with five {{degrees of freedom}} per node, is used to compute element stiffness and mass matrices for composite plates. Drilling degrees of freedom are introduced to account for three translations and three rotations per node, and transformed to obtain the global matrices for computing the dynamic response of stiffened laminated composite and sandwich <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structures. The stiffeners are visualized as parts of the <b>folded</b> <b>plate.</b> The formulation works well. New results for stiffened <b>folded</b> <b>plates</b> are reported with different arrangements of stiffeners to observe their effects.

5000|$|The Tenax II is a 35mm RF-camera {{launched}} by ZI in 1938. It produces 50 square exposures {{on a standard}} length of 35mm film. It has a Compur Rapid shutter, situated just behind the lens, with speeds from 1 to 1/400 second. The camera is wound and the film advanced simultaneously depressing the large lever {{on the right-hand side}} of the lens. At first it was only called the Tenax, but the following year a quite different and less sophisticated camera with the same name was launched, both designed by Hubert Nerwin, supposedly based on Otto Berning's original idea. The 1938 model is known as mark II, or just the Tenax II, while the simpler 1939 model, is known as the Tenax I. The [...] "Tenax" [...] name belonged to the C. P.

40|$|An element-free Galerkin {{method for}} the {{solution}} of free vibration of symmetrically laminated <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structures is introduced. Employing the mature meshfree <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> model proposed by the author, a <b>folded</b> laminated <b>plate</b> is simulated as a composite structure of symmetric laminates that lie in different planes. Based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the moving least-squares (MLS) approximation, the stiffness and mass matrices of the laminates are derived and supposed to obtain the stiffness and mass matrices of the entire <b>folded</b> laminated <b>plate.</b> The equation governing the free vibration behaviors of the <b>folded</b> laminated <b>plate</b> is thus established. Because of the meshfree characteristics of the proposed method, no mesh is involved to determine the stiffness and mass matrices of the laminates. Therefore, the troublesome remeshing can be avoided completely {{from the study of}} such problems as the large deformation of <b>folded</b> laminated <b>plates.</b> The calculation of several numerical examples shows that the solutions given by the proposed method are very close to those given by ANSYS, using shell elements, which proves the validity of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|General {{strategy}} for developing finite elements of general geometric shape explained on quadrilateral <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structure element ensuring invariance properties {{is presented in}} this paper. The basic idea of this strategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the element geometry and performing the element integration in a mapped biunit square. For defining the approximation functions a suitable local Cartesian coordinate system defined from the directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular contravariant base vectors is used. The origin of the local coordinate system {{is located at the}} element centroid (centre of gravity). Hybrid and boundary finite elements of reduced Trefftz type for analysing the <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structures are also presented. The <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structure element is a combination of a plate bending element and a plane stress element. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{conventional}} semi-analytical finite strip analysis of <b>folded</b> <b>plates,</b> the boundary {{conditions and the}} intermediate support conditions must be satisfied a priori. The admissible functions used as the longitudinal part of the displacement functions are sometimes difficult to find, and they are valid for specific conditions only. In this paper, a general finite strip is developed for the static and vibration analyses of <b>folded</b> <b>plate</b> structures. The geometric constraints of the <b>folded</b> <b>plates,</b> such as the conditions {{at the end and}} intermediate supports, are modelled by very stiff translational and rotational springs as appropriate. The complete Fourier series including the constant term are chosen as the longitudinal approximating functions for each of the displacements. As these displacement functions are more general in nature and independent of one another, they are capable of giving more accurate solutions. The potential problem of ill-conditioned matrices is investigated and the appropriate choice of the very stiff springs is also suggested. The formulation is done in such a way to obtain a unified approach, taking full advantage of the power of modern computers. A few numerical examples are presented for comparison with numerical results from published solutions or solutions obtained from the finite element method. The results show that this kind of strips is versatile, efficient and accurate for the static and vibration analyses of <b>folded</b> <b>plates.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
