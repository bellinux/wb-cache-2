She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

500|$|The novel Miracle at St. Anna {{was written}} by James McBride [...] {{originating}} from his late uncle's experiences as a World War II soldier. [...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I studied the whole business of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired." [...] The 92nd Division served as the basis for McBride's novel, which was published in 2003.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Wrecking Crew" [...] was {{popularized by}} drummer and member Hal Blaine in his 1990 memoir, Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew. [...] Though the unit {{did not have}} an {{official}} moniker during their years of activity, Blaine has stated that the term was sometimes used disparagingly in the early 1960s by members of the industry's old guard of [...] "coat and tie" [...] session players, who felt that, with their penchant for wearing [...] "t-shirts and jeans" [...] to sessions and their embrace of rock and roll, they were going to [...] "wreck" [...] the music industry. [...] According to biographer Kent Hartman, [...] "Some of the studio musicians <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> swear they heard it applied to themselves as early as 1963; others say it was later. [...] One says it was never used at all". [...] Blaine's memoirs, and the attention that followed, cast new light on the Wrecking Crew's role in many famous recordings.|$|E

2500|$|Huston's parents {{divorced}} in 1913, {{when he was}} 6, {{and as a result}} much of his childhood was spent living in boarding schools. During summer vacations, he traveled with each of his parents separately— with his father on vaudeville tours, and with his mother to racetracks or other sports events. The young Huston benefited greatly from seeing his father act on stage, as he was later drawn to the world of acting. Some critics, such as Lawrence Grobel, surmise that his relationship with his mother may have been the cause of his five marriages, and why few of his relationships lasted. Grobel wrote, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> some of the women who had loved him, they inevitably referred to his mother as the key to unlocking Huston's psyche." [...] According to actress Olivia de Havilland, [...] "she [...] was the central character. I always felt that John was ridden by witches. He seemed pursued by something destructive. If it wasn't his mother, it was his idea of his mother." ...|$|E

From a queer theoretical perspective I examine how these girls do and talk about their relationships, in relation to norms about relationships and sexuality as well as notions about online and offline. My aim is to discuss in which ways the performing of these relationships both reproduce and challenge norms about relationships and sexuality. The girls <b>I</b> <b>interview</b> attempt in different ways to show that doing relationships online is just as ”normal” as doing them offline. While normative assumptions about components such as monogamy and love as being vital to a relationship often are reproduced in the performing of these relationships, I assert that {{the ways in which}} these relationships are done hold a subversive potential to challenge normative understandings of concepts such as relationship, sexuality, sex, physicality and closeness. ...|$|R
