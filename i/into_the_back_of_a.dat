5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it {{until the end of}} {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E

5|$|Brodie {{was named}} as York's Players' Player of the Year for the season, {{as well as}} being awarded the Keith Walwyn Golden Boot, having scored 32 goals at that point. York {{finished}} fifth in the Conference Premier, and Brodie was the division's joint top scorer alongside Matt Tubbs with 26 goals. He scored the winning goal on 89 minutes to give York a 1–0 home victory against Luton in the play-off semi-final first leg. He played in the 1–0 away victory in the second leg, meaning York won the tie 2–0 on aggregate. After the match, Brodie was hit by a coin, with the squad being forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stand after missiles were thrown at them by a section of Luton fans. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May 2010, in which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and 34 goals, making him York's highest goalscorer in a season since Bottom scored 39 in 1954–55. York entered negotiations over a new contract with Brodie {{after the end of the}} season. At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named the Conference Premier Player of the Year and a member of the Team of the Year.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to smaller circuits, road racing drivers {{rely heavily on}} the use of flags. As it is impractical to have spotters covering all segments of a winding race track, the first indication to drivers of local hazards almost always comes from marshals stationed at various flag stations around the course. Missing or disregarding a flag can have critical consequences, as Mario and Michael Andretti discovered during a 1991 CART race in Detroit, Michigan. Michael came around a blind corner at high speed, without heeding the yellow flag being displayed—and plowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> CART safety truck tending to another disabled car. Fifteen seconds later, his father Mario disregarded the same madly waving yellows and crashed into the car the safety vehicle was trying to assist.|$|E

Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for re-election over a term of seven years on December 23, 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power.

25|$|Lori Lee Kursa, 13, a Lawrence Cook Middle School student, {{had been}} {{reported}} missing by her mother on November 11, 1972 after disappearing while they shopped at a U-Save and was last seen on November 20 or 21 in Santa Rosa while visiting friends, having deliberately run away. She had been known to hitchhike occasionally. Her frozen remains were located on December 14 in a ravine approximately fifty feet off Calistoga Road, northeast of Rincon Valley in Santa Rosa. The killer had thrown the body at least thirty feet over an embankment. The cause of her death was a broken neck with compression and hemorrhage of the spinal cord. The victim had not been raped and likely died one to two weeks prior to discovery. A possible witness to her abduction later came forward stating that on an evening somewhere between December 3 and 9, while on Parkhurst Drive he saw two men push a girl fitting Kursa's description <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> van driven by a Caucasian man with an Afro-type hairstyle.

25|$|At Florence and Halldale, two {{officers}} issued {{a plea for}} assistance in apprehending a young suspect who had thrown an object at their car and whom they were now pursuing on foot. Approximately two dozen officers, commanded by 77th Street Division LAPD officer Lieutenant Michael Moulin, arrived and arrested the youth, 16-year old Seandel Daniels, forcing him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car. The rough handling of the young man, a minor who was {{well known in the}} community, further agitated an uneasy and growing crowd, who began taunting and berating the police. Among them was Bart Bartholemew (who was later attacked and had his driver side window broken), a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and Timothy Goldman, who began to record events with a camcorder over the next two hours. The police formed a perimeter around the arresting officers as the crowd grew more hostile, leading to further altercations and arrests (including that of Damian Williams' older brother, Mark Jackson). Fearing police would resort to deadly force to repel the growing crowd, Lieutenant Moulin ordered officers out of the area altogether. Moulin later said that officers on the scene were outnumbered and unprepared to handle the situation because their riot equipment was stored at the police academy.|$|E
