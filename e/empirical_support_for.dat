25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence is all the more impressive when one considers that most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no corrective feedback is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Relational ties principle: The fusion {{approach}} {{assumes that}} strongly fused persons care {{not only about}} their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) {{with other members of}} the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom they may have had little or no contact. Several studies have garnered <b>empirical</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).|$|E

His experiment involved lupin seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually unclean meat inhibited the seedling's growth more than that from ritually clean meats. At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar Lester L.

Also, survey asked about students’ perception on their peers’ feedback in terms of frequency and effectiveness. The results indicated that learners hardly provided feedback in response to their peer’s erroneous utterance in a natural instructional setting. As a result, they also rarely had a chance to uptake in response to the feedback. However, they showed quite positive attitudes toward the peer feedback and their uptake following it. The study has pedagogical implication that adequate selection of task types has significant importance for facilitating meaningful negotiation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} under certain {{conditions}} a firm's decision concerning the optimal medium of exchange to use in acquiring another firm {{is related to the}} decision of which source of capital should be used to finance long-term projects. An example of this type of interaction occurs when the firm's only source of financing a positive net present value project is an equity issue. In a Myers and Majluf (1984) world of asymmetric information the value maximizing strategy for the firm is to forego the public equity offering and instead use a stock offer to acquire a firm possessing financial slack. The process is modeled using an extension of the Myers and Majluf (1984) model and demonstrates how the acquisition alternative allows managers to separate the signals regarding the investment and financing decisions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{evaluates the}} use of the nonparametric kernel method for testing {{specification}} of diffusion models as originally considered in Aït-Sahalia (1996). A serious doubt on the ability of the kernel method for diffusion model testing has been cast in Pritsker (1998), who observes severe size distortion of the test proposed by Aït-Sahalia and finds that 2755 years of data are required in order for the kernel density estimator to attain a level of accuracy achieved with 22 years of independent data. We introduce in this paper a set of additional measures to the kernel method and show that the severe size distortion observed by Pritsker (1998) can be overcome by implementing these measures. Our simulation for both the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross diffusion models indicates that the proposed test has reasonable size and power under various degrees of data persistence for as little as 10 years of data.
