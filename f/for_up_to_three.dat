Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local bunkers, and civil defence drills were held at least twice a month, lasting <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> days, in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued with rifles (but no ammunition).|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, to be used <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E

5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E

5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. <b>For</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E

5|$|Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is {{an offence}} to make, publish or {{circulate}} any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or {{which is likely to}} incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed if the person who made, published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true, and did not intend to incite one community against another.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other {{mushrooms}} {{known to}} release spores {{in response to}} a circadian rhythm, spore release in M.rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E
5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} that any potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, before giving a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to be overwhelming to players.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E

5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E

5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on {{seeds in the}} winter and insects in the spring and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
