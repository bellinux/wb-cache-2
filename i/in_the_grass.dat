40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that vegetation has a stabilization {{effect on a}} slope; however, very limited quantitative field data are available for verifying this perception. In order to improve our understanding on the vegetation effect on rainfall infiltration and hence on slope stability, a well-instrumented field study was carried out on an unsaturated expansive soil slope <b>in</b> China. <b>The</b> field program consisted of two neighboring monitoring areas (both 16 m wide by about 30 m long) : namely a bare area and a naturally grassed area (real slope). Artificial rainfall events were produced <b>in</b> succession <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two areas with a specially-designed sprinkler system. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> relevant monitored results from the two areas are directly compared and discussed. Prior to the artificial rainfall, the measured higher initial soil suction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> area than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bare areas was attributed to the evapo-transpiration effect of <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> During <b>the</b> rainfall, the presence of <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> greatly increased <b>the</b> infiltrability of the upper soil layer and delayed the onset of surface runoff. The observed delayed responses (i. e., about 3 days) of surface runoff, soil suction and water content to <b>the</b> rainfall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> area was about twice the duration of <b>the</b> delayed response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bare area (i. e., about 1. 5 days). The influence of the simulated rainfall on the changes of soil suction and water content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> area {{was found to be}} more significant and about 1. 5 m deeper than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bare area. The greater depth of influence observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> area may be attributable to the greater depth of open cracks due to the evapo-transpiration effect of grass...|$|R

A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis Drive to Green Lane and the reconstruction of Green Lane into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot is {{a predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns. Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E

5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E

They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E
50|$|Mahón's {{sweet and}} fruity {{but at times}} {{slightly}} salty taste is due <b>in</b> part to <b>the</b> sea salt content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> <b>the</b> cows eat.

5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, the winged form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.|$|E
