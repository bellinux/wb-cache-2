5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of <b>hunger,</b> <b>and</b> huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E

Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Littell {{decided to}} {{quit his job}} at Action Against <b>Hunger</b> <b>and</b> started {{research}} which lasted 18 months, during which he went to Germany, Ukraine, Russia and Poland, and read around 200 books, mainly about Nazi Germany, the Eastern Front, the Nuremberg Trials, and the genocide process. In addition, the author studied the literature and film archives of World War II and the post-war trials. Littell worked on this novel for about five years. This book is his first novel written in French and his second novel after the science fiction themed Bad Voltage in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Kalasutra (thread of Time/Death): The Bhagavata Purana assigns this hell to {{a murderer}} of a brahmin (the Hindu priestly caste), while the Devi Bhagavata Purana allocates {{it for a}} person who disrespects his parents, elders, {{ancestors}} or brahmins. This realm is made entirely of copper and extremely hot, heated by fire from below and the red hot sun from above. Here, the sinner burns from within by <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> thirst and the smouldering heat outside, whether he sleeps, sits, stands or runs.|$|E
5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with <b>hunger,</b> <b>and</b> Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the only option was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told to wave a white flag at the militia.|$|E

Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning their {{confidence}} and then killing them with sharp tridents or lances. The bodies of such sinners, fatigued with <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> thirst, are pierced with sharp, needle-like spears.

5|$|The wars {{had caused}} {{widespread}} devastation and famine, {{and one of}} the victims of the <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.|$|E

Banza's mistress, Julienne Kombo, who entered the Palais de la Renaissance crying hysterically after her lover's death, was arrested and jailed until 24 June 1972. Banza's father was sent to jail, where he died of <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion on 24 April 1970 at Ngaragba Central Prison. Banza's two younger brothers, Beuoane and Gouboulo, were dismissed from the gendarmerie in July and sent to Ngaragba Prison.

5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

She visited Indian jawans (troops) in Rajasthan, for a special Holi weekend episode of NDTV's reality show Jai Jawaan. In 2010, Kapoor adopted the village of Chanderi in Madhya Pradesh as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. Four years later, she participated in a campaign to raise awareness on <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> malnutrition in the world and made donations to the Kashmir flood relief.

5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the {{fighting}} ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived from Ilolo to take command.

On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over command of Maroubra Force and further reinforcements arrived as first the 2/14th, 2/16th and later the 2/27th Battalions from the 7th Division's 21st Brigade also reached the area. Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue was becoming a serious problem for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived were also {{in a state of}} disarray having been committed to the battle in a piecemeal fashion and suffering badly from <b>hunger</b> <b>and</b> disease.|$|E
