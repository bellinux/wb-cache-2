5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E

5000|$|Each terminal, RT, BC, or BM, is {{connected}} to the bus through a stub, formed of a length of cable of the same type as the bus itself. MIL-STD-1553B defines two ways of coupling these stubs to the bus: transformer <b>coupled</b> stubs and <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs. Transformer coupled stubs are preferred for their fault tolerance and better matching to the impedance of the bus, and consequent reduction in reflections, etc. The appendix to MIL-STD-1553B (in section 10.5, Stubbing) states [...] "The preferred method of stubbing is to use transformer coupled stubs… This method provides the benefits of DC isolation, increased common mode rejection, a doubling of effective stub impedance, and fault isolation for the entire stub and terminal. <b>Direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs… should be avoided if at all possible. <b>Direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs provide no DC isolation or common mode rejection for the terminal external to its subsystem. Further, any shorting fault between the subsystems sic internal isolation resistors (usually on a circuit board) and the main bus junction will cause failure of that entire bus. It can be expected that when the <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stub length exceeds 1.6 feet meters, that it will begin to distort the main bus waveforms." ...|$|R
50|$|In <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> OTL designs, {{both the}} {{necessary}} blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and {{the selection of}} vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker. Typically, <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> OTL amplifiers will have a user-adjustable DC offset control, which allows the user to trim off any residual DC voltage residing at the amplifier's output terminals prior to operation. Servo-controlled variants also exist.|$|R
25|$|A severe {{problem of}} phonetic or {{sensorimotor}} models of speech processing (like DIVA or ACT) {{is that the}} development of the phonemic map during speech acquisition is not modeled. A possible solution of this problem could be a <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> of action repository and mental lexicon without explicitly introducing a phonemic map at the beginning of speech acquisition (even at the beginning of imitation training; see Kröger et al. 2011 PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics).|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} active transport, {{also known}} as coupled transport or co-transport, energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary active transport, there is no <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> of ATP; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell. Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and {{can serve as a}} source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase).|$|E
25|$|Direct coupled amplifier, using no {{impedance}} and bias matching components: This {{class of}} amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube {{days when the}} anode (output) voltage was at greater than several hundred volts and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible. In FET and CMOS technologies <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> is dominant since gates of MOSFETs theoretically pass no current through themselves. Therefore, DC component of the input signals is automatically filtered.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> designs, capacitively coupled designs {{rely on the}} {{selection}} of tube types with a sufficiently low impedance to effect the transfer of power to the loudspeaker. However, unlike <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> designs, capacitively coupled designs do not have inherent DC blocking {{by virtue of their}} topology. Instead, DC voltage in the output section is blocked by an output coupling capacitor - typically a large-value (3000-6000μF) electrolytic capacitor - which is interposed between the amplifier's output section and the loudspeaker.|$|R

25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of proton translocation and electron transport in Complex I {{is currently}} proposed as being indirect (long range conformational changes) {{as opposed to}} direct (redox intermediates in the hydrogen pumps as in heme groups of Complexes III and IV). The architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I shows multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. The three central components believed to contribute to this long-range conformational change event are the pH-coupled N2 iron-sulfur cluster, the quinone reduction, and the transmembrane helix subunits of the membrane arm. Transduction of conformational changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a 'connecting rod' during the reduction of ubiquinone can account {{for two or three}} of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton must be pumped by <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> at the ubiquinone-binding site. It is proposed that direct and indirect coupling mechanisms account for the pumping of the four protons.|$|E
