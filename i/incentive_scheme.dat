40|$|This paper first studies how cost padding, {{auditing}} and collusion with auditors {{affect the}} power of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in procurement and regulation. Unaudited cost padding requires fixed price contracts. <b>Incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> are more powerful under imperfect auditing than under perfect auditing and less powerful than under no auditing. The effect of collusion in auditing on the optimal power of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> is ambiguous; high-powered <b>schemes</b> reduce the <b>incentive</b> for cost padding and thus are less affected by collusion; however, they also yield higher rents and therefore make firms more willing to prevent release of evidence of cost padding. Monitoring of effort, the second topic of this paper, is {{a substitute for the}} use of low-powered <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> to extract the informational rents. It thus enables the regulator to afford more powerful <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> Collusion in auditing unambiguously lowers {{the power of}} <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> act as {{external}} stimuli. They induce {{workers to}} excel and {{earn more than}} the normal wages. Therefore, well-drafted <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> bring gains to all, i. e., both to the employers and employees. These schemes have universal application, {{in the sense that}} they can be applied in all forms of business organizations, be it big or small, high-tech or labour-intensive, etc., though the structure and complexities of the schemes may vary from a small enterprise to a big enterprise. The present research paper aims to evaluate the labour incentive plans of SSI sector in a selected area. The SSI units are labour-intensive and provide gainful employment to lakhs of low-educated, unskilled and semi-skilled workers. The operational efficiency of these units depend on the efficiency rate of their employees. In view of this, <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> become essential. The study looks at the existence, structure and cost of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in Hubli-Dharwad area of Karnataka State. The study finds that <b>incentives</b> <b>schemes</b> are yet to make serious inroads into SSI sector and only 68 percent of surveyed units employ them. The schemes employed are simple, monetary and individual-oriented in nature. The cost of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> does not exceed 5 percent of total labour cost in majority of units employing such schemes. The study also finds that there is no statistical relationship between educational qualification level of entrepreneurs and the adoption of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> but the educational level becomes important in deciding the structure of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes.</b> The study concludes by providing some useful suggestions for the adoption and operation of <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> in SSI sector...|$|R

A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E

It reviews the experiences of the central government introducing incentives for reform directly through various specific purpose transfers as well as the <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> recommended by various Finance Commissions. The <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> directly introduced by the central government include, accelerated irrigation benefit programme, accelerated power development and reform programme, Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission, education and health sector reforms. The reforms recommended by the Finance Commissions include incentivising tax reforms and fiscal restructuring and consolidation. The review of the experiences of Indian fiscal federalism shows that the incentivising reforms have neither been an unqualified success nor have they been a total failure. There are interesting lessons to be learnt from the experiences for both designing the <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> and implementing them. The paper summarises the lessons of experience. While incorporating these in designing and implementing <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> can be useful in the short and medium term, what matters in the long run is the political incentive for reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of share <b>incentive</b> <b>schemes</b> {{as part of}} the {{remuneration}} structure for the head of internal audit or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) is one mechanism available to a company to incentivise its senior executives and to ensure they add value to the company they manage. This can however lead to challenges as internal auditors have always had to fulfil two contradictory roles: being an employee in a company and being an objective person involved in rendering independent assurance services for the same company. It is, therefore, important for internal auditors to strike the correct balance that ensures they are perceived as sufficiently independent to achieve their objectives in terms of the annual internal audit plan. Care must also be taken to ensure that the share incentives do not have a negative influence on the level (or perceived level) of independence and objectivity the CAE demonstrates.
