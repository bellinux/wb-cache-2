40|$|AbstractLung {{health and}} normal mucus {{clearance}} depend on adequate hydration of airway surfaces. Because transepithelial osmotic gradients drive water flows, sufficient hydration of the airway surface liquid {{depends on a}} balance between ion secretion and absorption by respiratory epithelia. In vitro experiments using cultures of primary human nasal epithelia and human bronchial epithelia have established many of the biophysical processes involved in airway surface liquid homeostasis. Most experimental studies, however, {{have focused on the}} apical membrane, despite the fact that ion transport across respiratory epithelia involves both cellular and paracellular pathways. In fact, the <b>ion</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the basolateral membrane and paracellular pathway remain largely unknown. Here we use a biophysical model for water and ion transport to quantify <b>ion</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of all pathways (apical, basolateral, paracellular) in human nasal epithelia cultures using experimental (Ussing Chamber and microelectrode) data reported in the literature. We derive analytical formulas for the steady-state short-circuit current and membrane potential, which are for polarized epithelia the equivalent of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for single isolated cells. These relations allow parameter estimation to be performed efficiently. By providing a method to quantify all the <b>ion</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of respiratory epithelia, the model may aid us in understanding the physiology that regulates normal airway surface hydration...|$|R

25|$|In general, the {{molecular}} pathomechanism of ACHM is either {{the inability to}} properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas {{this is not the}} case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, <b>ion</b> <b>permeability</b> (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.|$|E

In the eel, ingested sea water seems to be diluted mainly in the esophagus by passive diffusion of the ions into the blood without addition of water.

The blockage at negative membrane voltages shows a steep concentration dependence with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2. The blockage from the internal face requires approximately 1000 -fold higher Ca 2 + concentrations. Neutralization of a glutamate residue (E 363) in the putative pore region between transmembrane segments H 4 and H 5 induces outward rectification and changes relative ion conductances but leaves relative <b>ion</b> <b>permeabilities</b> nearly unaffected.
