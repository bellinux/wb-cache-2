50|$|The most typical soil is the {{rendzina}} (a dark, grayish-brown, humus-rich, <b>intrazonal</b> <b>soil)</b> and {{the brown}} forest soil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intrazonal</b> <b>soils</b> {{have more}} or less {{well-defined}} soil profile characteristics that reflect the dominant influence of some resident factor of relief or parent material over the classic zonal effects of climate and vegetation. There are three major sub-types, two of which have two further sub-types each.|$|R
40|$|In the Kodry Hills, {{small areas}} of virgin beech forests stands are preserved. These beech groves are {{developed}} on specific <b>intrazonal</b> lithomorphic <b>soils.</b> The mineralogical composition of substrate impedes {{the development of}} eluvial−illuvial processes and leaching of carbonates typical of the zonal soils that form under broad-leaved forests. The soils under study belong {{to the group of}} rendzic soils and can be referred to as marly rendzinas (or pseudorendzinas) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} area, the soil cover {{generally}} respects {{the principles of}} horizontal and vertical zonality, with transitions from low plain Chernisols and Aluviosols toward the Preluvosols and Luvosols characteristic for the hilly Subcarpathian area and then to themountain soils belonging to Cambisols, Spodisols and Umbrisols. Normally, this pattern {{is complicated by the}} presence of azonal and <b>intrazonal</b> <b>soils</b> such as Protisols and Anthrisols. Frequently, although the profile database was not too large, {{it can be seen that}} a part of the physical and chemical parameters respect these transitions. In what regards physical characteristics, can be seen a clear decrease in the fine sand content from the plain to the mountainous area, compensated by an increase in the percentages of silt and coarse sand. In the same direction bulk density decreases, while the soil and upper horizon depths decrease. In the case of chemical parameters, obvious differentiations occur in the case of mobile P content (decrease from Chernisols to Luvosols). Also the exchangeable bases sum and pH decrease, being compensated by an increase in hydrolytic acidity...|$|R

The great {{diversity}} of physical geographic factors, particularly lithologic conditions and terrain, determined {{to form a}} ground cover varied both {{in the range of}} soils and their distribution in space.

40|$|Phosphorus {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{elements}} essential for plant growth. Recently, Fried and Dean have proposed the “’A’ value concept” which relates the percentage of phosphorus in the plant from the applied fertilizer to the available phosphorus of the soil. The ‘A’ value concept has been used in connection with both field and green house experiments. Since field experiments are costly as well as time consuming, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the available phosphorus in several agricultural soils in Nebraska using this concept. The soils selected included typical Prairie, Chernozem and Chestnut soils as well as some <b>intrazonal</b> and azonal <b>soils</b> in Nebraska. The soils represent a wide range in soil conditions: acid to calcareous, sandy to clayey, and high to low in soluble phosphorus and organic matter. The efficacy of ‘A’ values is not altered by this range in soil properties; whereas, many chemical methods for determining available phosphorus are not equally applicable over this entire range. As a consequence, ‘A’ values should provide an excellent means for the calibration of chemical testing methods over this great diversity of soil conditions. Advisor: R. A. Olso...|$|R
