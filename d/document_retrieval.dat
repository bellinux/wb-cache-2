[...] The article notes that Tiffany Stanley's [...] "reporting on this story was partially subsidized {{by a grant from}} the Fund for Investigative Journalism. The website for the Fund for Investigative Journalism notes, [...] "With FIJ grants, journalists investigate abuse of power in the public and private sectors. The financial support helps freelancers and reporters working for nonprofit news organizations cover the necessary costs of <b>document</b> <b>retrieval,</b> travel to develop and interview sources, and rental fees for equipment used for multi-media story-telling. A typical grant is $5,000." [...] The article does not mention that there were no charges or arrests following a police investigation of the child sex abuse allegations. It also does not mention that an independent investigator found that most of the charges in the child sex abuse lawsuit [...] "likely never happened at all", except for the three cases which already had been criminally prosecuted - two of them several decades ago (none of which involved church employees or church property). Stanley also does not mention that one of the plaintiffs has recanted her charges as false, nor does she make mention of why the Palmer family sued the ministry. She also does not mention that Judge Burrell took the unusual step of dismissing the case [...] "with prejudice" [...] barring the way for the plaintiffs to ever bring it again in Maryland.|$|E

40|$|Most digital {{documents}} {{within an}} enterprise reside outside traditional databases. Search engines {{have been used}} to retrieve these digital documents but the results are often unsatisfactory. Digital libraries yield search results with greater precision than general search engines and are capable of compartmentalizing a wide variety of digital documents. However, digital libraries cannot subtly control application-specific <b>document</b> <b>retrievals</b> because they lack a formal model for recognizing the intrinsic relationships among digital documents. This research proposes a formal model, the Entity-Oriented Enterprise Documentation Model (EOEDM), to facilitate <b>document</b> <b>retrievals</b> for enterprise applications. This EOEDM is a meta-level modeling schema, exploiting the entity-relationship model in database design as well as the object model in application design. Since enterprise documents usually result from business activities, the proposed model targets the enterprise documentation needs and relies on the patterns of business activities to associate and locate digital documents with higher precision and better recall...|$|R

The emerging MPEG- 7 multimedia standard uses XML Schema:Datatypes for multimedia content descriptions and has posed an interesting challenge to XML query language design for XML <b>document</b> <b>retrievals.</b> Most XML query language proposals have limitations in specifying queries {{for this type of}} XML documents. In this paper, we have identified some critical specification issues in MPEG- 7 XML queries and propose an XML query language, MMDOC-QL with multimedia query constructs. MMDOC-QL is based on a logic formalism, called path predicate calculus. In this path predicate calculus, the atomic logic formulas are element predicates rather than relation predicates in relational calculus. In this path calculus query language, queries in this calculus are equivalent to finding all proofs to existential closure of logical assertions in the form of path predicates that the tree document elements must satisfy. Spatial, temporal and visual datatypes and relationships can also be described in this formalism for content retrieval. A Logic Approach for MPEG- 7 XML Document Querie...|$|R
