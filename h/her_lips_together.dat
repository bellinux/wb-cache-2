60|$|She pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> again, {{and took}} a long deep breath.|$|E
60|$|She pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> in {{that old}} {{familiar}} hunt for words and phrases.|$|E
60|$|She pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> and {{remained}} still and silent, dark against the casement window.|$|E
60|$|The girl's face hardened. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> came <b>together</b> in {{familiar}} fashion.|$|R
60|$|She paused with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> pressed <b>together,</b> <b>her</b> brows {{a little}} knit.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more she}} was silent, {{pressing}} <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> closely <b>together,</b> as if {{afraid of what}} she might say.|$|R
60|$|She {{accepted}} this gruesome intelligence without {{any signs of}} distress. But she pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Kingdom pursed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> to {{suppress}} the words {{she was afraid to}} utter, and rang the bell.|$|E
60|$|The pretty maid {{heard the}} gruesome {{intelligence}} without {{any signs of}} distress. But she pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} there, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> pressed <b>together</b> {{as she thought}} over the matter, when Mrs. Barker came into the room.|$|R
60|$|She set <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> firmly <b>together,</b> {{and there}} was a look in her face which alone was quite {{sufficient}} to deter Mr. Cuthbert from further argument.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amen," [...] said Steinmarc, {{like the}} parish clerk. Linda pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> close <b>together,</b> {{so that there}} should be no {{possibility}} of a chance sound passing from them.|$|R
6000|$|She pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together.</b> [...] "I see," [...] {{she said}} brightly. [...] "But then, was I not detestable too? so stubborn, so wilful, so demented, so--vain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Johnny," [...] said Mrs. Medliker, setting <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> as {{the door}} closed, [...] "look me right in the face, and say where you stole that gold." ...|$|E
60|$|She was a {{wonderful}} woman that, only a chit of a girl fresh from school, but as quiet and strong as a man. She said nothing--only pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> tight, and put on her bonnet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] replied Miss Elsie, setting <b>her</b> small <b>lips</b> <b>together.</b> [...] "It's Mr. Custer. He's talking {{business}} with her now {{down on the}} beach. They'll be here when lunch is ready." ...|$|R
60|$|Beatrice had {{suddenly}} grown hard, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were set <b>together,</b> even her attitude was uncompromising.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gabriel, {{will you}} stay on with me?" [...] she said, smiling winningly, and not troubling to bring <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> quite <b>together</b> {{again at the}} end, because {{there was going to}} be another smile soon.|$|R
60|$|His wife essayed another smile, but failed. She set <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> and plodded on, Mr. Jobson chatting cheerily {{and taking}} no {{notice of the}} fact that she kept lurching against him. Two miles from home she stopped and eyed him fixedly.|$|E
6000|$|Christie folded <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> in a {{peculiar}} manner as she {{knelt down and}} removed a pair of muddy overshoes, took the dripping umbrella, and was walking away with her agreeable burden when Mr. Stuart gave her another shock by calling over the banister: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{identical}} pelisse, if you please, sir," [...] said Miss Biles, [...] "which {{you there}} advertise as {{for sale at}} one, eighteen, eleven and a halfpenny." [...] And then she pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together,</b> {{and looked at the}} shopman with such vehemence that her two eyes seemed to grow into one.|$|E
60|$|And then I {{went back}} and took Ajor {{in my arms and}} kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> while <b>together</b> we watched the last of the Americans {{disappear}} into the forest.|$|R
60|$|She drew <b>her</b> pretty <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> {{with a long}} whistle, {{and then}} leaped from the table. Her face was hard {{and her eyes were}} bright as she went to the window and looked out. He {{followed}} her timidly.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> snapped <b>together,</b> and {{she fixed}} an unseeing stare across {{to where the}} {{afternoon}} sun was beginning to glow into sunset. I gazed {{for a moment at}} her face, white, plump, tiny, and implacable, and gave her up.|$|R
6000|$|His {{being her}} own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl {{should want to}} crawl back {{to a man who}} had spurned her. Unconsciously, she had drawn herself up and pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together.</b> The girl, who {{followed}} every movement, said piteously: ...|$|E
60|$|This time Lottie kept <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together,</b> {{but the new}} hurt showed on her face. Joe {{looked at}} his watch and said it was time to go. His sister's arms went about his neck, and she kissed him soundly on the lips. She kissed Genevieve, too, and saw them to the gate, one arm of her brother about her waist.|$|E
60|$|The {{train was}} late--very late. It was Virginia who first {{caught sight of}} the new dome of the Capitol through the {{slanting}} rain, but she merely pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> and said nothing. In the dingy brick station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look after them, and a kind-hearted lady {{who had been in the}} car kissed the girl good-by.|$|E
60|$|Gertrude sat {{very still}} for a few moments, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> tightly pressed <b>together.</b> Then she made a gesture of weariness.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave her}} the one keen look. And she met it, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> tightly pressed <b>together.</b> Then he smiled.|$|R
6000|$|Isobel's cheeks had {{flushed and}} paled several times {{while he was}} speaking; then she pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> tightly <b>together,</b> and as he {{finished}} she said, [...] "I think, Doctor, it {{will be just as}} well not to discuss the matter further." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{knew when}} she sent this message that another day would not suit as well. And {{she must have}} known also that her uncle's absence made no {{difference}} in her work. Peter {{came back with a}} request from Madame Voss that Marie would go to her at once. Marie pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together,</b> clenched her fists, and walked down into the room without the delay of an instant.|$|E
60|$|Madame de la Rochefidele had an aged, cadaverous face, with {{a falling}} {{of the lower}} jaw which {{prevented}} her from bringing <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together,</b> and reduced her conversations {{to a series of}} impressive but inarticulate gutturals. She raised an antique eyeglass, elaborately mounted in chased silver, and looked at Newman from head to foot. Then she said something to which he listened deferentially, but which he completely failed to understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} we can manage it;--but I {{want you to listen to}} me first. Lord Lovel is back in London." [...] She pressed <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> and {{fastened}} one hand firmly on the other. If the assurance that was required from her was ever to be exacted, it should not be exacted by Serjeant Bluestone. [...] "I have seen his lordship to-day," [...] continued the Serjeant, [...] "and he has done me the honour to promise that he will dine here to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa said I wasn't to use {{the whip}} except {{in a case of}} necessity," [...] she said, {{reaching}} for the slender silver-handled toy, and setting <b>her</b> pretty <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> with the added determination of disobedience. [...] "G'long!"--and she laid the lash smartly on the shining backs of the animals.|$|R
60|$|Hilda sat silent, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> pressed tightly <b>together</b> and an {{expression}} of determination upon her face. The other solicitors speedily left, after more expressions of regret.|$|R
60|$|She {{was sitting}} in silence and {{apparent}} calmness, but she flushed and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> set close <b>together.</b> It was evident that no half-explanations would suffice this soul of the mountain land.|$|R
