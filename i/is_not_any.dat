5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> more extreme.|$|E

25|$|But {{because of}} the {{specific}} nature of the land, crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city stretched southwards. Then there are the upheavals of Kairouan following Hilalian's invasions in 449 AH (or 1057 AD) and {{which led to the}} decline of the city. For all these reasons, the mosque (which occupies the same place since its founding in 670) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> more situated {{in the center of the}} medina, and is thereby positioned on the extremity, near the walls.|$|E

25|$|While there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> {{specific}} formula {{the team}} obeys {{in terms of}} physical procedure, most myths involve construction of various objects to help test the myth. They use their functional workshops to create whatever is needed, often including mechanical devices and sets to simulate {{the circumstances of the}} myth. Human actions are often simulated by mechanical means in order to increase safety, and to achieve consistency in repeated actions. Methods for testing myths are usually planned and executed in a manner to produce visually dramatic results, which generally involves explosions, fires, and/or vehicle crashes. Thus, myths or tests involving explosives, firearms and vehicle collisions are relatively common.|$|E
25|$|That {{last part}} of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on {{government}} aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> better for those colored people {{than it is for}} the members of her audience. She then proposes that black people are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E
25|$|Although there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> {{official}} {{definition of}} what constitutes a Cinderella team, {{there does seem to be}} a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E

Along with the narrative of the tree's life, the book includes digressions into related topics, such as the history of botany and animal life in the forest.

500|$|The {{original}} Razer Naga had {{a positive}} reception, although many pointed out the obvious targeting towards MMO gamers. Nicholas Deleon on the tech site TechCrunch said the Naga is a good and comfortable mouse. He noted that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> better than using a keyboard, and how {{the usefulness of the}} mouse would depend on how much the user is willing to practice and learn how to use it. Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica called it a [...] "niche product", stating the buttons were unappealing to people who did not play MMO games. The redesigned version of the Naga, called the Naga Epic Molten, received positive reviews for its design.|$|E

There is no backward compatibility with songs or controllers from previous editions of the franchise; FreeStyleGames' developer Jamie Jackson justified the decision, explaining that Guitar Hero Live was a [...] "completely new game" [...] that existing content would not work with due to the change in core gameplay. There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> traditional downloadable content for {{the game in the}} form of additional songs, instead using the streaming nature of GHTV to provide new songs. FreeStyleGames does not expect to make GHTV content available for offline play.|$|E
500|$|Wagner-Martin {{speculates that}} Hemingway may {{have wanted to}} have a weak or {{negative}} hero as defined by Edith Wharton, but he had no experience creating a hero or protagonist. [...] At that point his fiction consisted of extremely short stories, not one of which featured a hero. The hero changed during the writing of The Sun Also Rises: first the matador was the hero, then Cohn was the hero, then Brett, and finally Hemingway realized [...] "maybe there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> hero at all. Maybe a story is better without any hero." [...] Balassi believes that in eliminating other characters as the protagonist, Hemingway brought Jake indirectly into the role of the novel's hero.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{similarities}} to real murder cases, David Sims noted the focus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> single case, arguing that when an [...] "abhorrent crime" [...] occurs people create [...] "totem {{of hatred and}} evil" [...] through the murder's figures. He said Brooker examines {{what he calls the}} [...] "lurid media frenzy" [...] trend. Lambie, as well as Aubrey Page of Collider.com, considered it was mainly directed towards tabloids' coverage of criminal cases that turn them into [...] "witch hunts". Simon Cocks of Screen Anarchy affirmed it is an allegory of the Internet, but also a discussion on how society process information and treat shocking news stories. Paste Roxanne Sancto wrote it is aimed at media's tendency [...] "to turn horrific news stories into national spectacles, riling people up to the point of mass panic and violence in the process". Alfred Joyner of International Business Times stated [...] "the argument is that in the media notorious criminals must be demonised to appease the public's insatiable appetite to see that 'justice' is served".|$|E

500|$|Ninja Gaiden II was {{reviewed}} again in 2007 {{when the game}} was released for the Virtual Console and received some praise as well as criticism from reviewers. Austin Shau from GameSpot compared the game with the first Ninja Gaiden game as examples of [...] "mean-spirited games" [...] on the NES with high, unforgiving difficulty and excellent controls and gameplay. He applauds Tecmo's artistic detail in the cutscenes, saying that it enhances the storyline and offsets the tedious dialogue. He said that the visuals are better {{than those in the}} first game with the usage of [...] "dynamic environments" [...] such as speeding trains, and he praises the game's fast-paced sound. He and IGN's Lucas Thomas praised the improvement in the controls from its predecessor, more specifically Ryu's ability to freely climb up and down walls and use special weapons while on the walls. Thomas enjoyed the game's [...] "chief innovation" [...] of Ryu's ability to clone himself and use them to take care of enemies – something in which he says [...] "make progressing through levels and taking down bosses much easier and quicker". Reviewers said that the game's difficulty remains high for players as with the previous Ninja Gaiden game. Shau noted that the game is still difficult as was its predecessor but said that the sequel is slightly easier. Thomas stated that the sequel <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>any</b> easier to beat than its predecessor and that players will still get frustrated, especially with new environmental features such as blowing wind and rain and absolute darkness in which flashes of lightning illuminates the platforms. Thomas' only criticism of the game was that the storyline was not as good as its predecessor, saying that the plot seemed more predictable and that the cutscenes seemed more generic the second time around. Overall, he noted the lasting appeal of the game, saying that Ninja GaidenII is [...] "a challenging experience the likes of which gamers in the 8-bit era lived and died for".|$|E
