He says, 'I even now must be very reticent.' I think what Doyle is hinting at is that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat in Baker Street and said, 'Right, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and kill him, aren't we? That's {{the only way we can}} do this.' So they break in, kill him, and then Dr. Watson writes up a version of the story that puts the murder [...]|$|E
500|$|In early 1965, Caesar and Cleo {{began calling}} {{themselves}} Sonny & Cher. Following {{the recording of}} [...] "I Got You Babe", they traveled to England in July 1965 at the Rolling Stones' advice; Cher recalled, [...] " [...] had told us... that Americans just didn't get us and {{that if we were}} going to make it big, we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to England." [...] According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "English newspaper photographers showed up when S were thrown out of the London Hilton [...] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars.

40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R
40|$|It became {{apparent}} in the beginning that the union was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change their approach and that we, at the cooperative, were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change ours [...] They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> understand {{that they were not}} the only ones who represent {{the best interests of the}} workers and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> let them in—to accept that they could bring situations to our attention...|$|R

500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

Before the recording, LaBour told Bailey that his article had been intended as a joke, and Bailey sighed and replied: [...] "Well, we have an hour of television to do; you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with this." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{what was}} {{supposed}} to be Cleverly's toughest fight to date, he out skilled and out pointed Krasniqi winning by unanimous decision at the Wembley Arena on 20 April 2013. The judges gave Cleverly every round (120-108) whilst one judge credited Krasniqi with some even rounds, scoring it (119-111). Cleverly set the pace of the fight throughout behind his jab and when he saw the chance, landed a flurry of punches. In the post-fight, Cleverly spoke of his game plan going into the fight, I thought sooner or later he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but he was very tough. Plan A was to box and Plan B was to get inside. He was hurt a lot but he wasn't quite ready to go, so in the end I had to revert to Plan A." [...] With the win, Cleverly stayed on course for a unification fight against Bernard Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Elizabeth's {{personality}} and views has been compiled from impressions and descriptions by those she has met. Canadian politician Michael Ignatieff remarked in 2010, after a private audience with the Queen, how he was struck by her [...] "wonderful sense of the absurd" [...] and noted her [...] "sense of humour, that sense of the absurd, that sense of comedy of life has survived 60 years of gruelling public life." [...] After a weekend at Balmoral Castle hosted by the Queen, Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean recounted witnessing a relaxed, informal home life: Elizabeth and her family preparing a meal together—including a salad dressing devised by the Queen—and doing the washing up afterwards. Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, commented on Elizabeth's personality as [...] "individualistic". Hicks' mother remembers back to when George VI died. Elizabeth was in Kenya with her husband when she found out, [...] "I’m so sorry, but we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to England," [...] she recalled Elizabeth saying.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
