On the ensuing drive, Boise State {{completed}} three first downs on the series. BSU kicker Kyle Brotzman, converted a 31yard field goal and the Broncos shrank the <b>ECU</b> lead further.

50|$|The {{value of}} the rose varies {{according}} to the munificence of the pontiffs or the economic circumstances of the times.Baldassari (1709) says that the rose conferred about the year 1650 cost about 500 <b>écus</b> (scudi d'oro; 500 <b>écus</b> are {{the equivalent of about}} 1.7 kg of gold).The two roses sent by Pope Alexander VII were valued at about 800 and 1200 <b>écus</b> respectively. Pope Clement IX sent the Queen of France one costing about 1600 <b>écus,</b> made of eight pounds of gold. The workmanship on this rose was exceedingly fine, for which the artificer received the equivalent of 300 <b>écus.</b> Innocent XI caused seven and one-half pounds of gold to be formed into a rose, which was further embellished with many sapphires, costing in all 1450 écus.Rock (1909) adds that in the 19th century not a few of the roses cost 2000 <b>écus</b> and more.|$|R
5|$|East Carolina {{had been}} shaky on defense. <b>ECU</b> ranked 98th in total defense and 115th in passing defense, giving up {{an average of}} 436.42yards per game. Despite that fact, the Pirates did well in the {{turnover}} battle, gaining 27turnovers while losing just 13–a margin of +14–good enough for ninth in the country. In addition, the <b>ECU</b> defense ranked eleventh nationally in tackles for loss. Defensive linemen Zack Slate and C.J. Wilson and defensive back Van Eskridge took C–USA All–Conference second team honors.|$|E
5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. <b>ECU</b> needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, <b>ECU</b> led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (<b>ECU)</b> would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the <b>ECU</b> depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E

40|$|Automotive {{architectures}} {{consist of}} multiple {{electronic control units}} (<b>ECUs)</b> which run distributed control applications. Such <b>ECUs</b> are connected to sensors and actuators and communicate via shared buses. Resource arbitration at the <b>ECUs</b> {{and also in the}} communication medium, coupled with variabilities in execution requirements of tasks results in jitter in the signal/data streams existing in the system. As a result, buffers are required at the <b>ECUs</b> and bus controllers. However, these buffers often implement different semantics – FIFO queuing, which is the most straightforward buffering scheme, and data refreshing, where stale data is overwritten by freshly sampled data. Traditional timing and schedulability analysis that are used to compute, e. g., end-to-end delays, in such automotive architectures can only model FIFO buffering. As a result, they return pessimistic delay and resource estimates because in realit...|$|R

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (<b>ECU),</b> an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the <b>ECU</b> changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E
