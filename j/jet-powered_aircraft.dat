5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while flying a <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1942, the USAAF {{sent out}} a Request for Proposals (RfP) for a {{diminutive}} piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1942, Gollob {{was made}} Jagdfliegerführer 3, {{responsible}} for tactical fighter command over northwestern France. Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 (Jafü5—5th Fighter Pilot Leader) on 6 September 1943. In this command position, {{he was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 20 April 1943, effective as of 1 April, and to Oberst on 1 May 1944. When he became Jafü5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5. Jagd-Division (5th Fighter Division) about the suitability of the Bf109 on the Western Front. He indicated that in its present state the Bf109G-3 to G-6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw190 and Bf109 were inferior to enemy aircraft. Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft. Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me262 in a fighter-bomber role, which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor.|$|E

25|$|Sea Furies {{were issued}} to Nos. 736, 738, 759 and 778 Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. The F X was {{followed}} by the Sea Fury FB 11 fighter-bomber variant, which eventually reached a production total of 650 aircraft. The Sea Fury remained the Fleet Air Arm’s primary fighter-bomber until 1953, at which point <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> such as the Hawker Sea Hawk and Supermarine Attacker, were introduced to operational service.|$|E
25|$|The Viscount's good {{performance}} and popularity with customers encouraged Vickers to privately finance and develop an enlarged and re-engined {{variant of the}} Viscount, later designated as the Vickers Vanguard. The Vanguard drew extensively from the knowledge and design of the Viscount, and likewise maintained its advantage of lower operating costs over pure <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but its disadvantage in being slower than jet aircraft became increasingly critical as jets became more available over time.|$|E
25|$|Production {{of model}} {{aircraft}} resumed {{after the war}} with a mixture re-issues of pre-war and new models of civilian airliners and new <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Production of Dinky planes tailed off in 1968 but was resurgent in 1971 {{with a range of}} World War II types complete with battery-powered propellers, modern jet fighters, and even a Sea King helicopter. These large scale planes had been developed by Airfix but were made by Meccano Ltd. which had just been bought by Airfix.|$|E

This is intended to reduce pilot workload and allows the PC-24 to be single-pilot certified. Several competing business aircraft were identified early on, including Embraer's Phenom 300 and Cessna's Citation CJ4.|$|E
25|$|One {{version that}} did {{see the light}} of day was the Metro 25, which {{featured}} an increased passenger capacity of 25 at the expense of the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a passenger door on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod for baggage. A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989. Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> with TFE731s in over-wing pods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} years of the Second World War, Hawker's design team had become {{increasingly}} interested in developing a fighter aircraft that took advantage of the newly developed jet propulsion technology. Prior to this, Hawker had been heavily committed until late 1944 to the production and further development of its existing piston-powered aircraft, such as the Hurricane, Tempest and Typhoon, to meet the wartime demands for these aircraft. On 1 September 1944, the first prototype of the company's latest fighter aircraft, the Hawker Fury/Sea Fury, conducted its maiden flight; it was this aircraft that would serve as the fundamental design basis for Hawker's first <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The de Havilland DH 112 Venom was a British post-war single-engined jet {{aircraft}} developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. Much of its design {{was derived from}} the de Havilland Vampire, the firm's first <b>jet-powered</b> combat <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of the XP-55 was not very impressive and was often inferior to that of more conventional fighter aircraft already in service.

25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> began to appear in navies.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E
25|$|Originally 300 F.1s were ordered, but {{the total}} {{produced}} {{was reduced to}} 20 aircraft as the follow-on orders had been converted to the more advanced models. Some of the last major refinements to the Meteor's early design were trialled using this first production batch, and {{what was to become}} the long-term design of the engine nacelles was introduced upon EE211. The original nacelles had been discovered by the RAE to suffer from compressibility buffeting at higher speeds, causing increased drag, and the re-designed longer nacelles eliminated this and provided an increase in the Meteor's maximum speed. The lengthened nacelles were introduced on the final fifteen Meteor IIIs. EE215 was the first Meteor to be fitted with guns; EE215 was also used in engine reheat trials, the addition of reheat increasing top speed from 420mph to 460mph. and was later converted into the first two-seat Meteor. Due to the radical differences between <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> and those that preceded, a special Tactical Flight or T-Flight unit was established to prepare the Meteor for squadron service, led by Group Captain Hugh Joseph Wilson. The Tactical Flight was formed at Farnborough in May 1944, the first Meteors arriving the following month, upon which both tactical applications and limitations were extensively explored.|$|E
50|$|The Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 was a British flying wing {{aircraft}} {{design of the}} late 1940s for research into a proposed flying wing jet airliner. Three aircraft, the A.W.52G glider and two <b>jet-powered</b> research <b>aircraft,</b> were built for the programme. The airliner was cancelled but research flying continued until 1954.|$|R
50|$|The unique oblique wing was {{demonstrated}} on a small, subsonic <b>jet-powered</b> research <b>aircraft</b> called the AD-1 (Ames-Dryden-1).

25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the F-82 pilots would exceed all expectations in aerial combat. On 28 June, orders came down for all F-82s {{to be used}} in heavy ground support against any North Korean activity found between the front lines and the 38th Parallel. Every F-82 which could be made ready for flight was pressed into combat service. Although Fifth Air Force needed every available aircraft to slow down the North Korean invasion force, it was hard to justify the release of all F-82s from their defensive responsibilities for the many key bases in Japan. It was decided to release all F-82s for combat except for a flight which was deployed from the 4th F(AW)S in Okinawa to Japan and a full squadron of F-80s for air defense. On 30 June, FEAF requested HQ USAF for an additional 21 F-82 aircraft, which was denied. In addition, the projected level of support which could be provided at the level of combat usage FEAF was experiencing was no more than 60 days due to a shortage of parts. The fact was that, when F-82 production ended in April 1948, no provision had been made for an adequate supply of spare parts, as the aircraft was not expected to remain in operational service once <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> were available. Further, the Air Force simply did not have that many F-82s in the first place (182 total operational aircraft), {{and did not want to}} weaken the F-82 units committed to the Pacific Northwest or Atlantic coast, or to draw from the fourteen F-82Hs in Alaska.|$|E
500|$|The Hawker Hunter is a {{transonic}} British jet-powered fighter {{aircraft that}} was developed by Hawker Aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was designed {{to take advantage of}} the newly developed Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine and the swept wing, and was the first <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft</b> produced by Hawker to be procured by the RAF. On 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft, achieving a speed of [...]|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 1953, {{the first}} {{production}} standard Hunter F.1, {{fitted with a}} single 7,600lbf (33.80kN) Avon 113 turbojet, made its first flight. The first 20 aircraft were, in effect, a pre-production series and featured a number of [...] "one-off" [...] modifications such as blown flaps and area ruled fuselage. On 7 September 1953, the sole Hunter Mk 3 (the modified first prototype, WB 188) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for <b>jet-powered</b> <b>aircraft,</b> attaining a speed of 727.63mph (1,171.01km/h) over Littlehampton, West Sussex.
