40|$|ABSTRACTProximal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> is an {{orthopedic}} disease that is prevalent during adolescence, because this {{coincides with the}} time of greatest growth of osteomuscular structures. Curiously, some patients present this disease early, and this outcome converts to the possible etiological explanation that the slippage might occur through a growth spurt. For these patients, {{the genesis of the}} slippage has not yet been elucidated, but endocrine disorders have been noted as possible causes. In an attempt to strengthen the theory of endocrinological etiology and present the results from surgical treatment for this pathological condition, the case of a male patient aged 9 years and 3 months with proximal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> and subclinical hypothyroidism who was diagnosed and treated at our university's teaching hospital is reported here...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the treatment of}} severe proximal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> through subtrochanteric osteotomy using the Ilizarov method and to propose a new method for calculating the necessary correction. Methods: A case study was carried out among patients affected by severe proximal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> who underwent subtrochanteric osteotomy with external multiplanar fixation and were evaluated postoperatively using the modified Southwick classification. A method was developed for calculating the angular correction needed for the surgical procedure. Results: Thirteen hips were analyzed: four left hips (30. 8 %) and nine right hips (69. 2 %). The majority of the patients (61. 5 %) were male, {{with a mean age}} of 14 years. In relation to pain and function, the results were excellent for 30. 8 %, good for 46. 2 % and regular for 23. 0 %, and none of the patients presented poor results. Regarding mobility, the results were excellent for 46. 2 %, good for 30. 8 % and regular for 23. 0 %. Radiographically, the results were excellent for 7. 7 %, good for 69. 2 %, regular for 15. 4 % and poor for 7. 7 %. Conclusions: Percutaneous treatment of severe proximal epiphysiolysis using the Ilizarov method is a good treatment option with good indices for improvement of pain and function. The proposed calculation method can help in planning surgical procedures, with variations between calculated and measured angles of the order of 3 °...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile <b>femoral</b> head <b>epiphysiolysis</b> (JFHE) is a {{relatively}} rare and not fully understood endocrine and orthopedic disease. For decades, the approach and techniques of surgical treatment have undergone significant changes and still continue to be improved. This paper presents a 36 year old follow-up results of treatment effects of JFHE {{according to one of}} the previously used surgical techniques...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{assess the}} {{importance}} of using conventional magnetic resonance imaging and T 2 mapping to determine the pre-slip stage of the contralateral epiphysis in patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of unilateral proximal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> who were initially treated with in-situ fixation. Methods: This prospective clinical study on 11 patients with unilateral epiphysiolysis was conducted between February 2009 and August 2010, using magnetic resonance imaging on the contralateral hip. Results: We observed abnormalities in the proximal femoral capital physis of the contralateral unaffected hip, with edema under the growth plate in 27 % of the patients assessed. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging is an early and sensitive method for detecting the pre-slip stage of the proximal femoral epiphysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{aetiology}} of slipped femoral capital epiphysis {{is still}} unknown although many theories have been proposed. It {{is well documented}} that the highest incidence is during the adolescent growth spurt. Our experience with a patient in whom <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> occurred while she was receiving human growth hormone prompted this report. CASE REPORT A girl aged fifteen was seen at the Royal Victoria Hospital in 1970 because of failure to grow and a generally infantile appearance. She was noted to have normal body proportions but no secondary sexual characteristics. Her parents and sister were of average height. After extensive biochemical and radiological investigations (Table I) a diagnosis of selective growth hormone deficiency was made. From August 1971 the patient received an intramuscular injection of five international units of human growth hormone three times a week. The response in terms of linear growth is shown in Figure 1...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Injuries of {{the distal}} femur are rare in children; however, they are {{frequently}} associated with complications. They {{are almost always}} physeal, most frequently Salter-Harris type II epiphyseolysis. The treatment of such injuries is similar in all physeal injuries. It is intended to provide growth plate recovery by gentle reduction and stable fixation thus preventing secondary complications, and also to provide decompression of the segment to solve the compartment syndrome and recover the neurovascular structures. Case Outline A seven-year old boy presented with a right knee injury while sleigh riding. He was admitted three weeks following the injury with distal <b>femoral</b> <b>epiphysiolysis</b> associated with peroneal palsy. A day after admission to our Institute the reduction was performed using the Ilizarov device. Physical therapy was started immediately after surgery, as well as walking with weight bearing on the operated leg. Five months after surgery the patient was anatomically and functionally recovered. Conclusion The presented method is recommended {{in the treatment of}} such injuries because of several reasons; reposition is simple and complete, {{there is no need to}} open the fracture site, fixation is stable, the growth plate is preserved, there is no need for additional external immobilisation, and physical therapy involving walking with weight bearing on the operated leg may be started immediately after surgery. ...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Estudo clínico prospectivo de 11 pacientes com epifisiólise unilateral entre fevereiro de 2009 e agosto de 2010, com ressonância magnética do quadril contralateral. RESULTADOS: Verificamos alterações na região fisária capital femoral proximal no lado contralateral à doença, com edema sob a placa de crescimento em 27 % dos pacientes analisados. CONCLUSÃO: A ressonância magnética é um método sensível e precoce para detecção do pré-escorregamento epifisário femoral proximal.
