5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though <b>false,</b> <b>belief</b> that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E
5|$|Not Guilty is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Harry Martin who bids goodbye to his blind mother before he leaves the house and soon encounters a fleeing thief. The thief deposits a stolen purse into Harry's pocket and the police promptly discover and arrest Harry. They take {{him back to his}} home where he bids goodbye and is jailed. His blind mother becomes ill, under the <b>false</b> <b>belief</b> that her son is away on a journey. After he learns of this, he breaks out and returns home. The police surround and search the house and Harry flees to another building on a clothesline. Successfully having eluded the police, Harry buys a paper the following morning and discovers that the real thief has turned himself in. The film is known for its early use of a close-up shot to portray the complex action of the thief depositing the purse into Harry's pocket. The film was released on September 20, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film survives in the Library of Congress archives.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} about the treatment of asylum seekers in Australia in recent years, with the Australian Government continuing to enforce a very hard-line stance on asylum seekers who arrive to Australia by boat. The present study examined attitudes towards asylum seekers using 164 Australian community members during June 2015 by way of questionnaire. Our primary research question involved how five variables predicted <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> about asylum seekers. Specifically, we measured prejudice, the third-person effect, and confidence in the answers given to <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> about asylum seekers. Regression {{results indicated that the}} main predictors of <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> were right-wing political orientation, prejudice, confidence in espousing <b>false</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and the third-person effect (politicians). Furthermore, most of our community participants accepted a large number of <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> as being true, with approximately two-thirds of our participants scoring above the midpoint. This reflects similar findings over the last decade or so. Our results indicate that, if one believes in bottom-up change, a more nuanced approach needs to be undertaken with community anti-prejudice interventions...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{quantitative}} {{research has found}} that people who report negative attitudes toward asylum seekers also tend to report the acceptance of information that is factually incorrect (negative 'false beliefs'). In the present study, we were interested in matching spontaneously generated <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> with negative attitudes toward asylum seekers, and in examining the presence of such beliefs in politicians' public statements. To do this, we analysed qualitative data collected from 602 Western Australian participants. Three <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> were frequently cited ('boat people are queue jumpers', 'asylum seekers are illegal' and 'people who arrive unauthorised are not genuine refugees'). As predicted, the total number of <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> significantly correlated with negative attitudes. The same beliefs were also identified in statements made by Federal Government representatives. Our results have important practical implications. If <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> about asylum seekers can be identified and corrected, this may {{have a significant effect on}} changing these attitudes in a positive direction...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years in Australia, the issue of asylum seekers has been a {{significant}} feature of the media, and a topic that many people feel very strongly about. However, there is little empirical research regarding attitudes toward asylum seekers. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine such attitudes in the Perth community, and what predicts them. In Study 1, an Attitudes Toward Asylum Seekers (ATAS) scale was constructed. In Study 2, self-esteem, national identity, <b>false</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and sociodemographics were used in an attempt to predict ATAS in a random survey of the Perth metropolitan area. Results indicated a weak correlation between high self-esteem and negative attitudes, and a strong correlation between a high level of <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> and negative attitudes. As a result of this latter relationship, two hierarchical regression equations were constructed: one predicting negative attitudes, the other predicting <b>false</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Regarding the ATAS scale, being male, higher levels of education, right-wing political position, and high levels of national identity had significant predictive value. Regarding the <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> scale, higher levels of education, right-wing political position, high levels of national identity, and increased age had significant predictive value. Given the large number of participants who scored above the midpoint of the ATAS scale, coupled with the high level of <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> reported, we suggest that a great deal of education about asylum seekers is called for...|$|R

40|$|False memory {{implantation}} {{studies are}} characterised by suggestions indicating that specific unremembered events occurred, attributing suggested events to a knowledgeable source (e. g., parents), and including true events that {{provide evidence that}} this source was consulted. These characteristics create a particular retrieval context that influences how individuals {{come to believe that}} false events occurred. Two studies used a variant of implantation methods to vary the proportion of events attributed to parents and the presence of true events within the suggestion. In Study 1 participants received six false events, and were told that all or some events came from parents. Participants told that all of the events came from parents formed more and stronger <b>false</b> <b>beliefs.</b> In Study 2 participants also received two true events, and a third group was told that half of the events came from their parents. Participants given the specific ratio ("half") endorsed more <b>false</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and beliefs between the other groups no longer differed. Across both studies participants told that some events came from parents reported stronger memory phenomenology. The effect of suggestions on <b>false</b> <b>beliefs</b> in implantation studies depends partly on the credibility of suggestions derived from providing information about the source of suggested events...|$|R
