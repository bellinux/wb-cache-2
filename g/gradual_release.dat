25|$|The last {{phase of}} <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of {{responsibility}} {{provides students with}} the opportunity to employ what they have learned in a new situation. Students can be given a variety of independent tasks but the assignments should reflect the other phases of instructional content. While students are working, the teacher's role is to circulate the room listening and making observations.|$|E
25|$|The goal of guided {{instruction}} in the <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of responsibility model is to guide students toward using different skills, strategies and procedures independently. The student will assume more responsibility with less support from the teacher. Lessons are created as to ensure student success. Oftentimes when students are struggling with a concept in the classroom, {{they do not need}} more teacher modelling, what they really need is guidance and support to meet high expectations.|$|E

500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of blood from her face.|$|E
2500|$|Collaborative or {{cooperative}} learning {{requires students to}} act as a members of a team. [...] A skill set that includes leadership, active listening, decision making, turn taking and trust making are useful in collaborative learning. [...] These teamwork skills need to be purposely taught as part of the <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of responsibility model.|$|E
2500|$|Collaborative {{learning}} {{is the third}} component of the <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of responsibility model where students work in small heterogeneous groups on activities {{that allow them to}} deepen their understanding through application of the concept being learned. [...] This stage of the model {{is the beginning of the}} transfer of responsibility from the teacher to the students. [...] The collaborative learning component requires that each student is accountable for their participation by producing an independent product while engaged with his peers.|$|E

2500|$|The focused {{lesson is}} the first phase in a <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of {{responsibility}} model. [...] Other names for this are modeling, direct instruction, explicit instruction, or teacher instructed mini-lessons. [...] This is a powerful, but brief, segment of instruction time as it is when the teacher demonstrates, models, and shares what the teacher, is thinking. [...] The teacher verbalizes their internal thought processes to explain and explicitly show {{the focus of the}} lesson, skills, or concepts. [...] Or the teacher invites the students into their mind to witness their thought process, how it is done and how decisions are made during the task. This {{is not the time to}} simply tell the students things, but to let them know how to do them and why.|$|E
2500|$|Analysis {{of these}} records reveals another {{interesting}} fact: planktonic (floating) forams record {{the shift to}} lighter isotope values earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower [...] ) methanogenic carbon can only {{be incorporated into the}} forams' shells after it has been oxidised. A <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic forams show lighter values earlier. The fact that the planktonic forams are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of {{responsibility}} model or GRR {{model is a}} particular style of teaching which is a structured method of pedagogy framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process from the teacher to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming [...] "all the responsibility for performing a task...to {{a situation in which}} the students assume all of the responsibility". The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for their own learning and directs this learning through the cognitive processes involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice (personalised learning). As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model [...] "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} American foreign policy towards Cuba after President Barack Obama became president. The main {{objective of this}} work is to answer how the US- Cuban relationship has changed since 2009, and to show the positive approach of the new president and his government administration towards Cuba and their share on these changes. The thesis analyses factors that resulted in <b>gradual</b> <b>releasing</b> of political tension between the US and Cuba, events that contributed to this process over the years 2009 - 2014 and steps that US and Cuban governments have undertaken to develop mutual cooperation. The work focuses mainly on the influence throughout presidency of Obama and his efforts to start negotiations with Cuban government. Along with this, the thesis analyses matters that prevented and still partly prevent full recovery of US-Cuban future cooperation, such as economic embargo imposed on Cuba and lack of Cuban respect for human rights. The author comes to conclusion that recovery of diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba in December 2014 is mainly the result of forthcoming policy of Barack Obama, who refused to go on in non-functional form of the anti-Cuban policy, applied by most American Presidents since the 60 s. Thanks to Raul Castro's willingness to cooperate in joint [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{the maximum}} {{pressure}} {{is limited to}} atmospheric pressure, {{so that all the}} equipment has to be much larger and heavier to compensate. This disadvantage is made worse at high altitude. The vacuum brake is also considerably slower acting in both applying and releasing the brake; this requires a greater level of skill and anticipation from the driver. Conversely, the vacuum brake had the advantage of <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> long before the Westinghouse automatic air brake, which was originally only available in the direct-release form still common in freight service. A primary fault of vacuum brakes is the inability to easily find leaks. [...] In a positive air system, a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult, although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber (for example) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum.|$|E
2500|$|This term 'scaffolding' is {{a useful}} metaphor {{that is used to}} symbolise the process of {{supporting}} a learner {{in the early stages of}} the learning process – as the walls get higher – until there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and skills having been acquired, to then be able to remove that scaffolding so the learner is able to 'stand alone', or be effectively independent enough to continue learning 'alone'. In a similar way, there is a gradual dismantling of the scaffolding as the 'job' becomes more secure and so there is a <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of responsibility from the teacher to the learner. As scaffolding is temporary, so too are the lessons that are constructed to help students as they embark into unfamiliar thinking. As noted by Pearson and Gallagher, [...] "The critical stage of the model is the 'guided practice,' the stage in which the teacher gradually releases task responsibility to the students." [...] As such, these lessons eventually fade away as students become gradually more comfortable with the learning and are able to work without the necessary guidance of the teacher.|$|E
2500|$|The fields {{around the}} ancient village of Hove were {{owned by a}} few large landholders, whose <b>gradual</b> <b>release</b> of land for {{development}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries contributed to the town's distinctive pattern of growth: individual architects or firms designed small estates with a homogeneous overall style but with much variation between them. The Wick Estate's land was transformed between the 1820s and 1860s into the Brunswick Town estate, consisting of grand Regency/Classical-style squares and crescents of houses, with smaller versions in grid-pattern side streets. Next came the Cliftonville estate, which filled the gap between Brunswick Town and Brighton. [...] Two-storey semi-detached stuccoed villas in the Italianate style, often with canted bay windows, characterised {{the early part of}} the estate—the long north–south roads between Church Road and the seafront. [...] Cliftonville (now Hove) railway station opened to the north in 1865, stimulating further development in a similar style. [...] A railway architect, F.D. Banister, designed most of Cliftonville, including number 42 Medina Villas (his own home during the 1850s) and three surrounding houses, whose Jacobethan red-brick exteriors and curved gables contrast with the surrounding villas. The West Brighton estate's rapid development began in 1872 on land bought from the Stanford family, the area's largest landholders. [...] Until the Stanford Estate Act of Parliament was passed in 1871, no houses could be built on the land, despite tremendous pressure for growth; within 12 years, [...] were developed and Hove's housing stock had trebled. Sir James Knowles and Henry Jones Lanchester were the principal architects, and William Willett built the houses to a high standard.|$|E

Calcium phosphate cements {{have a great}} potential for local drug delivery. Release of local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, at the implant site can be useful for reducing pain immediately after implantation. In thiswork a local anesthetic – lidocaine hydrochloride –was incorporated intoα-tricalciumphosphate cement. Lidocaine release profilewas dependent on cement components used.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to {{describe}} and to evaluate the results of evaluation of the e-learning course, Information Literacy, which is taught by the librarians at the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University. In the article the results are discussed to inform about the librarians' experience with tutoring the course. The survey covers the medical students who enrolled on the course between autumn 2008 and autumn 2010. The students were requested to fill the questionnaire designed in Google Documents and based on the quantitative method, including a five-point Likert scale combined with closed and open ended questions. Results show the medical students are satisfied with the e-learning course, Information Literacy, because of time and space flexibility, studying at their own pace and online interactive tutorials. More than half the students found the <b>gradual</b> <b>releasing</b> of the study materials and the tasks as the main motivation for continous learning. Most of the students were satisfied with the taught topics like methodology of searching in the databases, using EndNoteWeb and citation style ISO 690. Most of the tasks like searching in the online databases, working with EndNoteWeb or finding the impact factor of a journal were evaluated as beneficial. The results have suggested several important revisions. The librarians have decided to create the interactive tutorials explaining the importance of the topics, remove the parts of tutorials describing the library terminology and catalogues. Two new tasks – verifying online access to the full text of journals and finding signs of plagiarism in a short text – have been added since spring 2011. The librarians will prepare some printed material supporting the course and improve the publicity of their e-learning course among the teachers. The results and its discussion can help other librarians who are going to prepare a similar e-learning course in planning the conception of their course...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the most appropriate dialysis equilibrium method to assess liposomal gel formulations containing hydrophobic drugs, to give the most accurate indication of drug release. Methods: Loperamide hydrochloride-encapsulated liposomes, composed of L-a-phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (molar ratio of 2 : 1), were prepared according to the method of dried lipid film hydration. The liposomes were incorporated into a carbopol gel (0. 5 %, weight/weight). The release of the drug from the nanoparticles was assessed using a number of variations of the dialysis technique, taking into account solubility parameters and formulation. Method 1 (below saturation point) and Method 2 (above saturation point) used a dilution method to evaluate how drug concentration and solubility affects the in vitro drug-release profile of loperamide hydrochloride, while Methods 3 (below saturation point) and 4 (above saturation point) evaluated how drug concentration and the gel base affect the release profile. Results: In Method 1, the liposomes showed a rapid release of just over 60 % in the first 3 hours and then a slower, sustained release to just over 70 % at 24 hours. Method 2 showed a <b>gradual,</b> sustained <b>release</b> profile with the liposomes with 55 % release at 24 hours. In Method 3, the liposomes showed a rapid burst release of 98 % at 2 hours. In Method 4, the liposomal gel had a rapid release of 60 % within 3 hours and then a more <b>gradual,</b> sustained <b>release</b> with 86 % release at 24 hours. The free drug suspension in Methods 2 and 4 showed a limited release across the dialysis membrane, in comparison to Methods 1 and 3, which showed a complete release in a timely manner. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the actual method used for equilibrium dialysis plays a significant role in determining the true characteristics of a topical nanoformulation, with Method 3 providing the most accurate indication of the release of a hydrophobic drug from a topical liposomal formulation...|$|R
