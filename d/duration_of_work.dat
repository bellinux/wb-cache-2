The variables that significantly affected the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> disability were age, company size, compensation benefit, pain radiation, and diagnosis. In addition, company size and pain radiation showed statistically significant time dependent effect.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of work related {{variables}} on the height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of working boys aged 10 - 16 years. Design: Cross sectional survey. Setting: Irbid, Jarash, and North Jordan Valley in Jordan. Participants: 135 working boys aged 10 - 16 years and their mothers. Outcome measures: Height for age z score; weight for age z score; BMI for age z score. Results: In bivariate analysis, child's <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (r=- 0. 20), maternal height (r= 0. 26), and household per capita income (r= 0. 23) were significantly correlated with height for age z score and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (r=- 0. 24), maternal height (r= 0. 24), and household per capita income (r= 0. 19) with. weight for age z score. <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (p< 0. 001), child's monthly income (p= 0. 044), maternal height (p= 0. 002), and household per capita income (p= 0. 005) were retained in the regression model fitted on height z score that explained 20. 1 % of the variance. The regression model fitted on weight z score explained 20. 1 % of the variance and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> (p< 0. 001), child's monthly income (p= 0. 022), household per capita income (p= 0. 017), and maternal height (p= 0. 004) were retained.

Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} suggest that the length of time children have been working and low monthly income have a detrimental effect on growth of working boys independent of the effects of low household per capita income and small maternal stature.

The effect of working as a gas station operator and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on the nasal mucociliary transport system is not yet known. Aim : Knowing the difference between nasal mucociliary transport time with a job as a gas station operator and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Methods : This study was an observational study with age matched case control design. Samples were 18 gas station officers around Tembalang Semarang and 18 students and officials at FK Undip Tembalang Semarang as the control group. Nasal mucociliary transport times were measured using saccharin test. Normality of the data was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. Results : The mean nasal mucociliary transport time on gas station officers was 1222. 56 seconds while on non gas station officers was 892. 33 seconds. The Mann-Whitney test nasal mucociliary transport time on officers and non officers showed a significant difference (p = 0. 001), whereas {{there was no significant difference}} (p = 0. 075) when compared to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Conclusion : There is a time difference of nasal mucociliary transport on gas station officers and there is no difference compared to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Key Words : Fuel vapor, nasal mucociliary transport time, job, duration of wor...|$|E

40|$|A natural {{experiment}} approach {{is used to}} examine the effect of legislative changes in New York Workers' Compensation benefits on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> absence. Using data from before and after the legislative changes, a treatment group is compared to a control group unaffected by the changes. Duration/benefit elasticity estimates for minor permanent impairments are found to be similar to existing estimates for temporary impairments but are much smaller than estimates for severe permanent impairments. When benefits available after a work absence were increased but the benefits during work absence were unchanged, duration of minor impairment claims was unchanged, but workers with severe impairments reduced the length of their work absence. This finding, together with the elasticity estimates, implies that a policy that constrained weeks of benefits but increased the value of benefits after the work absence relative to those during the absence could reduce the overall <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> absence. ...|$|E
