60|$|Affairs {{got more}} and more {{exasperating}} and strained under these pressures. The window was boarded up, and an unpleasant altercation about their delay in repairing it with the new landlord, a Bun Hill butcher--and a loud, bellowing, unreasonable person at that--served to remind them of their unsettled troubles with the old. Things were at this pitch when Bert bethought himself of creating a sort of <b>debenture</b> <b>capital</b> in the business for the benefit of Tom. But, as I have said, Tom had no enterprise in his composition. His idea of investment was the stocking; he bribed his brother not to keep the offer open.|$|E

50|$|Based on a {{study by}} an Indian {{economist}} at the World Bank, D.C. Rao, Sengupta introduced greater use of convertible <b>debentures</b> in the <b>capital</b> markets. He also permitted Reliance Industries to do what would normally be impossible: converting the non-convertible portions of their four debenture issues into equity. This transmutation allowed Reliance to continue raising more quasi-debt.|$|R

5000|$|Bhutanese law regulates incorporation, <b>capital,</b> <b>debentures,</b> {{shares and}} {{issuance}} of stock and securities, corporate management and accounting, directorships, mergers and acquisitions, and dissolution. Notably, licensure to commence {{business as a}} Bhutan corporation requires the discretionary approval of the Minister of Trade and Industry; imposes {{joint and several liability}} upon directors for ultra vires conduct; and prohibits unsecured debentures. The bulk of Bhutanese corporate law, however, is identical to those of modern nations, including statutory shareholder inspection rights, the dichotomy between [...] "equity shares" [...] (common) and preference shares, and solvency doubly defined as the ability to pay debts as they become due and as the excess of assets against debts. (Cf. general corporate and insolvency laws) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, {{at the age}} of 27, Rupert {{took over}} his late father's role as {{chairman}} of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, Claridge's, The Berkeley Hotel, Simpson's-in-the-Strand and the Grand Hotel in Rome. At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708. [...] He immediately issued £300,000 of <b>debentures</b> to raise <b>capital</b> for a large extension to the Savoy (the [...] "East Block"). [...] Like his father, Carte was willing to {{go to great lengths to}} secure the best employees for his hotels. When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous maître d'hôtel, M. Joseph, a few years earlier.|$|R
