5|$|Creeks {{traverse}} the UCSC campus within several ravines. <b>Footbridges</b> span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The <b>footbridges</b> {{make it possible}} to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations. At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.|$|E
5|$|The two-story station {{building}} {{was destroyed by}} a fire on June 11, 1983. The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism; the fire was judged to be of suspicious origin. The MBTA did not replace the building, but handicapped-accessible platforms were installed in 1992 and were connected with <b>footbridges.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, <b>footbridges</b> with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E

5|$|In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261acres (510ha), {{including}} the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, <b>footbridges</b> with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. The Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls was built at this time.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station {{is at the bottom}} of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are <b>footbridges</b> on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station car park. There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, at the south end of which is another entrance serving the station car park.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} crossed by 16 bridges as it flows through Tollymore Forest Park. The Old Bridge, built by James Hamilton in 1726, {{is the oldest}} of the current bridges. The Ivy Bridge was built in 1780 and Foley’s Bridge in 1787. Parnell Bridge, named in {{recognition}} of Sir John Parnell who visited Tollymore in the late 18th century, was constructed in 1842. It was the last stone bridge to be built in Tollymore. The more recent <b>footbridges</b> are constructed from wood. Castle Bridge is located near the mouth where Main Street crosses the river. It was originally called Fearsat an Chaislein Nui (The Ford or Pass of the Newcastle) and was next to the entrance to the castle. This was replaced by a wider, straighter bridge in the 1890s.|$|E

50|$|Access to {{the station}} is from a <b>footbridge</b> built over the railway. The <b>footbridge</b> {{is not part of}} the station(albeit painted in typical southeastern colours)with the {{entrance}} {{to the station}} built on the <b>footbridge.</b> The <b>footbridge</b> was refurbished in 2016.

5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled. Originally three {{sides of the}} Mole served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short <b>footbridges</b> were provided from the Mole for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on the siding serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E
25|$|The 191st Street {{station has}} two tracks and two side platforms. There are also covered {{pedestrian}} <b>footbridges</b> connecting the two platforms, so {{people on the}} <b>footbridges</b> cannot see the tracks and platforms (and vice versa).|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{pedestrian}} {{safety and}} to help alleviate traffic congestion at popular intersections, several pedestrian <b>footbridges</b> were erected in 1990s. Some feature designs that match {{the theme of the}} nearby resorts. The Tropicana – Las Vegas Boulevard <b>footbridges</b> were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional <b>footbridges</b> have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection connecting Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Bally's, and The Cromwell; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian, and at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall, The Palazzo and Treasure Island.

In part I, assessment of the current composite structure of <b>footbridge</b> is done, using ČSN and ČSN EN standards for adjusted static behavior of the structure. Comparison of both assessments is made and also with an original assessment from 1988. In part II, design and assessment of steel structure of <b>footbridge</b> placed on currents <b>footbridge</b> location described in part I is done. The structure was designed as two vierendeels trusses connected with cross beams, supporting concrete bridge deck. 9 variants were examined, differing with truss height {{and the number of}} verticals. Detailed design and assessment for parts of the structure is done for the chosen variant...|$|R
