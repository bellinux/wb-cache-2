50|$|The mature female seed cones are pendent, 5 - 8 cm long, 2 - 3 cm broad when closed, {{opening to}} 4 cm broad. They are {{produced}} in spring, green at first, maturing orange-brown {{in the autumn}} 6-7 months later. The seeds are 5 - 6 mm long and 3 - 4 mm broad, with a 12 - 15 mm wing. The male (pollen) cones are 2 - 3 cm long, <b>dispersing</b> <b>yellow</b> pollen in spring.|$|R
50|$|After flowering, the stamens will detach. The {{fruit is}} the part of the flower that remains after fertilisation, which enlarges, dries, and becomes woody. Triangular valves in the fruit will open, <b>dispersing</b> <b>yellow,</b> cuboid seeds. When seeds are shed from a tree, most fall onto the ground below the crown, with some seed carried by the wind and water. Dissemination occurs mostly in spring and summer, while natural {{flooding}} occurs during winter and spring. As the tree is inextricably linked with waterways, seed dispersion would logically be facilitated by floodwater. There is some contention in this theory, however, where the CSIRO describes an experiment that demonstrated seeds were found to sink after only 36 hours. It would also seem that as the seeding and flooding do not entirely coincide, it could be inferred that the conditions for germination, such as damp soil and plenty of sunlight, are more important in the continuation of the species than seed dispersal by means of floodwater. Seeding during the flooding season would prevent desiccation of the seed, which is the main cause of a seed's failure to reproduce. Despite this apparent evolutionary advantage of the species living near watercourses to avoid seed desiccation, many seeds will be produced within a Camaldulensis forest before one will grow to its own reproducing stage. A gap in the forest must be available for the germinated seed to receive adequate sunlight.|$|R

40|$|Recent wide {{spread and}} {{persistent}} harmful algal blooms (HABs) give severe impacts on {{public health and}} fisheries economics along all coasts of Korea. As the HABs have become more widespread and caused increasing fisheries damage, Korea established an integrated monitoring system included oceanographic, environmental, and red tides observations. Both oceanographic and environmental data and remotely sensed information are available for HABs prediction. Hierarchical HABs monitoring whose observation time {{is based on the}} frequency of HABs occurrence {{for the last five years}} has been run to take appropriate response actions according to the HABs magnitude since 1996. Korea has been employed a variety of mitigation strategies directly or indirectly to affect the size of a HAB population or its impacts. They can be classified into two categories: precautionary impact preventions, and bloom controls. To give precautionary attention to fishermen and aquaculturists, Korea has been operating an alert system. It consists of several alerts such as ‘Red Tide Attention’, ‘Red Tide Alert’ and ‘Warning Lift’. As one of direct HABs controls, Korea has <b>dispersed</b> <b>yellow</b> clay on coastal aquaculture farms to remove fish killing C. polykrikoides blooms since 1996. The clay can flocculate the dinoflagellate cells and causes them to sink to the bottom of the water body. This can dilute the cell density of dinoflagellates in the cages thereby not killing the accommodating fish. It has so far proven not to induce significant negative impacts on water quality or benthic organisms. In addition to clay dispersal, Korea is studying other possible mitigative substances and techniques such as biological and physical controls. Korea has joined the regional and international meeting, and continues to exchange data and information with neighboring countries such as Japan, China, South East Asian countries, and Russia through NOWPAP, PICES, APEC, and EASTHAB meetings.

But papers concerning the SO 4 2 -/SnO 2 catalyst have been quite few, because of difficulty in preparation of the oxide gels from its salts SnCl 4. A highly <b>dispersed</b> light <b>yellow</b> powder, Sb-SnO 2 nanocrystal, was obtained by the synthesis method of “P-CNAIE ” and the drying method of “AD-IAA”. The Sb doping made the energy gap of nano-crystalline SnO 2 narrower. A saturated solution of ammonium sulfate was dropped into organic solutions containing a fixed amount of Sb-SnO 2 nano-powders in different ratio in order to load Sb-SnO 2 powder with ammonium sulfate. This method has an outstanding advantage that is the loading ratio of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 to Sb-SnO 2 can come to very high and no free water causes the aggregation of Sb-SnO 2 nano powder. The methods of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) demonstrated that the working ratio of Sb-SnO 2 to (NH 4) 2 SO 4 was 1 : 1. 4 to 1 : 1. 6 wt% and the most favorable calcination temperature for the generation of superficially sulfated groups of Sb-SnO 2 particles should fall between 380 °C and 400 °C.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce chitosanase by fermenting from squid pen, and recover the {{fermented}} squid pen for dye removal by adsorption. One chitosanase induced from squid pen powder (SPP) -containing medium by Bacillus cereus TKU 034 was purified in high purification fold (441) and high yield of activity recovery (51 %) by ammonium sulfate precipitation and combined column chromatography. The SDS-PAGE results showed its molecular mass to be around 43 kDa. The TKU 034 chitosanase used for the chitooligomers preparation was studied. The enzyme products revealed that the chitosanase could degrade chitosan with various degrees of polymerization, ranging from 3 to 9, {{as well as the}} chitosanase in an endolytic manner. Besides, the fermented SPP was recovered and displayed a better adsorption rate (up to 99. 5 %) for the <b>disperse</b> dyes (red, <b>yellow,</b> blue, and black) than the water-soluble food colorants, Allura Red AC (R 40) and Tartrazine (Y 4). The adsorbed R 40 on the unfermented SPP and the fermented SPP was eluted by distilled water and 1 M NaOH to confirm the dye adsorption mechanism. The fermented SPP had a slightly higher adsorption capacity than the unfermented, and elution of the dye from the fermented SPP was easier than from the unfermented.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} the volatilisation rate of materials using a conventional thermobalance and standard sample holders is described. This was used to study two dyes; CI <b>Disperse</b> <b>Yellow</b> 54 and CI Disperse Red 60. Using pure reference materials, a relationship between volatilisation rate and vapour pressure based on the Langmuir equation for free evaporation was used to calibrate the system. Thus, the vapour pressures of the dyes could be determined. Heats of sublimation and vaporisation were calculated from a plot of the logarithm of the vapour pressure against reciprocal absolute temperature. Extrapolation of the vapour pressure vs. temperature curve outside the experimentally measured region for Red 60 was made using the melting point and heat of fusion found by DSC. Good agreement was found with literature data. In favourable cases, the melting temperature and heat of fusion can be obtained directly from thermogravimetry. # 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of occupational and non-occupational textile dermatitis {{seems to be}} increasing, probably because of changed textile manufacturing techniques. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the clinical features and epidemiology of textile contact dermatitis (TCD) in Italy. METHODS: Demographic data, clinical history aspects, atopy and positive patch test reactions to occupational and non-occupational allergens were investigated in 277 textile dermatitis patients. RESULTS: Contact dermatitis was the most frequent clinical presentation (95. 3 %). TCD was more common in females, in the fourth to fifth decades of life, and in atopic dermatitis patients. The lesions were prevalently eczematous (74. 2 %), and mostly located on the trunk and lower limbs in non-occupational cases, and on the hands in textile workers. Allergic TCD (58. 3 %) was more frequent than irritant TCD. The dyes (Disperse Blue 124, Disperse Blue 106, and <b>Disperse</b> <b>Yellow</b> 3) were most frequently responsible (79. 8 %), especially in non-occupational TCD. Formaldehyde and resins were more important in occupational TCD. Concomitant reactions among textile dyes and/or finishing resins were observed in 50. 0 % of patients.

The polyester undyed knitwear samples were dyed in baths containing the acids under the same dyeing conditions. Color differences of the samples were assessed using the reflectiometry technique and expressed in terms of CIELcoordinates. The influence of the tested acids on the surface structure of dyed polyester fibers was examined using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the differences in obtained dyeabilities, in the presence of both formic and oxalic acid, are acceptable according to both M&S 83 A and CMC (2 : 1) standards which was not the case with acetic acid. Therefore, acetic acid can be replaced with either formic or oxalic acid as substances for dyebath pH adjusting in the dyeing process described in this paper. SEM micrographs showed small differences in the surface structure of dyed fibers, as well as differences in the shape of undyed samples’ reflectance curves in presence of the acids.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact allergy to textile dyes is not uncommon. The allergy is {{detected}} by patch testing patients with commercial patch test preparations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 8 disperse dyes (DDs) used for patch {{testing in the}} departments in Malmö and in Leuven and to compare them with test preparations used at various dermatology departments. Materials/Methods: The investigated DDs were Disperse Blue (DB) 35, 106, and 124, <b>Disperse</b> <b>Yellow</b> (DY) 3, Disperse Orange (DO) 1 and 3, and Disperse Red (DR) 1 and 17. From 13 clinics, 107 petrolatum preparations were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and compared with reference substances obtained at the Malmö laboratory. Concerning DB 35, no reference substance could be identified. RESULTS: TLC visualized impurities in all DDs. For each DD, except DB 35, the mean concentration in the preparations labelled to contain 1. 0 % (w/w) were DB 106 : 0. 30 %, DB 124 : 0. 25 %, DY 3 : 0. 44 %, DO 1 : 0. 40 %, DO 3 : 0. 68 %, DR 1 : 0. 49 %, and DR 17 : 0. 35 %; there were variations between the samples also {{with regard to the}} number of impurities. DO 3 could not be demonstrated in 4 / 15 preparations labelled DO 3. CONCLUSION: The results may have implications for individual diagnosis and prevention and when comparing test results from various centres...|$|E
40|$|The {{materials}} with an ability of self-focusing/defocusing through their light intensity-dependent refractive index and phase shift properties are potential candidates for all-optical photonic devices. Several organic materials including dye-doped polymer films are attracting many researchers {{due to their}} advantages in terms of enhanced efficiency, and acceptable mechanical properties to fabricate useful devices. In this paper, we have reported the nonlinear optical properties like nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction of an organic dye <b>Disperse</b> <b>Yellow</b> - 7 (DY- 7) doped in Polymethyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid (PMMA-MA) polymer matrix using open aperture and closed aperture Z-scan experimental methods by means of low power continuous wave (CW) laser beam. The optical limiting properties of these films are also studied using Type 1 and Type 2 configurations at different input powers using continuous wave (CW) laser beams of 532 nm wavelength. The nonlinear refractive index n 2, nonlinear absorption coefficient β, changes in refractive index with input intensity, and the magnitude of third-order optical nonlinearity of the dye-doped film are experimentally determined. The sample is tested for optical power limiting in which the input limiting threshold and saturated output power level for both type 1 and type 2 optical limiting configurations are recorded. DY- 7 dye-doped in PMMA-MA polymer film has shown saturation absorption at lower input irradiance and reverse saturation absorption at higher input irradiance along with thermal nonlinearity and hence {{found to be a}} potential candidate for the third harmonic property based photonic devices...|$|E
40|$|Special {{issue with}} papers {{presented}} at ICUPCT : International Conference on Urban Planning and Transportation SystemThe photodegradation of hydrophobic disperse dyes with different chromophores {{in the presence}} of acetone (ACE) was investigated. In this study, the photodecay of dyes was carried out in the Rayonet™ RPR- 200 merry-go-round photoreactor, with 253. 7 nm monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) lamps. A typical azo disperse dye (CI <b>disperse</b> <b>yellow</b> 7 -DY 7) and an anthraquinone disperse dye (CI disperse orange - DO 11) were used as the probe compounds. The results demonstrate that the addition of acetone increases the solubility of hydrophobic disperse dyes and enhances the photosensitization reaction simultaneously. More than ten times of quantum yield enhancement is observed {{in the presence of}} ACE photosensitizer than in water alone. The photodegradation of DY 7 and DO 11 is dominated by photoreduction, which follows pseudo first-order decay, and the rate constants strongly depend on the solvent system (i. e., ACE/H 2 O ratios) and the initial pH levels. The decay quantum yields of dyes are normally observed with the increase of the ACE/H 2 O ratio. The optimum quantum yields of DY 7 and DO 11 were determined at 0. 5 (v/v) and 0. 25 (v/v), respectively, in alkaline conditions. A further increase in the ACE/H 2 O ratio reduces the quantum yields, possibly due to light attenuation by excess acetone. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
