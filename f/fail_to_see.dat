5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them as they go about their lives.|$|E

25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} the null {{hypothesis}} is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected. It is failing to assert what is present, a miss. A typeII error may be compared with a so-called false negative (where an actual 'hit' was disregarded by the test and seen as a 'miss') in a test checking for a single condition with a definitive result of true or false. A Type II error is committed when we fail to believe a true alternative hypothesis.

500|$|Marxists, who {{are skeptical}} of right-wing populist {{conspiracy}} theories, also accuse the global power elite {{of not having}} {{the best interests of}} all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> is that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E
500|$|For example, the {{following}} quote {{was presented to}} both groups of subjects: [...] "Only the willfully blind can <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the old style capitalism of a primitive freebooting period is gone forever. The capitalism of complete laissez-faire, which thrived on low wages and maximum profits for minimum turnover, which rejected collective bargaining and fought against justified public regulation of the competitive process, {{is a thing of}} the past." [...] When participants thought that Bridges (a well-known union leader) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be an [...] "expression of the accomplishments of labor in the face of opposition from capital and contained a resolve to defend these gains from attack". However, when Johnston (president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the time) was the author, they interpreted the passage to be [...] "a perspective of policy in the interest of business, especially of 'enlightened' business". Asch conducted a very similar and classic study with participants reading statements either attributed to Jefferson or Lenin.|$|E

500|$|Further, Liddell {{stated that}} one of Pickingill's covens was the New Forest coven, a Wiccan group which Gerald Gardner—the founder of Gardnerian Wicca—claimed had {{initiated}} him in 1939. However, Liddell did later state {{that he was not}} certain whether this was true. He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received [...] "the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own Bricket Wood coven. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the [...] "Third Rite" [...] from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing that in Gardnerian Wicca. As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that [...] "no impartial observer could <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that they formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca." [...] Liddell believed that while many hereditary witches despised him, Gardner represented [...] "the spiritual heir of Pickingill", because he had similarly reformed and propagated witchcraft for contemporary purposes.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} Leveson Gower withdrew his {{invitation}} for Crawford {{to appear at}} the Scarborough Festival; Leveson Gower also prevented Crawford's selection for the MCC winter tour of South Africa. Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee {{in support of his}} son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the [...] "deepest ingratitude". Wisden reported: [...] "The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county." [...] Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: [...] "I <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why I should practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which I trust will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E

500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often psychodynamic {{aspects of}} trauma are {{overlooked}} even by health professionals: [...] "If clinicians fail {{to look through}} a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects." ...|$|E
2500|$|Self-centered {{desires and}} wishes {{are portrayed as}} the base of human malice and {{unhappiness}} because they blind people to the blessings of life with an unattainable dream.

As they leave the scene, they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a lone Cybermat, having survived, approaching Toberman's cybernetic corpse.|$|E
2500|$|A related {{phenomenon}} called [...] "invisible correlation" [...] applies {{when people}} <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a strong association between two events {{because it does}} not match their expectations. This was also found in clinicians' interpretations of the Rorschach. Homosexual men are more likely to see a monster on Card IV or a part-animal, part-human figure in Card V. Almost all of the experienced clinicians in the Chapmans' survey missed these valid signs. The Chapmans ran an experiment with fake Rorschach responses in which these valid signs were always associated with homosexuality. The subjects missed these perfect associations and instead reported that invalid signs, such as buttocks or feminine clothing, were better indicators.|$|E
2500|$|An NTSB {{representative}} {{refused to}} comment further on the preliminary timeline, which investigators were still refining. Two University of Southern California academics used {{the information in the}} NTSB statement to determine that the last text message sent by the Metrolink train's engineer would have been sent a few seconds after he had passed the last red signal. This would make unconsciousness an unlikely cause for this error, since the engineer was able to compose and send the message; instead a psychology professor from the University of Utah raised the possibility that [...] "inattentional blindness" [...] caused the engineer to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the signal.|$|E

For this reason, the formulators of the liturgy obliged Jews to give thanks three times daily (in the final benedictions of the Amidah prayer) [...] "for Your miracles that are with us every day and for Your wonders and Your bounties that are at all times, evening, morning, and noon." ...|$|E

[...] Some cases in which patients have shown allochiria is in copying and drawing clocks from memory. [...] A defect of mental representations may lead the patients to transpose all the elements to the ipsilesional side in drawing tasks. [...] In these drawing and memory tasks, patients with allochiria have a tendency to place all of the hours to the right half of the clock.
