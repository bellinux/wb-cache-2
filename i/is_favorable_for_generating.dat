The {{well known}} {{built-in}} voltage potential for some select semiconductor p-n junctions and various rectifying devices is proposed to <b>be</b> <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> <b>generating</b> DC electricity at “zero bias ” (with no DC bias voltage applied) {{in the presence}} of Johnson noise or 1 /f noise which originates from the quantum vacuum (Koch, 1982). The 1982 Koch discovery that certain solid state devices exhibit measurable quantum noise has also recently been labeled a finding of dark energy in the lab (Beck, 2004). Tunnel diodes are a class of rectifiers that are qualified and some have been credited with conducting only because of quantum fluctuations. Microwave diodes are also good choices since many are designed for zero bias operation. A completely passive, unamplified zero bias diode converter/detector for millimeter (GHz) waves was developed by HRL Labs in 2006 under a DARPA contract, utilizing a Sb-based "backward tunnel diode " (BTD). It is reported to be a "true zero-bias diode". It was developed for a "field radiometer " to "collect thermally radiated power " (in other words, 'night vision'). The diode array mounting allows a feed from horn antenna, which functions as a passive concentrating amplifier. An important clue is the "noise equivalent power " of 1. 1 pW per root hertz and the "noise equivalent temperature difference " of 10 °K, which indicate sensitivity to Johnson noise (Lynch, et al., 2006). There also have been other inventions such as "single electron transistors " that also have "the highest signal to noise ratio " near zero bias. Furthermore, "ultrasensitive " devices that convert radio frequencies have been invented that operate at outer space temperatures (3 degrees above zero point: 3 °K). These devices are tiny nanotech devices which are suitable for assembl...|$|R
30|$|To {{promote the}} wide {{applications}} of mouse EPS cells, another {{important question is}} whether these cells can be generated from somatic cells through reprogramming, thereby bypassing the use of mouse embryos. Remarkably, recently we have established a complete chemical approach to generate chemically-induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) from somatic cells (Hou et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2016). In principle, compared to conventional transgenic methods (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Brambrink et al., 2008; Okita et al., 2008; Stadtfeld et al., 2008; Woltjen et al., 2009), this chemical approach <b>is</b> more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> <b>generating</b> EPS cells from somatic cells, because it circumvents the use of exogenous genetic factors. In this regard, {{it is important to}} explore the possibility of generating EPS cells from somatic cells through a complete chemical approach, which could become a more convenient way to establish EPS cells compared to de novo derivation from mouse embryos.|$|R
40|$|Understanding of how quantum states {{relate to}} their {{environment}} is vital in order to realize quantum technologies. The class of states possessing {{the maximum amount of}} entanglement for a given degree of mixedness is known as maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). In this Thesis protocols for the generation of these states are studied and their use as teleportation channels is examined. Linking different dimensional systems will prove invaluable to the realization of new quantum technologies. Continuous variable resources <b>are</b> quite <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> <b>generating</b> entanglement: the transfer of correlations from such resources to discrete systems is studied showing the possibility to engineer the properties of two-qubit states almost at will. Finally this work tackles the crucial problem represented by the detection of entanglement. The larger the entangled state to be detected the more challenging the task becomes. A full characterization of experimentally realizable entanglement witnesses able to discriminate genuinely multipartite entangled states is discussed in detail.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} spectral model (NSM) {{that describes the}} equatorial oscillations in the zonal circulation, the Quasi-biennial Oscillations (QBO) and Semi-annual Oscillations (SAO). The oscillations are generated by the momentum deposition of small scale gravity waves (GW) described with the Doppler spread parameterization (DSP) of I-lines. We discuss here the GW mechanism {{and some of the}} conditions that <b>are</b> <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> <b>generating</b> the QBO and SAG. Our model reproduces the salient features observed and leads to the following conclusions: (1) In 2 D, a QBO can be generated with a period of about 30 months, peak amplitude close to 20 m/s near 30 km, and downward propagation velocity of 1. 2 km/months, close to the observed values. The QBO phase reverses near 70 km and extends with significant amplitude into the upper mesosphere. (2) SAO amplitudes between 5 and 30 m/s are generated that peak at about 55 km with eastward phase during equinox. A second peak with opposite phase is produced above 70 km. (3) The computed oscillations depend on the rate of radiative cooling and on the chosen eddy viscosity that is tied in the DSP to the GW source but is uncertain to some degree. (4) GW filtering by the QBO at lower altitudes can account for the large variability in the SAO that is observed. The SAO in turn also affects the QBO, and under certain conditions the seasonal (semiannual) variations in the solar forcing can act as a pacemaker to seed and synchronize the QBO. (5) In a 3 D version of the model that computes also tides and planetary waves, the amplitudes of the SAG, and even the QBO, are significantly reduced compared to 2 D. The tides and planetary waves apparently absorb some of the GW momentum that otherwise in 2 D goes into the equatorial oscillations of the zonal circulation. (7) The QBO is also generated in 3 D with Kelvin and Rossby gravity waves that deposit momentum through nonlinear advection and radiative cooling. However, the wave amplitudes need to be carefully tuned in order to generate such an oscillation, in contrast to the GW mechanism which is robust. (C) 1999 COSPAR.

30|$|Tungsten {{trioxide}} (WO 3) {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising inorganic materials, which exhibits excellent electrochromic, photochromic, and gasochromic properties and is widely used in electrochemical, solar energy, optical modulation, flat panel displays, and sensors applications [14, 15]. WO 3 nanowires are mainly used for sensing various nitrogen oxides, while nanoporous WO 3 is used for sensing alcohol [16, 17]. The most important feature of sensor based on WO 3 nanowires is that their response is not affected by the extent of humidity. Diverse forms of WO 3 nanowires such as monoclinic [18], hexagonal [19], and cubic [20] have recently been synthesized by adopting different methodologies. Various methods such as electrochemical deposition, electroless deposition, electrophoretic deposition, template filling, sol–gel method, and pressure injection techniques have been employed for the fabrication of tungsten trioxide on template. Among different techniques, electroless deposition is a straightforward and room temperature method for growing nanostructures. It is actually a deposition process that involves the coating of a material on template surface using a chemical agent without applying electric current. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly ordered hexagonal porous anodized alumina structure using two-step anodization, the two-step anodization <b>is</b> a <b>favorable</b> method <b>for</b> <b>generating</b> template nanostructures of improved morphology and for fabricating cubic tungsten trioxide nanowires by simple electroless deposition method.|$|R
