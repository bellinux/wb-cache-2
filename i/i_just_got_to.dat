500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I somehow just can't," [...] {{he said in}} extenuation. [...] "After I've ben workin' {{like hell}} all week <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> booze up. If I didn't, I'd cut my throat or burn up the premises. But I'm glad you're on the wagon. Stay with it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never wanted}} to drink when I was in hospital. Funny, ain't it? But when I've ben workin' like a slave all week, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bowl up.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] Daughtry agreed pleasantly. [...] "From all you say, the Wide Awake, {{with all}} its youngsters, was sure some craft. Not like the crowd of old 'uns on this here hooker.

50|$|I went {{straight}} {{across the road}} and up by Simmonds Jewellers and when I reached the corner of Middle Street, I decided to turn left through Boatman's Alley. <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the top, and had turned the corner when the bombs fell on Middle Street.

6000|$|... "Great! We'll sure live {{till the}} river opens. Say, Smoke, them dogs of ourn is the goods. A dog-buyer offered me two hundred apiece {{for the five}} of them. I told him nothin' doin'.

I see <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> devote myself to him. Take him away, Johnny. Number Eighteen for him. Later on we can put him in the single compartments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, you see, {{you prove}} my case. You've had {{experience}} in such matters. I don't doubt you've had slathers of proposals. Well, I haven't, and I'm {{like a fish}} out of water. Besides, this ain't a proposal. It's a peculiar situation, that's all, and I'm in a corner. I've got enough plain horse-sense to know a man ain't supposed to argue marriage with a girl {{as a reason for}} getting acquainted with her. And right there was where I was in the hole. Number one, I can't get acquainted with you in the office. Number two, you say you won't see me out of the office to give me a chance. Number three, your reason is that folks will talk because you work for me. Number four, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get acquainted with you, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get you to see that I mean fair and all right. Number five, there you are on one side the gate getting ready to go, and me here on the other side the gate pretty desperate and bound to say something to make you reconsider. Number six, I said it. And now and finally, I just do want you to reconsider." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song on {{this album}} that stood out for Mathis upon {{recollection}} was [...] "Lovers in New York".

"When I {{come to my}} senses," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Boxer, [...] "the {{ship was}} sinking, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> my feet when she went down and took me with her. How I escaped I don’t know. I seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath for years, and then I found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a grating. I clung to it all night, and next day I {{was picked up by}} a native who was paddling about in a canoe, and taken ashore to an island, where I lived for over two years. It was right out o’ the way o’ craft, but at last I was picked up by a trading schooner named the Pearl, belonging to Sydney, and taken there. At Sydney I shipped aboard the Marston Towers, a steamer, and landed at the Albert Docks this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell you-all {{in simple}} A, B, C and one, two, three." [...] Daylight held up one finger and began {{checking}} off. [...] "Hunch number one: a big strike coming in Upper Country. Hunch number two: Carmack's made it. Hunch number three: ain't no hunch at all. It's a cinch. If {{one and two}} is right, then flour just has to go sky-high. If I'm riding hunches one and two, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> ride this cinch, which is number three. If I'm right, flour'll balance gold on the scales this winter.

With Zeppelin writing, if you came up with good things, and {{everybody}} agreed that they were good things, they got used. There was no formula for writing. So Robert and I, by the time everybody turned up for rehearsals, we’d written three or four songs. So we started rehearsing those immediately, because they were something to be getting on with.|$|E
