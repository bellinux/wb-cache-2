500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The debtor irresolutely {{thought of}} <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and said, 'Perhaps you wouldn't object to really being her godfather?' ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{received}} his money, he calmly lit a cigarette, puffed away upon <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and then went}} out slamming the door as hard as possible after him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laid her}} right hand gently on the Doctor's head, and kept <b>it</b> there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so. [...] "Are you at rest now?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|He found Lavendie and Noel in the drawing-room, {{standing}} before the portrait which was nearing completion. He looked at <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>minute,</b> and turned away: ...|$|R
60|$|Priscilla {{waved her}} fan high in air, and then, {{with her right}} hand, she took off the crown, held <b>it</b> up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and {{replaced}} <b>it</b> on her head.|$|R
60|$|I saw the Sergeant {{start as}} the shiver {{of the sand}} caught his eye. After looking at <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so, he turned {{and came back to}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] and Ingleby's manner {{suggested}} that the subject was not worth discussion. [...] "They wouldn't think of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> I'd have nothing {{more to do with}} them if they did." ...|$|E
6000|$|He smiled again, a faint, swift half-smile. [...] "Surprised! That's no {{name for}} <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> I thought I'd fallen clear through. I hope you didn't get a back-set {{on account of}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic form}} starts with an [...] "opening". After {{eliciting}} the audience's suggestion, the ensemble explores <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> in either <b>an</b> unplanned or a predetermined structure. Textbook structures include: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what is this?" [...] cried Michael, sitting {{suddenly}} up. He studied <b>it</b> <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> with <b>a</b> frown. [...] "Pitman, I don't {{care about}} this document a particle," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|She started. That {{was a new}} way {{of putting}} <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> neither spoke. Then she began half defiantly: [...] "Much I am compromised. Of course--I have made a fool of myself--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room and, opening a desk, sat down at <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. Then {{he came back and}} laid a strip of paper {{on the table in front}} of Florence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss, my master. Jenny's asleep, quite worn out. She's {{scarcely}} had {{the child}} off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights, except when I've {{been able to}} take <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine race, boys! Fine race!" [...] was Fatty Hendry's comment. [...] "Just the same, none of {{you would}} have been in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> if I had entered," [...] and at this joke there was a general laugh.|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy thought <b>it</b> over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> Then {{he sighed}} and sighed again.|$|R
60|$|He thought <b>it</b> over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and as he}} {{had watched}} {{carefully}} from the hedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed he could repeat exactly {{what she had said}} and done.|$|R
60|$|He put his 'and {{in under}} the bed-clo'es and felt {{all up and down}} Sam's back, very careful. Sam stood <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 'arf <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and then 'e sat up in bed and behaved more like a {{windmill}} than a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "And oh," [...] exclaimed Cecily in delight, [...] "there's {{the china}} fruit basket with the apple on the handle. Doesn't it look real? I've thought {{so much about}} it. Oh, mother, please let me hold <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> I'll be as careful as careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll have to {{get along}} without it or stay runts," [...] {{retorted}} Faith stubbornly. [...] "Here, Una, you stir it while I set the table. If I leave <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> the horrid stuff will burn. It's half past nine. We'll be late for Sunday School." ...|$|E
60|$|Reverently we put {{gowns and}} letters and {{trinkets}} {{back into the}} old blue chest. Aunt Winnifred closed the lid and turned the key softly. She bowed her head over <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{and then we went}} together in silence down the shadowy garret stairs of Wyther Grange.|$|E
60|$|He studied <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> in {{thoughtful}} silence. He {{looked at}} the picture of the Man who had taken the course being fawned upon by lovely women, while the man who had let this opportunity slip stood outside the group gazing with a wistful envy.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, one of {{the large}} vessels shot out from among the others, and rowed rapidly away. There was desperate {{fighting}} on board of <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> and then <b>a</b> number of men were pushed or thrown overboard, and a loud cheer of victory arose.|$|R
60|$|He {{drew the}} bill {{from the pocket}} of his coatee. Desmond took it, and stood looking at <b>it</b> in silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Then <b>an</b> idea {{occurred}} to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And to you, sir, also, good-night!" [...] the {{professor}} added, taking Tavernake's hand and holding <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> in his, while he looked impressively in his face. [...] "I {{will not say}} too much, but I will say this: so much as I have seen of you, I like. Good-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 601. Strong {{sulphuric acid}} was very effectual in {{rendering}} the platina active. A plate (569.) was heated in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> then washed {{and put into}} the mixed oxygen and hydrogen, upon which it acted as well {{as if it had}} been made the positive pole of a voltaic pile (570.).|$|E
60|$|Boots goes in too, {{holding the}} light, {{and he sees}} Mr. Walmers {{go up to the}} bedside, bend gently down, and kiss the little {{sleeping}} face. Then he stands looking at <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> looking wonderfully like it (they do say he ran away with Mrs. Walmers); and then he gently shakes the little shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Nevitt {{struck a}} chord twice with a sweep of his hand, listened to <b>it</b> dreamily <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> with far-away eyes, and then remarked once more, without even looking up, [...] "The same tooth lost, he says? You both had it drawn! And now another one aches in both of you alike! How very remarkable! How very, very curious!" ...|$|R
60|$|The pillow was gone, {{but there}} was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt <b>it,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> looked at one another as if that {{invisible}} barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no. Dont be {{in such a}} {{hurry to}} get rid of me. Come into my room with me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. I'll talk quietly: I'm not drunk. Ive just slept it off; and I was coming down for some more. You may as well keep me from <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> I suppose Ned hasnt {{forbidden}} you to speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{very gently}} she put {{out her hand}} to him, {{and he took it}} and held <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> She looked up at him as though for a moment she had thought that there might be {{something}} else,--that there might be some other token of true forgiveness, and then she withdrew her hand. 'I had better go now,' she said. 'Good-night; George.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, old fellow;--I didn't mean {{to put you}} on your purgation. I {{want you}} to look at that sketch. Do you know for whom it is intended?" [...] Johnny took up a scrap of paper, and having {{scrutinized}} <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two declared that he had not the slightest idea who was represented. [...] "You know the subject,--the story that is intended to be told?" [...] said Dalrymple.|$|E
60|$|I am fond {{of observing}} faces, and seldom forget one if {{anything}} has particularly attracted {{my attention to}} it. So this morning, as I rode along, I looked at the conductor, as {{there was no one}} else to observe, and he had a pleasant sort of face. Somehow, it looked familiar, and after thinking idly about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> I remembered where I had seen it before.|$|E
6000|$|She read <b>it</b> through. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two she {{examined}} it. [...] "The letter is right enough," [...] she answered, {{after a second}} reading, [...] "though its guileless simplicity is, perhaps, under the circumstances, just a leetle overdone; but the handwriting--the handwriting is duplicity itself: a cunning, serpentine hand, no openness or honesty in it. Depend upon it, that girl is playing a double game." ...|$|R
60|$|He mittened {{his hand}} and beat <b>it</b> violently <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> before exposing <b>it</b> to the frost to strike a match. It was an old man, incontestably dead. In the moment of illumination, they saw a long grey beard, massed with ice to the nose, cheeks that were white with frost, and closed eyes with frost-rimmed lashes frozen together. Then the match went out.|$|R
6000|$|Paul thought <b>it</b> over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> {{and then}} {{said that he would}} himself write to Roger. 'Hetta, do you know, I doubt whether he will ever speak to me again.' ...|$|R
