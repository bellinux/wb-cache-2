Shinagawa noted that even so, the final design for Melllvar is more sophisticated than some energy beings featured in the original series.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was {{complimentary}} of {{his opponents}} afterwards and was pleased there were no new injuries to report. Opposing manager Arsène Wenger praised Fàbregas's performance and reiterated his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Vieira at Arsenal, after speculation regarding the player's impending transfer to Real Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, {{and they are}} quick to pawn her off onto the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening {{has become more}} noticeable, especially its appearance and lack of adequate signage. In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official expressed a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution was {{to build a new}} station underground, but {{due to a lack of}} funding, the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E

5|$|Owner Ben Silberstein died in 1979, {{and passed}} the hotel to his two daughters, Muriel Slatkin and Seema Boesky, wife of stock trader Ivan Boesky. In 1986, Marvin Davis bought the hotel from Silberstein's sons-in-law Burt Slatkin and Ivan Boesky. Boesky had bought the {{outstanding}} 5% of stock for a reported fortune and decided to sell, despite Slatkin's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the hotel. Less than a year later, Davis sold the hotel to the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, for $110 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 draft, the Rockets {{traded for}} the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland (stating chemistry problems with old rival and now teammate Barkley), and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, {{for only the second}} time in 15 years. In the 2000–01 season, the Rockets worked their way to a 45–37 record, but still did not make the playoffs. In the following offseason, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him, the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The proceeding season was unremarkable, as Houston's first season without Olajuwon in almost 20 years finished with a disappointing 28–54 record.|$|E

5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out of a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{them out of the}} foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November, Grayson reiterated his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Kisnorbo but {{stated that}} he had to prove his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds. Kisnorbo got an {{infection}} on his Achilles tendon injury, and stepped up his rehab by going to the USA for treatment. Kisnorbo returned to Leeds' training ground Thorp Arch during mid January. However, on 11 March 2011, it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010–11 season. As Kisnorbo's contract was set to expire in June 2011, he had to prove his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract, or be free to join another club. In March 2011, Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long spell out injured.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the Columbidae {{tend to have}} short legs, short {{bills with}} a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. In a series of {{experiments}} in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown {{to be due to}} their natural <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large, and have eleven primary feathers, and low wing loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly manoeuvrable in flight.|$|E

5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Deimon Devil Bats {{enter the}} spring tournament; they lose to the Ojo White Knights, but Sena decides {{to stay on}} the team because he finds it fun. They train for the autumn tournament, hoping to be the best team in Tokyo and advance to the Kanto tournament and the Christmas Bowl (between the best high-school American {{football}} teams in Japan). Despite Hiruma's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the identity of Eyeshield 21 a secret, Sena reveals his identity to his teammates when they are training in the United States. He later reveals his identity to Mamori and everyone against Bando Spiders, when Hayato Akaba claims to be Eyeshield 21. Sena eventually beats Akaba, claiming the title of Eyeshield 21. At the Kanto tournament, after defeating Shinryuji Naga, his rival Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin, and the Hakushu Dinosaurs, Sena is the tournament's MVP and the Devil Bats win the chance to play in the Christmas Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Roger Just {{states the}} main {{principle of the}} epiklerate was that no man could become the guardian of the property without also becoming the husband of the epikleros. Just uses this principle to claim that any man adopted by the father of an epikleros was required to marry the epikleros. Just states that the forcible divorce and remarriage of an epikleros was based on this principle, arguing that if {{the father of the}} epikleros had not adopted the first husband, the husband was not really the heir. Just sees the development of the epiklerate as flowing from Solon's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the number of Athenian households constant. According to Just, before Solon's legislation, the epikleros was just treated as part of the property, but that Solon's reforms transformed the epikleros into a transmitter of the property and her son the automatic heir to her father's estate.|$|E

5|$|The {{road to the}} Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, {{the city}} undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, {{arriving}} at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset {{the balance of power}} between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.|$|E
5|$|The current club {{ownership}} {{have stated}} that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks. In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, {{with a view to}} developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium. The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E
