50|$|Windows Resource Protection is {{a feature}} in Windows Vista that replaces Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b> It protects {{registry}} keys and folders {{in addition to}} critical system files. The way it protects resources differs entirely from the method used by Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|System File Protection: First {{introduced}} with Windows 2000 (as Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection),</b> {{and expanding}} on the capabilities introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows ME to silently restore the original copy. The original {{is taken from}} a hard drive backup folder (...) or from the Windows ME installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> is a different technology from System Restore {{and should not be}} confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> protects operating system files with no user input.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh-energy rotor {{uncontained}} failure can cause catastrophic damage effects to aircraft systems if not addressed in design. In this paper, numerical simulations of three high-energy rotor disk fragments impacting on U type <b>protection</b> <b>rings</b> {{are carried out}} using LS-DYNA. <b>Protection</b> <b>rings</b> with the same mass and different groove depths are designed to study {{the influence of the}} groove depth. Simulation results including kinetic energy and impact force variation of single fragment are presented. It shows that the groove depth infects both the axial containment ability of the <b>protection</b> <b>ring</b> and the transfer process of energy. The depth of groove ought to be controlled to an appropriate value to meet both the requirement of axial containment and higher safety factor. Verification test on high-speed spin tester has been conducted and shows that <b>protection</b> <b>ring</b> with appropriate U structure can resist the impact of the disk burst fragments. The ring is inflated from a circular to an oval-triangle shape. The corresponding simulation shows good agreement with the test...|$|R
5000|$|Use {{a version}} of Windows that {{includes}} Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b> Windows Me and Windows 2000, both released in 2000, support this form of system <b>file</b> <b>protection,</b> as do Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Its replacement, Windows Resource Protection, was introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and uses a different method of protecting system files from being changed.|$|R
50|$|Windows Resource Protection applies stricter {{measures}} to protect files. As a result, Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> is not available under Windows Vista. In order to replace any single protected <b>file,</b> Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> had to be disabled completely; Windows Resource Protection works on a per-item basis by setting ACLs. Therefore, by taking ownership of any single item, that particular item can be replaced, while other items remain protected.|$|R

Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 include WFP {{under the name of}} Windows File Protection; Windows Me includes it as System <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> (SFP).|$|R

50|$|System File Checker {{was first}} {{introduced}} on Windows 98 as a GUI utility. It offered scanning and restoration of corrupted system files by matching the version number against a database containing the original version number of the files in a fresh Windows 98 installation. This method of <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> was basic. It determined system files by file extension and file path. It was able to restore files from the installation media or a source specified by the user. Windows 98 did not offer real-time system <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> beyond <b>file</b> attributes; therefore, no preventive or reactive measure was available.|$|R
25|$|In {{computer}} science, hierarchical protection domains, {{often called}} <b>protection</b> <b>rings,</b> are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by improving fault tolerance) and malicious behaviour (by providing computer security). This approach is diametrically opposite {{to that of}} capability-based security.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} at improving and/or evolving traditional ring architectures to overcome {{some of its}} limitations, with trans-oceanic ring architecture (defined in ITU-T Rec.

5000|$|Note {{that the}} non-use of ACLs in Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> was a design choice: Not only did it allow {{operation}} on non-NTFS systems, but it prevented those same [...] "bad" [...] installers from failing completely from a file access error.|$|R
40|$|The <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> {{methods used}} within the Linux {{operating}} system {{are based on}} the traditional flags associated with old-style UNIX systems. The Access Control List (ACL) permissions utilized in more recent additions of Linux are constructed on top of these original permissions, and the result is a confusing blend of the old style and new style <b>file</b> <b>protection</b> mechanisms. When permission settings are confusing to the user, incorrect permission settings are more likely; this leads to vulnerabilities in systems which can then be taken advantage of by adversaries. The various Windows operating systems use a more simplistic ACL method for file permission checks, and the authors describe an implementation of these permissions into the Linux file system. Key words...|$|R
50|$|Windows Vista {{and later}} Windows systems {{do not include}} Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection,</b> but they include Windows Resource <b>Protection</b> which protects <b>files</b> using ACLs. Windows Resource Protection aims to protect core {{registry}} keys and values and prevent potentially damaging system configuration changes, besides operating system files.|$|R
50|$|The System File Checker (SFC) {{also comes}} with Windows 2000. It is a command line utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in {{conjunction}} with the Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the Dllcache folder.|$|R

50|$|System File Checker checks {{installed}} {{versions of}} system files {{to ensure they}} were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the DLL hell issue and was replaced in Windows ME by System <b>File</b> <b>Protection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the System File Checker utility (...) was reimplemented as a {{more robust}} {{command-line}} utility that integrated with WFP. Unlike the Windows 98 SFC utility, the new utility forces a scan of protected system files using Windows <b>File</b> <b>Protection</b> and allows the immediate silent restoration of system files from the DLLCache folder or installation media.|$|R
