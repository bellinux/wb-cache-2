25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck <b>detent</b> <b>pin.</b> Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E
5000|$|... 2nd Model - Very {{similar to}} the 1st Model, the second model sported a {{shortened}} cylinder locking bolt. This eliminated the need for internal access via a side plate, which was eliminated. The trigger guard was made longer and deeper. Hunting for US Government contracts, there was {{the addition of a}} <b>detent</b> <b>pin</b> in the barrel release lever, which was recommended by the U.S. Ordnance Department. The introduction of the [...]44-40 Winchester caliber (aka Winchester 1873) was an attempt to capture the market of those who preferred the same cartridge for rifle and revolver, acknowledging the popularity of the Winchester rifles of the day. The revolvers in this caliber were engraved with 'Calibre Winchester 1873'. The [...]44-40 became by far the most popular caliber for the Frontier throughout the remainder of the series. Production of the 2nd model lasted from 1878 to 1882.|$|E
50|$|The rifle's compact dimensions, {{compared}} to the AKS-74, were achieved by using a short 206.5 mm barrel (this forced designers to simultaneously reduce the gas piston operating rod to an appropriate length). Due to the shortening of the operating mechanism the cyclic rate of fire rose slightly to around 700-735 rounds per minute. In order to effectively stabilize projectiles, the barrel's twist rate was increased from 200 mm (1:7.87 in) to 160 mm (1:6.3 in) to adapt the AKS-74U for muzzle velocities of 720 m/s and higher. A new gas block was installed at the muzzle end of the barrel with a muzzle booster, which features an internal expansion chamber inside the cylindrical section of the booster while the conical end acts as a nozzle to increase net pressure inside the gas chamber by supplying an increased amount of propellant gasses from the barrel. The chrome-lined muzzle booster also burns any remaining propellant, which would normally reduce muzzle blast. However, due to the extremely short barrel and conical end of the booster, the muzzle blast is nevertheless extremely large and visible. The muzzle device locks into the gas block with a spring-loaded <b>detent</b> <b>pin</b> and features two parallel notches cut into {{the edge of the}} flash hider cone, used for unscrewing it using the cleaning rod stored under the barrel. The forward sling loop was relocated to {{the left side of the}} carbine and the front sight was integrated into the gas block.|$|E
5000|$|The rifle {{received}} a new barrel with a chrome-lined bore and 4 right-hand grooves at a 200 mm (1:7.87 in) rifling twist rate. The front sight base and gas block were redesigned. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a 90Â° angle {{in relation to}} the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hole. A pair of support brackets are cast into the gas block assembly and are used to attach a BG-15c or GP-25 underslung 40 mm grenade launcher. Like the AK-47 and AKM, the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as the standard muzzle brake or a blank-firing adaptor, while a spring-loaded <b>detent</b> <b>pin</b> held in the front sight post prevents them from unscrewing while firing. The distinctive standard-issue muzzle brake features a large expansion chamber, two symmetrical vertical cuts at the forward end of the brake and three non symmetrical positioned vent holes to counteract muzzle rise and climb as well as lateral shift to the right much like the AKM's offset muzzle brake. A flat plate {{near the end of the}} brake produces a forward thrust when emerging exhaust gases strike its surface, greatly reducing recoil. The muzzle brake prevents backblast from reaching the firer, although it is reported to be harsh on bystanders as the muzzle gases are dispersed to the sides. The standard-issue AK-74 muzzle brake has been subtly revised several times since the 1970s, ...|$|E

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for performing a mechanical release function exhibiting low shock. This system includes two pyrotechnic detents fixed mounted in opposing axial alignment within a cylindrical housing having two mechanical bellows. Two mechanical bellow assemblies, each having one end hermetically bonded to the housing {{and the other}} to the respective actuator pin extending from either end of the housing, ensure that all outgassing and contamination from the operation of the pyrotechnic devices will be contained within the housing and bellows. The pin {{on one end of the}} assembly is fixed mounted and supported, via a bolt or ball-and-socket joint so that when the charge corresponding to that pin ignites, the entire assembly will exhibit rectilinear movement, including the opposing pin providing the unlatching motion. The release <b>detent</b> <b>pin</b> is supported by a linear bearing and when its corresponding pyrotechnic charge ignites the pin is retracted within the housing producing the same unlatching motion without movement of the entire assembly, thus providing complete mechanical, electrical and pyrotechnic redundancy for the unlatching pin...|$|E
