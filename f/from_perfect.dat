5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape is, in part, controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E

25|$|In many areas, {{some form}} of price {{stickiness}} is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting {{in the short run}} to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> competition.|$|E

The families of Honey and Martha were dominated by their fathers, there being {{no sign of a}} mother-figure in their lives. George and Martha's chance at a perfect family was ruined by infertility and George's failure at becoming a prominent figure at the university. Being just a few of many, these examples directly challenge social expectations both within and outside of a family setting.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary rocks {{preserve}} {{remnants of}} the history of life on Earth in the form of fossils, biomarkers, isotopes, and other traces. The rock record is far <b>from</b> <b>perfect,</b> and the preservation of biosignatures is a rare occurrence. Understanding what factors determine the extent of preservation and the meaning behind what is preserved are important components to detangling the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth. The sedimentary record allows scientists to observe changes in life and Earth in composition over time and sometimes even date major transitions, like extinction events.|$|E

In Guyana, Amerindian villages are state elected administrative units {{but there is nothing}} relating to the reservation system and villages are in remote areas. Although the situation of Guyanese Wapishana is better than most part of the Brazilian population of Wapishana, it is still far <b>from</b> <b>perfect.</b> Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region is one of those Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.|$|E
25|$|Surface quality {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and reduce unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, {{this is often}} {{described in terms of}} flatness, while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with float glass may have flatness tolerances as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|E
25|$|For centuries the Tatar {{language}} {{as well as}} other Turkic languages used a modified Arabic alphabet, İske imlâ. The alphabet was far <b>from</b> <b>perfect,</b> both technically and logically (different initial, medium, final and stand-alone forms, no glyphs for short vowels). Because of this some Turkic intelligentsia tended to use the Latin or even Cyrillic script. The first attempts appeared in the mid-19th century among Azerbaijanis. At the same period the Russian missionary Ilminski, along with followers, invented the modified Russian alphabet for all peoples of Idel-Ural. Nevertheless, modern alphabet uses other glyphs: (Ә instead of Ӓ, Ө instead of Ӧ, Ү instead of Ӱ, Җ instead of Ж, Ң instead of Ҥ), the principles of the modern Cyrillic Tatar alphabet was first invented then. But Ilmiski's alphabet were used for the purpose of Christianization and Muslim Tatars didn't use his alphabet. Ilminski's alphabet is still used among Keräşen Tatars. Interestingly, this alphabet still uses pre-revolutionary Russian spelling of Orthodox names, using Fita and Ukrainian I.|$|E

500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage {{of a small group of}} people.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Lawrence Norfolk {{commented that}} Sarah is a [...] "far <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife", but noted that [...] "Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston upon Thames) {{any more than}} he does Little Bee and her {{experiences}} in Nigeria." [...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E
500|$|On 23 October 1991, the Cambodian {{factions of}} the Supreme National Council, along with Vietnam and 15 member {{nations of the}} International Peace Conference on Cambodia, signed the Paris Peace Agreement. For the Cambodian people, two decades of {{continuous}} warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over, although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst {{the leaders of the}} Cambodian factions remained. In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word [...] "genocide" [...] to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979. As a result, Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far <b>from</b> <b>perfect,</b> as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement established the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), in accordance with the UN Security Council’s Resolution 745, and gave UNTAC a broad mandate to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected.|$|E
