5|$|In 1999, the Regional Plan Association {{considered}} a full-length Second Avenue Subway, which included 72nd Street {{as one of}} its planned 31 stations. The entrances to 72nd Street station were to be located at 70th, 72nd, and 74th Streets. The final <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> was released for the station in April 2004. The initial design of the 72nd Street station lasted about eight years, between 1999 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 2015, {{the city}} started {{the process of}} {{environmental}} review for Citywide Ferry. The city requested the draft of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> (EIS) on August 12, 2015, which was completed by April 18, 2016. After public comment, the final EIS was approved on July 28, 2016. The project also had a City Environmental Quality Review, which analyzed the ferry's effects on open space, urban design, natural resources, nearby transportation, noise pollution, air quality, the environment, and public health.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Sussex County legislators {{proposed}} the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment, {{with the addition}} of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US113 and DE24 that could be constructed mostly through state-owned land. Despite opposition to its preferred alternative, DelDOT completed the Draft <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> for the Millsboro–South area in July 2013; the document recognized the significant opposition to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT announced that the Blue Alternative was no longer being considered. Instead, US 113 would be upgraded along its current alignment as part of a Modified Yellow Alternative. However, unlike the original Yellow Alternative, which would upgrade US 113 to a freeway and featured several interchanges, US 113 would not become a freeway under the modified plan. Instead, only some crossroads would be eliminated, US 113 would be expanded to six lanes between its intersections with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-lane northeast bypass of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be built and connect with US 113 at a partial cloverleaf interchange near the northern US 113DE 20 junction. In December 2016, DelDOT completed a Supplemental Draft <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the agency's preferred alternative.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, the Financial Control Board {{considered}} repealing a {{law that}} required <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> for private projects costing more than $1 million. The Financial Control Board said repealing the law {{would make it easier}} to do business in the District. Mendelson opposed the repeal, saying that <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> can reveal potential public health hazards before they occur and that preparation of the statements is not sufficiently onerous to offset the potential benefits. The Financial Control Board ended up increasing the threshold from $1 million to $5 million.|$|R

Ron Wyden, the senior U.S. senator from Oregon, introduced the Klamath Basin Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2014, which was cosponsored by his fellow Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and by Nevada senator Dean Heller.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{released a}} draft supplemental <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> (SEIS) {{for the project}} in October 2015, recommending the demolition of the More Hall Annex in their preferred alternative. In response to the SEIS, building conservation group Docomomo WEWA nominated the More Hall Annex for city landmark status on December 2. The University of Washington filed a lawsuit with the City of Seattle and Docomomo on December 18 over the landmark nomination and whether the city could enforce its landmark preservation laws on state-owned property.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E
5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at Beach 108th Street. One route goes west to Jacob Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and Beach 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> provided for {{an extension of the}} Beach 67th Street bus to Beach 31st Street via Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a bus fleet shortage, resulting in passengers missing their boats. As of June 2017, the East Shuttle bus only runs to Beach 35th Street.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{concern has been}} the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statement</b> in which it shows that for the first 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{based on}} ground and aerial surveys, the land cover data {{base of the}} Pennsylvania Power and Light Company is {{routinely}} used for modelling the effects of alternative generating plant and transmission line sites on the local and regional environment. The development of a satellite-based geographic information system would facilitate both the preparation of <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> by power companies and assessment of the data by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A cooperative project is planned to demonstrate the methodology for integrating satellite data into an existing geographic information system, d to further evaluate the ability of satellite data in modeling environmental conditions that would be applied in the preparation and assessment of <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Committee for a Nuclear Free Island rapidly {{expanded}} its membership, {{and formed a}} coalition with anti-nuclear and peace groups {{in the rest of}} New York City to oppose this. Members distributed over thirty thousand pieces of literature throughout Staten Island over the next few years, and issued highly critical detailed analyses of the Navy's various <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statements,</b> much of which was printed in Staten Island's weekly newspaper, the Staten Island Register. They {{even went so far as}} to contact the colleges and universities that authors of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statements</b> claimed to have attended, and broke up one public hearing with a letter from the University of Michigan disavowing a claim of a doctoral degree.|$|R
50|$|On 22 March 2007 the Railway Procurement Agency {{began the}} {{procurement}} process for Metro North. In October 2007 it {{announced that it}} had a shortlist of four consortiums interested in building Metro North. Draft <b>Environmental</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Statements</b> were published in early 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{injunction}} {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further research {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statement</b> planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
50|$|NEPA's most {{significant}} outcome was {{the requirement that}} all executive federal agencies prepare environmental assessments (EAs) and <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>statements</b> (EISs).
