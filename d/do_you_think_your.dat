2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. [...] "Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and once, when I was a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> mother becomes more {{attractive}} with age?' â€“ 'Because {{she has a lot}} of inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me," [...] Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E

A beer girl from Mainland China approaches him at his table to talk to him, and Chin Keong ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, [...] "You Singaporeans are always complaining. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> life is tough?". During the funeral wake, Seng reveals to his family {{that he did not}} graduate. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No matter! what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean, sir?' was {{the tart}} rejoinder. 'No matter! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> bring <b>your</b> paltry money {{here as a}} favour or a gift; or {{as a matter of}} business, and in return for value received? D--n you, sir, because you can't {{appreciate}} the time and taste which are bestowed upon the goods <b>you</b> deal in, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> give <b>your</b> money away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know that you are talking to a gentleman, sir, who at one time could have bought up fifty such men as you and all <b>you</b> have? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'll take care, my love. We've danced here before. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> father {{objects to}} me now? I've risen in rank. I fancy he's {{still a little}} against me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of the lads? No, indeed; {{but there}} will be bad tidings for the lads if you do not see to it! Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> {{daughter}} is, Sir Duke?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome home, all of you!" [...] cried Randolph Rover. And {{as their}} aunt kissed them, he continued, [...] "And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>your</b> school?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{said sharply}} {{to his brother}} almost before we sat down to the meal. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>your</b> Drummond Keith now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Joan," [...] he said, as {{he entered}} the house, [...] "is a nice little duck for our dinner. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> now <b>think</b> <b>your</b> husband cannot shoot?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, STOO-PID!' {{cried the}} young gentleman. 'Can't you look where you're a-going to--eh? Can't you mind where you're a-coming to--eh? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> eyes was made for--eh? Ah! Yes. Oh! Now then!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not far. I can soon {{take you}} to their igloes. But tell me, man-of-the-woods, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> child had no reason for leaving home in this way except fondness for the young man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do well, landlord," [...] Jacques said, [...] "and {{we thank}} you, for having {{put us in}} the way of saving our legs tomorrow. What time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> cousin will be in?" ...|$|E

30|$|Question: In general, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about <b>your</b> life? My {{life seems}} to be meaningful. Coding is 1 [*]=[*]rather, very or totally right vs. 0 [*]=[*]totally, very or rather wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, not Colonel Mannering; {{but what}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>your</b> acquaintance, Mr. Charles Hazlewood? He talks of taking his lessons here; I wish {{we may have}} {{accommodation}} for him.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I don't {{see what}} you can do, Jim,' he said, 'unless the Rugby chap'll be {{satisfied}} with a pound on account. It's a beastly business. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> pater will give you your money all {{the same as it was}} such a close finish?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, David," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "what else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>your</b> {{patients}} and I talk of when I {{am trying to}} nurse them?

6000|$|As {{he entered}} the town he was struck {{instantly}} by {{the change in the}} faces turned toward him, in the jocular greetings hurled at him. [...] "Hello, Mr. Cossack! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>your</b> chief now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Hilda, you {{are getting}} fanciful! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>your</b> uncle {{was likely to be}} deceived in such a matter, and that he would not have a vivid remembrance of his preserver, even after twenty years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{others at}} once withdrew, {{going back to}} the house, while Miss Starbrow sat down on a garden bench and drew the girl to her side. [...] "Well, my child, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>your</b> new teacher?" [...] she began.|$|R
